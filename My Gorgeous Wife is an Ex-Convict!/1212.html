        <h1>Chapter 1211</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence immediately stopped talking. 'Does Master Reed not care about Grace anymore?' However, what Jason said next stunned Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go and find out why she wants to borrow two million dollars," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Terrence quickly replied and got out of the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was once again the only one left in the large president's office. He walked to the French window and looked down at the figure still standing at the building&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From this angle, he could see only faint specks, but he could still make out which figure belonged to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was strange. Even though he kept telling himself not to pay any more attention to this woman, he just could not stop himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the thought of her pale, haggard face and her body, which was almost unsteady, made him worry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I worried about? What is there to worry about?' Jason said to himself in his heart that Grace only came here because of something that had happened between her and Brian that he refused to give her two million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he was her next best thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He curled his lips in self-mockery. Since when did Jason become the next best thing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he were someone ordinary who could not afford two million dollars, she probably would not have come to him&mdash;not to mention glance at him! He would not even be second best!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop worrying about it!' he scolded himself, but her figure, face, and her pleas kept recurring to him. He felt a twinge of pain in his heart that made him unable to stop himself from raising his hand and pressing it against his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even now, can she still affect my emotions?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark eyes grew even darker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">About half an hour later, Terrence walked into the president's office and reported the investigation results to Jason. "Master Reed, the reason why Miss Cummins asked for two million dollars is probably that her friend Lina is hospitalized with serious injuries. The medical expenses are expected to exceed one million and will cost a lot more for recovery afterward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina is seriously injured?" Jason was stunned. He naturally knew what Lina meant to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not long after they first met, she had told him that Lina was her lifeline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, for Lina's sake, even though she had said yesterday that she did not regret it... She still showed up before him again today to borrow money from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Hadwin Stephenson is missing. Lina was found on the outskirts of a village near Emerald City and was taken to a hospital in tMason Swansonty. But the police haven't found out the cause of Lina's serious injuries," reported Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know what happened between her and Brian?" asked Jason. After all, it was only two million dollars. Given how much Brian cared about Grace, there was no way he would reject her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even... Forget about two million dollars. Even if it was two billion dollars, Brian would find a way to give it to Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"One of Miss Cummins's friends, Chase Harper, has been accused of attempted rape by Miss Cummins's cousin, Stella. Miss Cummins is Chase Harper's lawyer, and Young Master Hart seems unhappy about it. Last night... Miss Cummins stood in front of Young Master Hart's mansion waiting for him until this morning," Terrence told him what he found out.</p></div>
