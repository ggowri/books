        <h1>Chapter 708</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By then, she would use reasonable and legal means to seek justice for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only in this way could she be worthy of the lawyer's robe she wore. Further, she would not be wasting her many years of studying law either!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at the person in front of him, his pupils slightly constricted. For a moment, he could hardly take his eyes off her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she was growing stronger and stronger, transforming without her even knowing it. She was also becoming... More beautiful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why can't Grace be more dependent on me? However, this may be the real her.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;d be too easy on them to spare them both. How about I make them regret what they did to you right now?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace knew it, Jason had led Grace by the hand toward Sean and Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people around them knew Sean and Lily. After all, Lily was a celebrity who often appeared in the media, and Sean, being Lily's fiance, was much more popular in the media than ordinary entrepreneurs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean and Lily were stunned but could only force out a smile when Jason walked over with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed, Miss... Cummins." After a pause, Sean continued saying, "I didn't expect to meet you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Jason did not normally attend such fairs, so Sean naturally did not expect him to be attending today&rsquo;s fair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said with a half-smile, "Speaking of which, Grace and you two are old friends. Your recent apology video is eye-catching, Miss Atkinson. However, many of your fans are defending you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily immediately paled. Her apology post had garnered many comments with some of them attacking Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She deliberately ignored them to blow off some steam. Although she could not lay her hands on Grace because of Jason, her fans could still scold her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect Jason to mention this all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll try to restrain my fans online in the future,&rdquo; Lily looked apologetically at Grace and spoke gently, "I'm sorry, Miss Cummins. I've wanted to apologize to you in person for a long time. I misunderstood that you killed my sister. That's why I did such a horrible thing to you. I hope you can forget the past and forgive me for my recklessness..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Lily who appeared so genuinely apologetic, looking completely different from the woman who had tried to disable her hands with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... They were the same person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was then that she knew just how evil human nature could be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that being in jail was not the worst thing for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had been unlucky then, she might not be able to lift anything with her hands now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I forget and forgive you?" Grace asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily was stunned. 'I was already abject enough. Who does Grace think she is? If it isn&rsquo;t for Jason, I wouldn't bother talking nonsense with Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lily could only suppress her discomfort and explain, "I was only misled by the court's decision. My sister and I had always shared a close relationship, so her death affected me badly..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not that generous." Grace interrupted Lily. "I can never forgive someone who has done me a great deal of harm, so Lily, you don't need to say anything ridiculous like forgetting about the past!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so ridiculous that it made her tremble all over.</p></div>
