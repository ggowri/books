        <h1>Chapter 1717</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... his words seemed to have shattered all her fantasies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you want to marry someone else and never see me again?" Hadwin Stephenson's voice continued ringing in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She stared at him and did not know what to say for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson seemed to have no intention of waiting for her answer. He turned around, intending to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina stepped forward and suddenly grabbed his arm. "Are your injuries serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The tall figure stiffened instantly and paled in the moonlight. "I told you. Don't touch me if you have no feelings for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Can't someone you saved be concerned about your injuries?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Others can, but... not you!" he said, trying to remove his arm from her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina felt her heart hurt even more, but she still firmly grasped Hadwin Stephenson's arm. "Are your wounds serious?" It was all she wanted to know. How injured was he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her as she gripped his arm so tightly, looking like she would not let him go no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If... If only she would not let him leave her side!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you really want to know?" His voice rang unusually hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I do," she answered him affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay. Let go and I'll show you!" said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina hesitated a little before letting go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, Hadwin Stephenson took off his jacket and shirt in front of her... exposing his skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The pale moonlight fell on his body, letting the sight of the white gauze on his body sting her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The thick gauze almost covered his back and chest, but she could still see some faint red on the white gauze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"My injuries have been taken care of, so you don't have to worry," Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as he was about to put his clothes back on, his body stiffened again because her hand was pressing on his back without warning. He could feel it so vividly even through the gauze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It must have been painful, right?" Lina asked in a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pressed his thin lips together tightly. 'Pain...' He had not felt any pain when he fell with her in his arms. All he wanted was for her to be safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... when Anthony Sherman ran over to him to thank him, he started feeling the pain and remembered that she already had another man by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is Anthony Sherman part of the reason why she said she can&rsquo;t be with me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Will she and Anthony Sherman get married and have children one day?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;If that happens, what should I do...?&rsquo; Maybe he would only be able to live a life without any expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson took a step back and put his clothes back on. "Alright, you've seen what you wanted to see. If you care about whether I'm in pain, why don't you... come back to my side? Then I won't be in pain anymore!"</p></div>
