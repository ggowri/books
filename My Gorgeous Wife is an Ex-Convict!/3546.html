        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, just had one cocktail," she replied. Due to the effects of alcohol, her head was feeling a bit dizzy. "William, let's go. I don't want to stay here anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," William replied, taking Jasper's hand and leaving the bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, in a room of the bar, there were several screens displaying surveillance footage of different areas of the bar, including the scene where Jasper, William, and the group of provoking men were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A young man named Roger sat in a chair, staring at the screen where William was seen leaving with Jasper, with a heavy heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He used to envy William, who seemed like a prince from a fairy tale. Every time he saw William with Jasper, he felt inferior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What did he hope for back then? He hoped that one day he could be like a knight in a fairy tale, protecting a princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, knights may eventually turn into dragons, and in the end, who will the princess choose between the prince and the dragon?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, everything is just beginning..." the boy murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, it's just the beginning. Everything has only just begun!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William took Jasper's hand and returned to the campus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you suddenly want to drink?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, I just suddenly felt like having a drink," she muttered. "William, could you please stop for a moment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing her request, he stopped walking as she wished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next moment, her head rested against his chest and her whole body leaned into his embrace. "Let me stay like this for a while, I'm so tired..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She really was exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she felt completely drained of energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William looked silently at Jasper leaning against him and asked after a moment, "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I met someone who looks a lot like Lawrence," Jasper murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's body stiffened suddenly, and he heard her continue, "But that person isn't Lawrence. He said his name is Roger. However, his appearance is like what Lawrence would look like when he grows up. Also, he can play Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige very well. His piano playing reminded me of the scene when Lawrence played Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, is he Lawrence?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," she said in a low voice. "He said his name is Roger, not Lawrence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, William felt a sense of relief, but then he inwardly scolded himself for his despicable thoughts. Why did he feel that way? Did he hope Lawrence would never appear again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that's Jasper's emotional burden! If Lawrence were to appear, Jasper's burden would be lifted. William should hope that Jasper can find Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe you're just thinking about Lawrence too much, that's why you feel like he's here," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Jasper said softly, his voice heavy with indescribable emotions. "Maybe, William. I really miss him so much..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He missed him too much, and this yearning had become increasingly heavy over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As night fell, William watched a video on his phone. The video was none other than the one of Jasper hugging Roger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the video, Roger's appearance was very clear, which made William's heart skip a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Indeed, he looked a lot like Lawrence, like Lawrence grown up. No wonder Jasper would act this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It would make sense for her to mistake him for Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why did he feel a sour, oppressive, and uncomfortable feeling in his heart? Was it jealousy? Was he jealous that Lawrence had disappeared from Jasper's side for so many years, but Grace could occupy so much of Jasper's emotions? Or was he jealous of Roger, being held by Jasper like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fingers kept tightening, almost as if he was about to crush the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, no matter what, Roger was not Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just, if one day the real Lawrence appeared in front of Jasper, who would hold more weight in Jasper's heart, him or Lawrence?</p></div>
