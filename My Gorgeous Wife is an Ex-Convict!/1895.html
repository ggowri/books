        <h1>Chapter 1893</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes flickered slightly as they darkened. "So, are you trying to divorce me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her heart suddenly throbbed violently, only feeling like the man would really divorce her if she said yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said firmly, "I'm not divorcing you! I&rsquo;ll only agree to divorce you when you detest me or have fallen in love with someone else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He sneered. "Is it because of the kids?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She froze. The sarcasm and self-mockery in his eyes pierced her heart deeply. "It's not because of the kids. It's because I love you!" She wanted a life with him, not a divorce!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You love me?" The sarcasm in his eyes intensified. "Yes, you love me. Maybe you do feel some love for me, but it's too shallow. It can't beat Mrs. Watts, who you only knew for two or three years, or your trust in Brian! You can betray me for that woman and go behind my back to ask Brian's men for help. What's the matter? Do you trust him that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "I asked his men for help because I had no other choice. Even if it weren't his men, I would have found someone else if I had the choice! I know I hurt you with Mrs. Watts's incident. My brain couldn't think of a better solution, so I used such a stupid method. As you said, I was sure you would forgive me because you loved me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So what are you going to do if I don't forgive you?" Jason asked indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was silent, and his voice continued to ring indifferently in her ears. "Loving someone too much is tantamount to handing over your life to that person. I once told myself I was willing to give you my life, but when you chose to drive away and hurt me to send that woman back to L City, you destroyed my life, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At that moment, he felt more pain from her betrayal than from his hatred for his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was also at that moment he realized that he was more concerned with how much he mattered to her than getting back at his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wanted to know who she would choose between him and his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the result was nothing but disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It turned out that it hurt so much to love someone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After hearing what Jason had said, Grace's tears instantly came pouring out of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said coldly, "Even if you apologize to me countless times, you won't hesitate to choose someone else once you need to make a decision, right? So, you don't need to apologize to me anymore. I don't think we need to meet each other as well. You can stay in Reed Residence, and I'll move to somewhere else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he pulled her hands off his face and turned away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace instantly found her hands empty, and the warmth in her hands dissipated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay!" Grace suddenly called out to Jason, "You once said that when your mother left your father, even though your father knelt on the ground to beg her, she still chose to leave. Well then... What if I did that to beg for your forgiveness?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason stopped in his tracks and turned around to look at her with shock and disbelief.</p></div>
