        <h1>Chapter 2246</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss went back to the hospital and said to the doctor in charge. "I've told my wife about me storing my blood in the hospital, but I don't want her to know anything else. I hope the hospital can keep my secret."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor froze and immediately said, "Yes, the hospital won't say anything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss nodded and left the hospital again. He returned to the company. However, as soon he stepped into the company, he saw Jacqueline Bowman at the reception desk. She looked as if she was trying to find a way to get in. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jacqueline Bowman saw Martin Weiss, her face lit up. She immediately rushed forward and said, "Mr. Weiss, how are you? I came here to see you. Do you remember me? I'm Kyla's friend. I helped Kyla out a lot in... uh... that place. We&rsquo;ve also met at the Stephenson family's full moon party."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss glanced at her coldly. "What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." Jacqueline Bowman made an embarrassed expression and said, "It's something about Kyla. I... I wish to speak to you alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes narrowed slightly. Then, he said, "We'll talk about it in my office." With that said, Martin Weiss turned and walked toward the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was delighted and quickly followed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at Martin Weiss's office, Jacqueline Bowman's heart stirred. He was the president of a large corporation. His office was so large and imposing. Besides, the employees she met when she walked in with him all bowed to him. It made her feel as if they were bowing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How wonderful it would be if she could have Kyla's life and become Martin Weiss's wife?! They were both ex-convicts, but why were their fates so different?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman felt even more jealous at the thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt even more resentful when she recalled the day Kyla refused her request. She only wished to destroy Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the office, Martin Weiss looked at Jacqueline Bowman coldly. "Go on. What do you have to say about Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh&hellip; Well, Mr. Weiss, you should know that Kyla has a child, right? The child was conceived before Kyla went to prison," said Jacqueline Bowman said, not knowing Nelson was Martin Weiss's son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't know how much Kyla loves the father of this child. She could have had an abortion back then, but she wouldn't do it. She endured everything those bullies did to her to keep her child. They cut off all her hair, made her crawl under their crotch, and even forced her to bark like a dog..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman told him about all the humiliation Kyla had to endure in prison. Her purpose was nothing more than to let Martin Weiss know how much Kyla loved the child's father and was willing to endure it all just to give birth to this child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was so shocked to hear that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had gotten people to look into what had happened to Kyla in prison, but they could not find anything because it was so long ago. Their report to him just consisted of one sentence&mdash;&rsquo;Suffered a lot of difficulties in prison.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He finally found out what had happened to her from Jacqueline Bowman's mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He made her go through all that!</p></div>
