        <h1>Chapter 1348</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ve already replied that the patient who received the bone marrow transplant has refused to donate their liver. You'll be completely at ease once the woman's dead," said Shane Currey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, once Kyla Corbyn is dead, I won't have anything to worry about,' thought Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was a good piece of news for her... She could finally make Kyla Corbyn disappear from this world!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason quickly found the information on Kyla Corbyn's bone marrow donation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The hospital&rsquo;s records do show that Paisley Daniels donated her bone marrow to Martin Weiss. They also have Kyla Corbyn's donation record, but the recipient of Kyla Corbyn's bone marrow is blank."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Blank? Grace was stunned. "How could it be blank?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's blank because someone doesn't want others to know who it is. Coincidentally, Paisley Daniels, Kyla Corbyn, and Martin Weiss have the same blood type. Furthermore, Paisley Daniels and Kyla Corbyn donated their bone marrow on the same day," Jason continued saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes widened. "So it's possible that Martin Weiss was the recipient of Kyla's bone marrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "The odds are probably more than 99%. The hospital records have been tampered with and the original files are gone, but there's a record in the bone marrow bank. There was only one donation of Kyla Corbyn's rare blood type during that period. At that time, the staff of the bone marrow bank had called Paisley Daniels and Kyla Corbyn respectively. Paisley Daniels refused while Kyla Corbyn agreed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gasped. 'So... it's true!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never thought Kyla and Martin Weiss would have such a connection! Martin Weiss had been bent on taking revenge on Kyla and even personally sent her to prison. However, he must have never thought that the person who selflessly donated him their bone marrow was Kyla!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla... also probably never expected that the person she saved was the one who ruined her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla is... so unfortunate. Does Martin Weiss know he has hurt the woman who saved his life?" Grace's voice broke into sobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you upset again?&rdquo; Jason looked at Grace's slightly red eyes. "Looks like I can't let you meddle in Kyla Corbyn's affairs anymore, or you'll always be upset. I can't allow that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I... I just find it unfair for Kyla." Grace quickly pulled herself together and said, "Why don't I go to Martin Weiss tomorrow and tell him about it? Only he can save Kyla now. If he's willing to donate Kyla his liver, then Kyla will have a chance to live!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't panic. Even if you go to Martin Weiss and tell him that, he may think that we&rsquo;re deliberately saying that to save Kyla Corbyn," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't we have the records from the bone marrow bank? Didn't Paisley Daniels refuse to donate?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "But he could easily say that she agreed afterward. The bone marrow bank just didn't record it. We need more evidence if we want to convince Martin Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath. "Then let&rsquo;s find more evidence. We must make Martin Weiss believe it was Kyla who saved him no matter what! He must save Kyla!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if he still won't?" Jason raised his eyebrows and said, "After all, according to my investigation, Kyla Corbyn's father almost ruined the Weiss family. After Martin Weiss revived the Weiss family, he retaliated against Kyla Corbyn because her father had already passed away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a scandal like that, sometimes a person might not be willing to help even if they knew the truth.</p></div>
