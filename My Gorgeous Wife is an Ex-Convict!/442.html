        <h1>Chapter 441</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace was done talking, she had no intention of continuing the debate with Andrea. She informed the nurse who was with her, and they went to the next station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea was left at the same spot. She glared spitefully at Grace&rsquo;s back view. When she turned around once again, she was faced with the stares of her fellow colleagues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea smiled sheepishly and rejoined the queue while feeling defeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After going through so much trouble, she still did not find out how Grace had the money to afford a VIP package.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace was done with all the necessary check-ups, she went back to where Jason was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re done?&rdquo; Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, but some of the reports can only be done in the afternoon,&rdquo; Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then, let's have breakfast. You haven&rsquo;t eaten anything since this morning.&rdquo; Jason offered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Grace then left the hospital with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Where do you want to eat?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Let's just find a random place to eat nearby.&rdquo; It was only 9-ish in the morning. Most stalls had not packed up yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He smiled and took her hand in his as they walked toward the nearby stalls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the shaobing, youtiao, and douhua that were sold by the stalls. She craved them, thus she said to Jason, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we eat from this stall? I haven&rsquo;t eaten these in a long time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to the stall owner to order before looking at Jason. &ldquo;What do you want to eat?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a set of what you&rsquo;re having as well.&rdquo; He wanted to try the food that she craved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A set of shaobing, youtiao, and douhua was a regular breakfast staple for Grace in the past. However, as the years went by, inflation kicked in and this set of three items cost seven dollars now. After she came out of prison, she no longer bought these whenever she walked past such stalls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, seven bucks for breakfast was a luxury for her at that time. Most of the time, she tried to keep her breakfast under two bucks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;By the way, after we&rsquo;re done with the hospital today, can you accompany me over to my rented unit?&rdquo; Grace suddenly mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why do you want to go there?&rdquo; Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I was thinking of picking up some stuff and discussing with the house owner regarding the cessation of the lease.&rdquo; After all, leaving that house inhabited was not the way to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Previously, she had plans to return to that place. As such, she never ended her lease contract.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she had feelings for Jason and they were in a serious relationship, she felt that she should stop the lease on that rented house to save some money as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Let's go over after breakfast since your reports won&rsquo;t be ready till the afternoon.&rdquo; Jason suggested.</p></div>
