        <h1>Chapter 597</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would wonder how beautiful she would look wearing the dresses he had bought for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he never had such a shock. The woman in front of him was wearing an ordinary and cheap dress. She walked slowly to the mirror and looked at it, but this simple act made his eyes redden instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was now standing in front of the mirror, looking at the dress she was wearing. She took a fancy to the dress because it looked like the floral dress her grandmother had bought her when she was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, the floral dress ripped and was thrown away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even cried for it back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, the dress was quite long. She did not have to worry about flashing something when riding the electric bike in it. Besides, it was not expensive&mdash;280 dollars. She could still bargain the price in a shop like this, making it even cheaper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think, Miss? Do you like it?" asked the shop owner as she stepped forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right, but can you reduce the price a little?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... We're already selling at quite a low price, and the price..." Before the shop owner could finish, it was as if her vocal cords had been jammed suddenly as she stared blankly behind Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was slightly stunned. However, before she knew what was happening, a pair of arms was hugging her tightly from behind. A cool breath clung to her neck and cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it you?" Brian's voice rang in her ear hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and immediately tried to break away from Brian's sudden embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he hugged her tighter and pressed his face against her neck. He repeatedly muttered, "Is it you? You're her, aren't you? You're her..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go, Brian. I don't know what you're talking about!" shouted Grace. She had no idea why Brian was behaving just as he was the other night when he got drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The problem was he was not drunk now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're her, aren't you? Why else would you look like her... Why... Why are you the only one who gives me that feeling..." he whispered as if the person he had been looking for had just appeared in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know what you're talking about. But you'd better let me go now, or..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Or what?" He broke into a sarcastic laugh. "I've let go so many times. I should never have let go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shop owner was completely dumbfounded right now. She had no idea what the man and woman in front of her were trying to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only feel his arms hugging her tighter and tighter. His voice even sounded like there was a lump in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you've made a mistake. I'm not the one you're looking for!" said Grace. She recalled what Jason had told her earlier, that Brian was looking for a girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're not her, why did you choose this dress?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She put on the dress and made him feel as if he had seen what the little girl would like when she grew up. It was as if she was standing in front of him in a floral dress, smiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This scene seemed like something he had only seen in his dreams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just like the dress, there's no other reason!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no matter how hard she tried, she could not break free from Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, Brian seemed dead set on her. He held her tightly and kept saying, "Tell me you're her, the one I've been looking for! Do you know how long I've been looking for you? How much I regret letting go of your hand?"</p></div>
