        <h1>Chapter 1384</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had little time left and did not want to waste her limited time seeing doctors. She just wanted to spend more time with her mother and son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know that. I'm mentally prepared. Please increase the dosage for my painkillers. The pain has gotten a little worse recently," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The attending doctor sighed and understood the choice Kyla Corbyn had made. However, what surprised him was Kyla Corbyn's calmness in the face of death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had seen many patients who struggled to hold on to the possibility of surviving once they knew they were already in their last days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even those who did not have the money for treatment would try their best to ask if there was any way to buy them more time. They would be too reluctant to face such a disease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Few were as calm as Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, people like this often had a sorrowful story behind them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'll give you a larger dose, but you can't take too much of this medicine. The more you take it, the more resistant you become to it. Perhaps, no amount of medicine can stop the pain later on, and it'll only accelerate the deterioration of the cancer cells," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it. Thank you," replied Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After taking her medicine, Kyla Corbyn was about to leave the hospital when she received a phone call from her mother. On the phone, her mother's voice sounded urgent. "Kyla, what do we do? Nelson... was... He was picked up by someone from the Daniels family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was stunned. "What did you say? The Daniels family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, the kindergarten teacher said someone from the Daniels family picked Nelson up. Paisley Daniels came herself, saying she was Nelson's stepmother and taking Nelson to see his father. The Daniels family had also talked to the kindergarten&rsquo;s principal, so the teacher couldn&rsquo;t stop them," Mrs. Corbyn said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was now distraught too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn could only comfort her by saying, "Mom, don't worry. I... I'll go find Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, okay! Nelson must be safe! Why didn't I go pick him up earlier? This wouldn't have happened if I had gotten there earlier." Mrs. Corbyn kept blaming herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn comforted her mother for a while more before hastily ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only thing she must do now was to quickly find Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her phone rang again. It was an unfamiliar phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla Corbyn answered it, she heard Paisley Daniels's voice on the phone. "Kyla Corbyn, Nelson is currently with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want to do with my son?" Kyla Corbyn asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's Martin's son and I'm going to be his stepmother. Of course, I want to bond with him. Come over alone if you want to see your son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Paisley Daniels gave an address and the number of a private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn hesitated. If the Daniels family wanted to do something to Nelson, they probably would not choose a place like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn knew that restaurant. It was just an ordinary restaurant, not the kind the upper class liked to patronize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is the Daniels family up to?' Kyla Corbyn wondered. However, whatever the Daniels family was up to, she had to get Nelson back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not comfortable with the idea of Nelson being with the Daniels family.</p></div>
