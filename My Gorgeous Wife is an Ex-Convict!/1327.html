        <h1>Chapter 1326</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You mean Hadwin Stephenson refused to get in touch with your men?" Grace asked in astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, and you might see him on the news in a few days. He would regain control of the Stephenson family, but with the Jackson family's help," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to wait until he found out what Hadwin Stephenson had to do with the Jackson family's real heiress before telling her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was clear that Hadwin Stephenson and the Jackson family were working faster than he expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, it was also thanks to the stupidity of the Stephenson family's first wife. She did so many things after Hadwin Stephenson's disappearance and lost favor. Of course, it would lead to her downfall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace urged him, saying, "You still haven't said what has changed with Hadwin Stephenson. It should be a good thing if Hadwin Stephenson can regain control of the Stephenson family. He probably had to do so even though he had the Jackson family's help. Elizabeth Jackson from the Jackson family might have tampered with Lina's car and caused us to almost have an accident, but Lina should be able to understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if Hadwin Stephenson has gotten together with another woman?" asked Jason. After all, even if he did not tell her now, she would probably learn about it once Hadwin Stephenson appeared in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Grace stared at Jason with wide eyes. "Did he... have a change of heart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a possibility. Maybe he&rsquo;s faking it just to use the Jackson family. However... No matter what, I think it would be better not to tell Lina about Hadwin Stephenson when she wakes up, lest she gets upset. Let's tell her after we figure everything out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded but felt restless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Hadwin Stephenson has had a change of heart, then... what should Lina do?' Grace's face darkened, and her brows furrowed at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, don't overthink it. Hadwin Stephenson having a change of heart is just the worst-case scenario. Besides, didn't you tell me Hadwin Stephenson loves Lina very much?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, he... loves Lina very much!" Grace let out a long breath. As if seeking comfort, she asked Jason, "So he won't betray Lina, will he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason caressed Grace's furrowed brows. "I wouldn't if it were me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. She knew what he meant. After all, it was hard to say whether Hadwin Stephenson would have a change of heart as they were not Hadwin Stephenson himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The topic seemed to come to an end, and Jason continued to massage Grace's feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him who was looking down and suddenly said, "I met Brian at the mall today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body stiffened a little. He stopped what he was doing and looked up at her. "It's alright if you don't tell me about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "But I don't want any misunderstandings between us. I know you minded what I had with Brian, so I want to be clear with you. I told Brian today that I'm happy with my life now. I told him you're the one I love and I hope he'll stop dwelling on the past."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. "Do you really think you're happy with your life now?"</p></div>
