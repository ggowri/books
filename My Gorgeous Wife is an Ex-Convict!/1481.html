        <h1>Chapter 1480</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace got up and gently embraced Lina. "I'm sorry for upsetting you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What are you talking about? I just want you to be okay and not be affected by the pain of the past. After all, you need to keep moving forward, don't you?" said Lina as she sniffled and forced a smile at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace's nose turned sore when she saw her best friend's smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was still suffering from her heartbreak but chose to bury the pain and face others with an optimistic smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll be okay. You don't have to worry about me. You're the one who needs to be okay. Hurry and get well. You'll have to play with my kids when they're born," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We're all going to be okay." Lina hugged her best friend back and once again said to herself, 'I'll get over Hadwin Stephenson. I definitely will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just treat my relationship with Hadwin Stephenson as another one of my memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'From now on, they're just memories!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The weather was getting colder and colder. It was getting closer and closer to Chinese New Year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stroked her belly. She had not seen Jay for several days. These days, she kept thinking about what Lina had said to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Keep... moving forward.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She asked herself whether she loved him, and the answer was&hellip; yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she did not love him, she would not have been in so much pain when the cruel truth was laid out in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she did not love him, she would not have hesitated so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She loved him. She loved the man who had indifferently watched her get imprisoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She once swore that she would be good to him and not leave him like his mother had left his father, but now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked through the photos on her phone. One of them showed Jason with his hand pressed against her belly, his face full of gentleness and love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was the picture she took of him when she made him feel the babies' movements in his office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were so happy back then...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace picked up her phone and dialed Jason's number. It was the number he got after she bought him the cheap phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On that phone, there was only her number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the other end of the line, the phone only rang twice before someone picked it up and the familiar voice sounded. "Grace..." However, there was a note of caution in his voice, as if he was in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace replied, "It's me. I... It's Chinese New Year in two days. I want to have dinner with you on New Year's Eve, may I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sure... Sure! Of course, you can!" His voice sounded somewhat hurried yet also joyful. "We'll have New Year's Eve dinner together. I... I'll prepare for it. You can tell me anything you want to eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," Grace said quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the call was over, she looked down at her bulging belly again. "Babies, can you help me forget all those unpleasant memories? I don't want to... live with regret for the rest of my life. Is that alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the other end of the phone, Jason was visibly happy when he ended the call.</p></div>
