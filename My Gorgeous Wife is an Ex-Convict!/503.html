        <h1>Chapter 502</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin turned around and looked at Taylor Carline. A moment later, he chuckled and said, "It seems that there really is a misunderstanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said it carelessly with a look of contempt, and Taylor Carline's face was immediately red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was implying that he was not someone Lina would like as he could not even win against Hadwin, but Taylor Carline could not argue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin once again turned to Lina and said, "Tell me if there are any more misunderstandings next time. Don't let others think that you don&rsquo;t have a boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he lovingly touched Lina&rsquo;s head. Lina immediately felt like she had a spotlight on her, attracting even more envious eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the problem was... She was going to break up with Hadwin! The more people envied her now, the more she would be ridiculed in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked miserable. She was suffering but could not let it show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The meeting ended in such envy and embarrassment for Hattie Robson and Taylor Carline that they left the room almost immediately. Their colleagues, who had mocked Lina earlier, also left looking sour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director looked at Lina with a look of relief and did not forget to praise Lina in front of Hadwin. "Lina has always performed well in our firm. What happened yesterday was a misunderstanding. I think that&rsquo;s now clear to everyone at the meeting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want such misunderstandings to happen again in the future," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's for sure," replied the director. Then, he said to Lina, "Lina, tell Chairman Stephenson about the project you're working on now. You'll be in charge of the project."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was surprised that she... got a promotion?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could answer, the director had already left the meeting room. There were only Hadwin and Lina left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at Hadwin and bit her lip slightly before saying, "You don't have to invest in my project."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want to see your hard work go to waste. Didn't you spend a lot of time and effort on this project?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could only feel her heart being gently touched by his words. If it were not for the knowledge that their relationship was fake, she would probably have allowed herself to immerse in this man&rsquo;s gentleness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, no woman would not like their boyfriends to be considerate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she must not be caught up in it. If she did, perhaps when they finally broke up, she would be beyond redemption.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment's hesitation, she asked, &ldquo;Did you do it on purpose?" If he just wanted to invest in the project, he did not have to come to the company in person. He even asked the director to hold a meeting and talked so deliberately during the meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I did it on purpose." Hadwin admitted calmly. "This will save you any unnecessary trouble later on. I'll be humiliated if people think my girlfriend is interested in someone else's boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Humiliated... Lina inexplicably felt a faint disappointment. Yes, he only came here today to save himself from humiliation. </p></div>
