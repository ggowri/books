        <h1>Chapter 1199</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, a strange scene formed at Reed Group's entrance. Grace was throwing up by the trash can while a security guard stood beside her. Not far away, Jason was standing where he was with his eyes on Grace. His face showed no joy or anger. Terrence, the driver, several company executives, and several security guards who came over all stood around Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace finally threw up to the point that she had nothing left to throw up and looked up somewhat weakly, she found that she... was being watched!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time she was being watched by so many people while she threw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was also watching her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, he looked grim and unapproachable in a black suit and matching turtleneck sweater.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked awkward and wanted to leave, but she had to go in his direction to take the bus home. Therefore, Grace could only lower her head awkwardly and take out a tissue from her bag to wipe the corners of her lips. She speed-walked, trying to leave this place quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not move and stood where he was. The closer she got to him, the stronger Grace felt that she was being watched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was about to walk around him, the residual sick feeling suddenly came back and she felt like throwing up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Blaargh!" Grace could not help bending over and throwing up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, the expressions of everyone around them changed. Those who did not know Grace just looked at Grace with a &lsquo;she's done for&rsquo; look. How dare the woman throw up in front of Master Reed?! Was she trying to kill herself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Furthermore, some vomit had spilled on Master Reed's shoes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Terrence did not think so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because... Even though Grace could not help throwing up in front of Master Reed, he never shied away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace had become a taboo for Master Reed and he had been indifferent to Grace the several times they met each other, the woman still held a place in his heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, how could Master Reed watch a woman throw up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After throwing up for a while, Grace managed to suppress the sick feeling. She wiped the corners of her lips with a tissue quickly. Stumbling, she stood up straight and said to Jason, "I... I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His deep peach blossom eyes only looked at her intently, but his eyes were no longer affectionate. They were indifferent. "You want me to forget about everything with only an apology?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She felt that he was speaking about what was going on right now, yet it felt like it was about something else instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'll clean the place up," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And the shoes," Jason said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned for a few seconds, then she suddenly realized that what he meant was that she had just thrown up and the vomit had accidentally stained the upper of his shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly crouched down, pulled out a fresh tissue, and began wiping the upper of his shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he looked down at her crouching in front of him, it reminded him of the time when she had knelt before him and begged him to let her go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was looking down at her from the same angle!</p></div>
