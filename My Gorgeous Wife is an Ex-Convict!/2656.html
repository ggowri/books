        <h1>Chapter 2654</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared blankly at the scene before her. 'Did Brian... knock down these people?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But could he knock down that many people on his own?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're... not hurt, are you?" she asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled faintly and said, "They can't hurt me. Alright, let's get out of here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after taking two steps, he realized she was still standing in the same spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" He turned to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath as her dangling hands clenched into fists. "My... My feet are a little weak, so I might walk a little slower."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had almost used up all her strength trying to walk. She wobbled and was about to stumble after only two steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian lunged forward, grabbed Valda Theller, and picked her up in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shouted, "Hey! Are... Are you going to carry me out of here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else? You might not even make it out in another hour if you go out by yourself," said Brian before striding out of the washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could only feel many people's eyes on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On any other day, she would be blushing and feeling embarrassed, but she was still in fear from the incident earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian almost reached the bar entrance, someone stopped him. "What's the matter? Are you just going to leave after beating people up? You can't get out of here so easily today..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, another man hurried over and slapped the person hard. "What are you talking about? Hurry and apologize to Young Master Hart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person who got slapped was confused. The man who hurried over pressed the man&rsquo;s head and bowed to Brian. "Young Master Hart, my subordinate doesn't know his manners. Please forgive him, Young Master Hart. Take... Take care. I'll look for you and formally apologize later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked terrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glared at him coldly and walked out of the bar with Valda Theller in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the person who stopped Brian earlier looked uneasily at the man who came afterward. "Boss, who&rsquo;s Young Master Hart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His boss had a considerably tough background too, but he seemed apprehensive when facing that Young Master Hart earlier. The subordinate had never seen him this way. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That was the crown prince!" the man said worriedly! He wondered if the crown prince would take it out on him for what had happened in his bar today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The crown prince?" The subordinate forze. 'The crown prince of the entertainment industry seems to be the only person in Emerald City dubbed the crown prince. Oh, yes. He has the surname Hart too!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The subordinate could not help sweating profusely at the thought of it. He regretted blocking the crown prince's way and speaking so harshly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Boss hadn't rushed over to stop me, I would have probably...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get the names of everyone who made trouble today. Never let them set foot in the bar again," the boss said.</p></div>
