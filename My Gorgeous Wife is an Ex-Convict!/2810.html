        <h1>Chapter 2808</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, Nelson. Accompany your sister for a while first. I want to talk to your dad alone," Kyla said to her son. As she spoke, she put her already six-month-old daughter on the soft couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn then took his sister's toy and played with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Martin Weiss and said, "Let's go somewhere to talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced at her before lifting his hand to take Kyla's. He then headed toward his study on the second floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla tried to pull her hand away, but Martin Weiss muttered, "We have servants in the mansion. If you don't want them to think we're too indifferent to each other, you'd better stay still."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened and clenched her teeth. She did not withdraw her hand again but followed Martin Weiss to the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After entering the study and closing the door, Martin Weiss quickly released his hands and said to Kyla, "Alright, what do you want to talk to me about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want to tell you that I&rsquo;ll spend the day at the store and return with Nelson after he finishes school in the afternoon every day. I&rsquo;ll try my best to cooperate with you in any events, but I hope you can inform me in advance," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure. No problem," answered Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, can you replace the servants in the mansion with hourly workers? For example, they can clean up and stuff when the kids and I are away during the day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Others will find it strange," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But we have to act in love at all times if the servants are in the mansion. I think we'll need to be focused at all times. Someone might realize that something's wrong if we're not careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at Kyla. "Didn't you say you love me? Why do you need to concentrate on trying to love me, then? All you have to do is show how much you love me. It's up to me whether I can concentrate on playing my part."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly. "But I don't have the confidence to look like I love you all the time. It&rsquo;ll be too tiring... to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression sank slightly as he approached her. "What's the matter? Are you trying to tell me that you don't love me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's not that I don't love you... It's just that I've put away my affection and hid it at the bottom of my heart. I don't want to let it out anymore. I'll only break my heart more if I let it out.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Kyla said, "When I signed the divorce papers back then, it meant that I had gotten over our relationship. Martin Weiss, I've moved on. So I'm afraid I can't pretend to love you at all times. I&rsquo;ll give myself away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said... she had moved on, he felt as if something had stung his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... had moved on. Ironically, he had not moved on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you really moved on?" He continued to advance on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt pressured as she moved her feet and stepped back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she took a step back, he took a step closer until he pinned her against the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I have." Kyla tried to keep herself speaking calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what Martin Weiss did next broke her calmness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips suddenly fell as he kissed hers heavily. She froze for a moment before beginning to struggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pushed him away almost as hard as she could. "Martin Weiss, what are you doing?"</p></div>
