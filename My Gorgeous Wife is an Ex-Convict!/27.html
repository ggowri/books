        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she heard this, she just took it as a joke. This had been specially made by the Stevens family and the Atkinsons for the express purpose of announcing their marriage alliance. Who would dare to take it down?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was dark in front of her eyes. His hand touched her skin, and heat radiated from his touch.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a while, she pulled his hand down and looked up at him. "Jay, thank you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought that he was trying to comfort her by saying these things. "Alright, let's go. Let's go home for dinner." As she spoke, she held his hand and walked in the direction of their residence.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced at the big projection ad and then followed her steps to leave.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back at the apartment, Grace went to the security office in the community to retrieve an express delivery. It was the sweater she had bought for Jay.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She opened the package, took out the sweater, and touched the material. It wasn&rsquo;t bad. She&rsquo;d been worried. For that price, the quality was quite good.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay, come and see if this sweater suits you," she said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sweater had a blend of blues and greens. When Jason put it on, Grace's eyes lit up. &ldquo;Oh, you look so good!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, as if she had thought of something, she said, "Jay, bend down a little."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason did as she asked and leaned down. Grace held a comb and pulled his hair back.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whoa.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had always known that he was good-looking, but now that she could really take in all of his features, he was ridiculously handsome.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Far too good-looking for someone like her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"My brother is really attractive."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her word "my" seemed to please him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She could not help but sigh. "If you were to tie your hair back like this when you&rsquo;re handing out flyers, you&rsquo;ll have scores of girls chasing to snatch them from you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He laughed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How about we go to the hair salon to tidy up your hair later? It's a pity that your beautiful eyes are always covered by it," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's there to feel sorry for? My current state will only be available for you," Jason said. &ldquo;We are family, after all.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace burst out laughing. "You can wear this sweater tomorrow. Get changed and I'll wash it for you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright," he asserted.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She took out her phone and took a picture of him in the sweater, then moved her finger and updated her Facebook.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Speaking of which, there were almost no friends in her socials There were actually only two people. One was Lina, and the other was Jay.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let Lina look, I'm sure she'll be so jealous that I have such a handsome younger brother," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sure enough, after a while, Lina "liked" the post and followed up with a sentence: &ldquo;Nice sweater. Send me the link, I&rsquo;ll buy one for my dad.&rdquo; Then: &rdquo;By the way, your new younger brother is just like a clothes rack. He should try to be a model. There aren&rsquo;t any real requirements besides being hot. And he checks that box.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace thought about it and agreed. She then asked Jay, "What do you think about being a clothes model?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Not much," he said.</p></div>
