        <h1>Chapter 2310</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated a little but did not reject Mallory Malcom's kindness. After all, what he said was true. The hotel staff might not be informed in time in case something happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, then," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mention it. You're too kind, Miss Corbyn," said Mallory Malcom as he took Kyla to a five-star hotel downtown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were all kinds of emergency buttons in the hotel room. She just needed to press the button if anything happened in the room and the hotel staff would come over within three minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After settling down Kyla, Mallory Malcom said, "Miss Corbyn, please take a rest first. Feel free to contact me if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came to L City to see Martin Weiss. Please put me in touch with him," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll do it," Mallory Malcom answered and left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Despite being a little tired, Kyla removed the contents of her luggage, took a change of clothes, and went into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Warm water washed her body as Kyla looked down at her already bulging belly. "Baby, do you think Daddy will see me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What should she do if he did not want to see her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the hotel, Mallory Malcom drove to Weiss Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the Weiss family house's study, Mallory Malcom stood in front of Martin Weiss and reported the details of his journey to fetch Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Weiss says that she&rsquo;d like to meet with you and talk to you about something, Chairman Weiss," said Mallory Malcom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said in a cold voice, "Meet? If she wants to eat, play, or buy something in L City, just get her whatever she wants. There's no need for us to meet. I have no intention of meeting her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Mrs. Weiss seems to have come to L City just to meet you. If you don't meet her, she'll probably..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let her wait till she gets bored and leave. Tell her I won't see her no matter how long she stays in L City," Martin Weiss said coldly, his handsome face chilly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Mallory Malcom. He felt that the current Chairman Weiss and the Chairman Weiss who told him that he would be responsible for Kyla&rsquo;s affairs in the future were two different people. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, Chairman Weiss&rsquo;s face was full of pain, despair, love, and heartbreak when he assigned him that task&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if all his emotions had been spent on the woman named Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now, Chairman Weiss seemed to have no feelings when mentioning Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because Chairman Weiss no longer loves Kyla?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But isn't that a little too soon? Can a person's feelings really change so fast in such a short time?' Mallory Malcom wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he called Kyla the next day to inform her of Chairman Weiss's decision, he could hear Kyla's disappointment on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? Did he really... say so?" muttered Kyla. Though she had speculated the possibility before, she still felt a pang in her heart the moment she heard it from Mallory Malcom's mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn, you know as well that Chairman Weiss is someone who stands by his word. Since Chairman Weiss has said so, don't waste your time. If you have anything you want to eat, do, or buy in L City, just let me know. I'll make the arrangements for you. Think of it as a trip," said Mallory Malcom.</p></div>
