        <h1>Chapter 3706</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was different from before, when the lock was an old-fashioned one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her password...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes and thought about it. In his memory, her mother's death anniversary was probably the password she used most often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he tried it, he found out it wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it wasn't for her mother's anniversary... He tried several times, including her birthday and even his own, but none of them worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at her sleeping form, trying to wake her up. "Wake up, we're at your place. Do you remember the password?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she slept, she snuggled closer to him, seeking some kind of comfort from the noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason furrowed his brow and asked again, "What's the password for your door?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pass...word..." she mumbled, and then in a half-awake state, she said a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes darkened suddenly, and after a while, he finally pressed the numbers on the lock and the door opened. He carried her inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was pitch black, but Mason turned on the light, and suddenly the room was filled with a bright, white light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything in the room was just like he remembered it from years ago, except for a small piece of furniture that had been replaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The small room, though old, was very clean. There were two rooms, one with a closed door and the other with a half-open door. In his memory, the latter was once her room, but after he joined the Barlow family, it became their room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason carried Veronica into the room and placed her on the bed. He didn't even notice that his movements were cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He silently watched her lying on the bed. The room was still dark, and moonlight shone through the window, falling on her peaceful and beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he have to intervene tonight? He could have ignored what would happen between her and that man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he saw that man about to grab her again, he didn't even think twice before pushing him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he couldn't stand those hands holding her so intimately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was wrong with him?! Mason shook his head and pushed away the doubts in his mind. He glanced at her shoes still on her feet, pursed his lips, bent down to take them off, and then pulled up the thin blanket to cover her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to straighten up, her body suddenly moved and one hand wrapped around his neck... "Don't... don't go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broken murmurs escaped from her mouth intermittently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body suddenly shook, his gaze sinking as he looked at the face so close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, she was the person he loved the most, but now, she was just an acquaintance to </span><span>him, without any significance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should push her away immediately and leave this place!</span></p></div>
