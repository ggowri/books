        <h1>Chapter 421</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, he would lie on the same bed with her inside the bedroom overnight. Even though the two did nothing in particular, it seemed that sleeping in the same space had become an unconscious habit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had to have the lights turned on to sleep, so she said euphemistically, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t seem to get used to me constantly turning on the lights to sleep. Perhaps you should go back to your room and sleep there.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Consequently, Jason replied, &ldquo;I want to sleep with you, Sis. I feel more comfortable sleeping with you. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me if the lights are on.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, Grace decided to keep the next few sentences to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the words Jason had uttered were... somewhat coquettish! Did he not know that such words were capable of causing inappropriate reveries?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Are you going to sleep?&rdquo; Jason asked as he watched Grace walk toward the bed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Grace responded with a flustered face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lifted the quilt and got on the bed. Jason&rsquo;s arms were readily wrapped around her waist as he hugged her tightly. He buried his face into her chest as if he was a child, acting spoiled around an adult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The current him seemed slightly childish, and he was not the same as usual. Nevertheless, Li Grace inexplicably fancied Jason&rsquo;s childishness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;By the way, what did Brian say to you today? Were you guys arguing?&rdquo; Grace suddenly thought of the matter. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Which sentence?&rdquo; Jason asked; he felt that holding her in such a manner was really addictive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once he attached himself to her, it was hard for him to let go. He wanted to keep on doing so and become surrounded by her air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;When he said that he didn&rsquo;t want to be your enemy,&rdquo; Grace continued. After all, she remembered that Brian had a good relationship with Jason; those words would have made one feel like they were rivals instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suppose the Hart family and the Reed family were really enemies. In that case, Grace could already see the financial and film circles in Emerald City experiencing a crisis. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;He meant it literally,&rdquo; Jason responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But, there&rsquo;s always a reason for such things.&rdquo; Grace curiously asked, &ldquo;Are you two competing for a business deal?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re competing for you,&rdquo; Jason retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost choked on her saliva. They were competing for her? That could not be it! He had to be joking, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason slowly lifted his head and gazed into her eyes. As usual, his dark pupils seemed to blend in with the endless night. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s interested in you and wants to steal you away. So, I told him that if he actually dares to make a move, I&rsquo;ll make him an enemy of mine. When that time comes, I will not hesitate to tear him apart.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason in a dazed manner as if a stormy sea had been set off inside her heart. &ldquo;Are you really&hellip; going to do that to Brian?&rdquo; Grace asked naively because she knew very well what the price he would have to pay was a fall-out occurred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you before. I love you. You&rsquo;re as important to me as my own life, did you think I was joking when I said that?&rdquo; Jason asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lips with her teeth, and her vivid, almond-shaped eyes widened at this moment. It was as if she had been put in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she was unaware of was that the expression she was wearing on her face was enough to make one&rsquo;s heart skip a few beats. Not to mention, give one the urge to possess all of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was when Jason&rsquo;s finger gently stroked her lips.</p></div>
