        <h1>Chapter 457</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Hadwin saw Lina's twinkling eyes, his mood inexplicably turned sour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car drove back to Emerald City, it arrived at Reed Residence first. Jason and Grace got out of the car while Hadwin went to the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"See you next time, Grace," said Lina as she bid Grace goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Grace. "Thank you for today, and be careful on your way back!" With that, she and Jason walked through the large iron gates of Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina kept her eyes fixed on Jason and Grace who were now behind the iron gates. Then, she heard Hadwin's impatient voice. "Haven't you seen enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just looking, that's all," muttered Lina. When she met Jason at Grace's rental house previously, although she did not perceive him as a hobo, she never thought of him as the local tyrant of Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, a pair of hands grabbed Lina's face. Her face was turned to face his. "Didn't you say you liked looking at my face the other day? Are you now interested in Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina almost choked. What was he saying? Why did he think that she was interested in Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was just marveling at the fact that Grace actually got together with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, considering her relationship with Hadwin now, he was now her &lsquo;creditor&rsquo;. She dared not refute and anger him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Lina smiled rather lamely and said, "What? Why would I be interested in Jason? I was just... blessing Grace in my heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" His face closed in on her as if trying to see what she was really thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course!" She quickly guaranteed, trying hard to fill her eyes with innocence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's best if that really is the case. Don't forget whose girlfriend you are," said Hadwin. His serious gaze seemed like a warning, but there was also some helplessness in the depths of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she had not forgotten! Lina rolled her eyes. The status of being his girlfriend was like an incarceration curse, telling her that she was now paying her debts. She had to fall in love with him and suffer his revenge!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... looking at the handsome face close at hand, Lina had to admit that Hadwin's face was indeed very nice to look at and pleasing to the eye!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did not know how it would end and if it was a real relationship, then maybe she would have really fallen for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I won't forget that I'm your girlfriend. Don't worry, I promise I won't fall in love with anyone else before I fall in love with you," replied Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She intentionally stressed the word &lsquo;love&rsquo;. She would fall in 'love' with him when the time was right and let him take his revenge. Then, she would have probably repaid her debt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin glared at Lina. She had repeated the rules he told her at first, but hearing it from her made him feel uncomfortable. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she would not fall in love with anyone else before falling in love with him... Did that mean that after falling in love with him, she would fall in love with someone else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart ached at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you dare fall in love with someone else, Lina,&rdquo; he said as he glared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instinctively tried to retort, but when she met his menacing gaze, she touched her nose and shut her mouth.</p></div>
