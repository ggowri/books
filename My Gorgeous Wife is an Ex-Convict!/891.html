        <h1>Chapter 890</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this method was effective on Lina. She slightly loosened her fingers that were clutching the vest, but she looked reluctant. "Hadwin... Are&hellip; Are you that mean that you won't even let me keep a vest?" she spoke with difficulty. Her drunken eyes were full of grievances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you say I&rsquo;m more charming? Then why keep another man's vest?" He snapped, forgetting that he was arguing with a drunk woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They... can dance. You can't..." she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was so furious that he said, "How do you know I can't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then dance... Um... Dance... and take your clothes off..." she added at the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. "If I dance for you, will you stop thinking about other men?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes... I swear!" She nodded her little head with some force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, mark your words. If you dare back out..." He paused. "I won't give you a chance to back out anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Hadwin raised his hands and unbuttoned his clothes in front of Lina&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was slowly swaying. Such performances were not unheard of abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was easy for him to dance, and he could dance better than those men. As long as she could keep her eyes on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Didn't she tell me she loves me? However, why do I feel like I can't hold on to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I want her to love me with all her heart and to love me so much that she won&rsquo;t care about other men.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took off his clothes one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina finally let go of the vest. Her drunken eyes just stared at the man in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So beautiful... He's so beautiful&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What do I do... I... I want him. I want to hold him. I want to touch him and... throw myself at him!' Lina thought about it and actually did it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her drunken body staggered to her feet, then she threw herself at Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She threw herself at him, not in the manner of throwing herself into his arms, but like a hungry tiger pouncing on its food!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin had expected it. However, he still stumbled when she threw herself at him. She then leaned over to the other side before she could regain her footing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Danger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that she was about to fall to the ground, he used his body to cushion her without much thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two heavy thuds were heard. Hadwin had fallen onto the carpet in the living room while Lina fell onto Hadwin's body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Thank God. She probably didn't hurt much from the fall.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin thought as a pair of hands touched his abdomen. "You have... abs..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was rendered speechless. 'Is this the time to care about my abs? Besides, if she keeps on groping me like this, then I&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Hadwin tried to rip Lina off him, the servant came in with the soup. She was instantly petrified when she saw what was going on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... What's going on here? Miss Sweeney threw herself onto Young Master Stephenson with a needy look on her face. It almost looks as if she was going to... Uh&hellip; Have her way with him.'</p></div>
