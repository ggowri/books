        <h1>Chapter 425</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but think, &lsquo;Was she really that important in his heart? They had only known each other for six short months now; could his feelings for her really be that deep?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it seemed like Jason had no reason to lie to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had nothing to offer, so there was no use in deceiving her, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Would it be okay, Sis?&rdquo; Jason had a magnetic voice that carried an unignorable desire as he asked the same question the third time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then&hellip; I&rsquo;ll cook more when I have the time.&rdquo; Grace returned to her senses and felt that her heart was beating intensely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jason chuckled lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurriedly lowered her head and cleaned up the lunch boxes on the table. However, just when she was about to close their lids, she hissed out and subconsciously pulled her fingers back. She heaved out a pained breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Jason asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s just my nail. I chipped it accidentally. I&rsquo;ll trim it when I get back,&rdquo; Grace replied. Although she usually trimmed her nails often, the priority for her to do so had diminished the past few days. Hence, her nails were slightly longer than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Let me have a look at it,&rdquo; Jason said as he pulled her hand closer. He carefully looked at her nail that had been slightly chipped earlier. &ldquo;Is this the one?&rdquo; Jason gently held the index finger of Grace&rsquo;s left hand and noticed that the edge of the nail was slightly cracked. It should be fine after some trimming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Grace nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Wait for a while,&rdquo; Jason said. Then, he picked up his cell phone and dialed the secretary&rsquo;s number. &ldquo;Do you have a nail clipper there?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace heard this and almost choked on her saliva.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other one who was almost choked on her saliva was the secretary who answered the phone. She had not expected the president to call her and ask her for&mdash;&mdash; nail clippers?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was the president planning on trimming his nails? The secretary was confused and baffled. Nevertheless, she took her pair of nail clippers to the president&rsquo;s office. That was when she noticed Grace sitting on the sofa with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Young Master Reed, here are the nail clippers you wanted.&rdquo; The secretary respectfully handed it over to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Alright, you may leave now.&rdquo; Jason said as he took the nail clippers from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary then quietly exited the president&rsquo;s room. However, when she was about to close the door to the office, she heard the president say in an extremely gentle tone, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This voice&hellip; and that tone&hellip; the person who is speaking&hellip; Is that Young Master Reed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary could not help but look in the direction of her boss. What she saw next was the president &mdash;&mdash; carefully trimming Grace&rsquo;s nails.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was right. Young Master Reed was trimming a woman&rsquo;s nails. The expression on his face was just as gentle as the tone he had used earlier; it was akin to calm water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary had worked in the company for several years, yet she had never seen such a gentle side of the president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were rumors in the company that this woman often came to the company to deliver food. It was very likely that she was the president&rsquo;s new girlfriend. Nonetheless, she had always thought that it was impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if she were his new girlfriend, why would the president let his girlfriend deliver food to him every day?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the scene made her feel that the rumor was perhaps true. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Furthermore, judging from their level of intimacy, she could not just be his girlfriend; they were probably lovers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary left in a perplexed manner, while Grace, whose nails were getting trimmed, tried to guide Jason through the process, &ldquo;Hey, not too deep but not too far out either. A little deeper in and don&rsquo;t forget the side&hellip; Yeah, cut a little bit more there&hellip;&rdquo;</p></div>
