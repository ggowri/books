        <h1>Chapter 495</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was dumbfounded for a moment before responding. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t compare it like that.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One was the love of her life and the other was her best friend. These were two completely different kinds of relationships!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On further thought, she said, &ldquo;Both of you are people I can sacrifice my life for! So both of you are equally important to me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze shifted. He should feel satisfied that she was willing to use her life to protect him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;But why can&rsquo;t it be me only?!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bottom line was, he was being too greedy. He was so greedy that he wanted to be the one and only person in the center of her heart. He was so greedy that he did not want anyone else to occupy an important role to her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Because she helped you back then?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I guess so. In the beginning, I didn&rsquo;t know that she would do so much for me even though we&rsquo;re friends.&rdquo; Grace sighed. Back then, her friendship with Lina was quite good, but sometimes you need to weather through a storm together before you could find the gem or trash in that person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only after going through some ordeals could you see a person clearly and understand that some people were worth your genuine heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Without Lina, there won&rsquo;t be me now. That&rsquo;s why Lina is so important to me.&rdquo; Grace then looked at Jason and touched his cheeks. &ldquo;Are you jealous of Lina as well?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If I said I am?&rdquo; he asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback and inexplicably felt that Jason was like a child right now. In the past, she had heard a saying that there was a child hidden in every man regardless of how mature and responsible he may seem. It seemed to be the case right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll just have to bear with it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pulled her hand over and placed it on his lips. They gently touched her palm, causing her to blush again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I guess I have to,&rdquo; he mumbled and closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was not for the road accident back then, perhaps Lina would not be that important to her. However, just as Grace said, if it was not for Lina, there would not be Grace now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he should be grateful toward Lina. When Grace was at her lowest point, it was Lina who supported her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, he would not have been able to meet the current Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But the most important man in your life can only be me.&rdquo; He gave in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was always the one who gave in when it came to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back at the housing estate, Lina and Hadwin were still staring at each other. &ldquo;What did Jason mean? What happened?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was uncomfortable with the fact that he needed to find out about his girlfriend&rsquo;s problems through another person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a small matter.&rdquo; Lina sheepishly smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Hadwin heard it, he immediately gave her two options to choose from. &ldquo;Are you going to tell me the full story or shall I investigate it myself? You pick one out of the two options.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina&rsquo;s expression fell. That meant that she was supposed to confess it herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was worried that if he investigated this matter, he would find out more about her than this issue alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay, okay. I&rsquo;ll talk.&rdquo; Lina gave up on being resistant. She then narrated everything to Hadwin.</p></div>
