        <h1>Chapter 788</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least now she had a lawyer's license, so she could go back to doing the job she loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll go with you. I drove here today, so it's more convenient," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pair went to a real estate agent. Since Grace did not have high requirements for the house she wanted to rent, it did not take her long to find a suitable one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They went to see the house in the morning and signed the rental agreement with the landlord in the afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It cost 1,700 dollars a month. The transportation was also relatively convenient, and there was also a supermarket and eateries nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina found the people in the neighborhood a little complicated and worried that her friend would run into safety issues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">About that, Grace said, "It's not like I'm going to live here for the rest of my life. It's just a temporary transition until I have a more stable income. Then, I'll find somewhere else. Besides, I'll go out as little as possible at night. I'll be alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina thought about it. 'It'll have to do for the time being.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, Lina drove again to help Grace move in. They bought some necessary cookware and cleaned up the rental house. Finally, after much work, they were almost there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Lina left, she said, "If you need anything, just call me. Don't be shy and don't take care of everything yourself, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," replied Grace. When Lina was about to step out of the house, she could not help but rush forward and hug Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Lina was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, I'm glad I have you," murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it&rsquo;s not for Lina, maybe I would&rsquo;ve broken down at that bus stop yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Every time I find myself in a desperate situation, it&rsquo;s Lina who appears by my side!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It&rsquo;s Lina who pulls me out of the abyss again and again.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina patted her best friend gently. "I told you we're gonna be friends forever, so no matter what happens, you should always remember that you have me by your side!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Grace with a slightly heavy nasal sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I owe Lina too much. As long as Lina needs me, I'll use all I have to repay Lina's kindness!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing Lina off, Grace looked around at the rented house that was about the same size as her previous one, only with an extra separate kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One bedroom, one living room, one kitchen, and one bathroom. 1,700 dollars was a bargain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now I'm back to being alone again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'There's nothing different!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Just think of this time with Jason as a dream&mdash;an absurd and flashy dream. After I wake up, I'm still me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got out of her rental house and took the bus, heading to Kyla's small restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not let Kyla and Nelson come over yesterday and only said a few words on the phone. 'Maybe Kyla is still worried. I don't know if Nelson was disappointed.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She heard from Kyla that Nelson had gone to great lengths to help her choose a birthday present!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she thought of Nelson, Grace's heart burst with pity. When she looked at Nelson, she could not help feeling the surge of maternal love. She even thought that it would be great if she could give birth to a child as smart, intelligent, and adorable as Nelson.</p></div>
