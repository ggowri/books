        <h1>Chapter 3045</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda turned to look at Brian, but noticed a hint of suspicion in his furrowed brow and eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Clearly, Brian had also guessed something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Barlow family should have surveillance, right? Send me the footage of the woman I was with," Brian said to Jason after they got off the boat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked up. "Do you have an idea?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to know if it's the person I know!" Brian said, his eyes flashing with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was her, then Whitney deserved to be punished!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason called Philip and soon received a clip of the woman's surveillance footage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian and Valda watched the video and quickly recognized the person in it - it was indeed Whitney!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It really is her!" Brian gritted his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who is she?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I saved a woman while I was abroad. She came to Emerald City recently, but I sent her back abroad not long ago. I just didn't expect her to do something like this!" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, he only regrets being kind to Whitney before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he hadn't saved Whitney abroad in the first place, this wouldn't have happened now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper and Mick are very worried about their sister, especially Jasper who is almost in tears. They are asking their sister directly if she has been kidnapped and if they will ever see her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Daddy will definitely find your little sister!" Jason comforted his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Jasper said with red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Seriously, when has Dad ever lied to you?" Jason said. If the other person dared to have any ideas about his daughter, they could forget about living peacefully for the rest of their life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although William didn't feel much towards the little baby, he still felt a sense of sadness when he looked at Jasper's red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I will also help you find your sister," William said to Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can do it too!" said Simon. "My dad knows a lot of people, I'll ask him to help us find it together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time the group returned to the Barlow family, there were already many police officers present. The servants who had contact with Whitney were also lined up and being questioned by the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When William saw Jason and Grace, he looked guilty and said, "I'm sorry, I never thought something like this would happen! Don't worry, as long as they haven't left Deer Capital, even if I have to turn the whole place upside down, I will find Jasmine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace is currently forcing herself to hold her body up, and if it weren't for the children present, she would probably have already burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But because she was afraid that her emotions would make the children more anxious, she almost exhausted all her strength to restrain her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Four children were taken to a room on the second floor and looked after by the servants, while the adults stayed in the hall on the first floor and continued to cooperate with the police, trying to figure out how to find Jasmine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Until this moment, the tears that Grace had been holding back finally surged out of her eyes.</p></div>
