        <h1>Chapter 2018</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The grand birthday party brought together Emerald City's top elites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Ordinary people like the He family were only able to attend this party because of Mason, or more specifically, Veronica Barlow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It would be strange if only Veronica Barlow came, so the He family was also invited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the splendid party in front of her and the upper-class people whom she could only see on TV before this, it would be a lie if Rosalind Bush said she was not shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although she had thought about what to expect since the party was frequently reported on the news, she was still shocked when she arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is this what it means to be a rich family?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Only by holding on to Mason could her family enter high society and get more benefits so that her own son could become rich in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that in mind, Rosalind Bush smiled as she took her stepdaughter's hand and said, "Come on, Veronica. Let's go and greet Mason's parents. They invited us to this party today. We should also wish the triplets a happy birthday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She also gave her husband a look as she spoke. With a good luck charm like Veronica Barlow around, they were still related to the Reed family even though Jason and Grace often ignored them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As long as the upper class there saw that they were related to the Reed family, it would greatly benefit their future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah. Come on, Veronica. Take your brother's hand. We'll go see Mason and say hello to his parents," Archer Barlow said after receiving the hint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Veronica Barlow looked at everything before her in a trance. She seemed to be stuck in a trance, not hearing what her father and stepmother were saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had always thought of Mason as her younger brother, someone she had to take care of and protect. If she did not take care of Mason, then Mason would be too pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, for the first time, she felt so distinctly that Mason was no longer the pitiful brother she thought but what the grown-ups called the young master of a rich family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even without her care and protection, Mason could live a good life. He had his daddy, mommy, and so many servants. Many people she had only seen on TV came to celebrate Mason's birthday today. It was something she could not imagine but was happening in reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Veronica Barlow followed her parents to Jason and Grace, the distinct feeling intensified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She watched her father and stepmother give all sorts of compliments. Mason was dressed up just like the young master of the super-rich family she saw in TV shows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wore a crisp small suit with a small bow tie. His leather shoes were shiny, and his black hair was combed neatly, making his beautiful face look even better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, this Mason felt unfamiliar to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not until he looked at her with his dark eyes, came to her side, grasped her hand tightly, and called her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; that Veronica Barlow regained her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Mason... is still Mason, my baby brother! Even if Mason is the young master of the Reed family, even if he will one day leave the He family and return to the Reed family and... might no longer need my care and protection, I still hope he can always be my &lsquo;brother&rsquo;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Happy birthday, Mason!" Veronica Barlow said with twinkling eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The corners of the lips on Mason's expressionless little face raised, and a smile appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although the smile was faint and not obvious, it meant he was happy!</p></div>
