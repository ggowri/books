        <h1>Chapter 137</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Noooo..." she screamed. She struggled against him arduously and yet no matter how much she wrestled, it was useless against him. Her face was flushed red and the skin under the open hospital gown was suddenly exposed to the cold air, causing goosebumps to appear. "Let go of me! Let go of me!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt panicked and frustrated.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And yet, his manner was composed. His long fingers pressed against her wrists and with a smile, he said, "Sister, you can shout a little louder. There are bodyguards, nurses, and doctors on shift out there. They might be able to hear your screams but..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He paused and studied her with a burning gaze. "I can assure you, no one will come in and save you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's body froze. "I know he's telling the truth. Even if I scream until my throat is sore, no one would dare to enter this ward.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Because this man... is Jason!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She remained silent while he leaned forward, his lips pressing against her jaw, neck, and finally, he paused at her pretty collarbone, sprinkling tiny kisses on it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Stay by my side. Didn't you say that on this earth, I care for you and you'll care for me too? I'm giving you the opportunity to do so now but why don't you want it?" he mumbled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt as if her heart had been pierced.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I did say that once but hearing those words now feels like such a huge mockery."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Because you're not Jay." She thought to herself, "He's not the homeless person I thought who was a fellow sufferer. He's Jason, the man capable of changing the weather in Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He paused and propped himself up slightly. He studied her and said, "I am. If you want me to, then I can be like the way I was then. I can act in a manner you like in front of you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled wryly. "Even if you acted that way, you're not Jay."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"My Jay doesn't exist anymore. He was a hallucination from start to end."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He pursed his thin lips tightly and coldness bloomed within his beautiful and amorous eyes. A few moments passed before he replied, "Are you so repulsed by &lsquo;Jason&rsquo;? But Sister, have you ever thought just because I am Jason, I'm the only one in Emerald City capable of turning you into a person of note, giving you a chance to escape your current fate? If not, who would be willing to offend &lsquo;Jason&rsquo; for your sake?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He straightened himself and after giving her a haughty glance, he left the room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did Grace sit up and fasten the buttons of her hospital gown one at a time. She then used the covers to tightly wrap her trembling body.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"He didn't really want me just now. He just wanted to show me that as long as he does, I won't be able to object to him!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can't even refuse him!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence relayed the investigation results to Jason. "On that day, Lina met with some people she usually spends time with, her family, colleagues, and neighbors. But there was an exception, Zoe."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sean's sister?" Jason asked as he muttered to himself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes. From what I heard from Lina's colleagues, during the fight between Zoe and Lina, Zoe mentioned your name, Mr. Reed," Terrence continued.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason smiled coldly. "It didn't occur to me that the slip-up was caused by Zoe Stevens."</p></div>
