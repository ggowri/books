        <h1>Chapter 806</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This man is really your nemesis. You get seriously injured like this whenever he shows up! What on earth is going on? Did you really stab yourself like he said?" Mrs. Corbyn said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, Mom, I did it myself.&rdquo; Kyla admitted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He wants me to give him a baby. It's funny that he did that to me back then, and now he wants to get revenge by asking me to give him a child," Kyla said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it possible that he still has feelings for you? After all, both of you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom!" Kyla interrupted her mother's unrealistic fantasy. "He wants me to give him a baby because Paisley Daniels is unable to conceive. He's just using me as a tool. If he has feelings for me, he wouldn&rsquo;t have put me in prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing that, a flash of sadness came over Mrs. Corbyn's face. "We had it coming. It&rsquo;s because you had to bear the consequences of your father's wrongdoings! How could Martin Weiss treat you like this? You even&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, stop." Kyla stopped her mother from continuing. Everything in the past was like a nightmare to her, a nightmare she was trying to forget. "If you&rsquo;re here at the hospital, what about Nelson? What did you do with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked the landlord to take care of him. I didn't bring him to the hospital because I was scared that Martin Weiss would see him! But now that Martin Weiss's gone, why don't I bring Nelson here? I can also take care of you," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I... I can just get a nurse in the hospital to take care of me. The food here is ready-made anyway. Don't bring Nelson to the hospital, and don't tell him about me being hospitalized for an injury," said Kyla. She could not risk any chance of her son being discovered by Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But your injury..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, I'll survive. I'm gonna provide for you and grow old with Nelson by my side!" said Kyla as she tried hard to smile, not wanting her mother to worry too much about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mother had suffered enough for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her smile made Mrs. Corbyn sadder. A mother knew their daughter best. How could she not know what her daughter was thinking about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the doctor and nurse came. Kyla learned of her injuries. Although her stomach was injured, it did not affect her uterus much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the cost of her operation, Martin Weiss had paid it in advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You got lucky this time. If it was two centimeters deeper, you probably won&rsquo;t be able to keep your uterus!" said the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla gave a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I actually don&rsquo;t want to keep my womb...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I can let Martin Weiss take his revenge on me in other ways. I can endure it all for Nelson! But... I don't want to give him another child no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What did children mean to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does Nelson mean to him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Mrs. Corbyn left the hospital and Kyla lay alone in the large ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss actually got her a VIP ward, which surprised her a little. 'This time... he's gone. He's really gone. Did he leave my world? Or will he come back again one day?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I once hoped that even in hell, we'd never meet again! I wish I could cut him off completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now it seems that it was only wishful thinking after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe he'll get back at me again someday. Maybe Emerald City is not a good place for me to stay in any longer&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
