        <h1>Chapter 4191 How Wonderful It Is to Fall in Love with You</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When Kit finished singing a song, Tina was still a bit lost in the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A strange feeling was stirring in her heart, instinctively telling her that she really liked his singing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's really beautiful!" she praised, and when he was singing, it was as if he was radiating light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If he were to sing on stage, he would surely be even more dazzling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Is this the person she likes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It seems natural to start liking someone after liking their songs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If you like listening to it, I can sing it to you every day," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Really?" Tina's face brightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, really," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> For him, being able to sing to her every day was a blessing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But you sing so well, why did you say you used to be a singer, aren't you anymore?" Tina asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A faint bitter smile crossed Kit's face. "Well, no, I have already quit the entertainment industry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why?" she asked, without disappointment or sadness, just pure curiosity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Because, for me, the entertainment industry is not really suitable. Sometimes you need to do whatever it takes to get resources in order to advance your career. If you can't get resources, then you have nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Before, he didn't think much of it and was even willing to accept some dirty conditions to get resources.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But after meeting her, he gradually changed. Sometimes, in front of her, he would feel a sense of shame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Perhaps it was because she was too clean, too pure, that it made his own dirtiness more apparent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It made him hesitant to get close to her, fearing that his impurity would taint her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I see..." Tina murmured. "But I think it's a pity that you're not a singer anymore. And with your good looks, I'm sure many people would love you if you act."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I don't care if other people like me or not, as long as you're willing to like me, that's enough," Kit said. "As for not being a singer anymore... but if you want to hear me sing, I can sing for you anytime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> His tenderness made Tina's mind wander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Everything in front of her felt like a dream. Not long ago, she was desperately trying to escape from that village, worried about the safety of her unborn child, even thinking of the worst outcome, that she and the child might die together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But now, she could relax here and listen to all of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In this moment, her heart was filled with gratitude towards Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although she didn't have deep feelings for the person in front of her right now, since she used to love him and even carried his child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Then in the future, she will surely fall in love with him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Besides, he is such a good person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's wrong?" Tina looked at his absentminded gaze, prompting Kit to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina smiled, "I just think it's great that the person I fell in love with is you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, after hearing her words, he suddenly stiffened and asked, "Do you really think... that it's a good thing for you to fall in love with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Hmm," she nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A wave of guilt surged within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If she were to learn the truth in the future, she probably wouldn't smile at him like she does now, or say such words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "By the way, what are my parents like?" Tina suddenly asked.</p></div>
