        <h1>Chapter 3453</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Daniel and Veronica arrived at the Cross family's house, they saw Archer and Rosalind shouting and cursing at the people of the Cross family in the living room. The words they used were all very offensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They are saying that the Cross family intentionally flirted with the daughter of the Barlow family. They are also accusing the Cross family of using unethical methods and are threatening to take them to court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, the Cross family must make their son break up, otherwise this matter will not be resolved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's parents were extremely angry. As soon as they saw their son come back, they immediately said to him, "Look at you, what kind of girlfriend did you date? Since she asked you to break up, then break up. Don't cause trouble for the family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel looked at Veronica's parents and tried to control himself as he said, "Hello, Uncle and Aunt. My name is Daniel, and Veronica and I are currently dating. However, we will not do anything inappropriate and will focus on our studies. Our relationship will not affect our academic performance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, these words had no effect on Archer and Rosalind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't talk about all these things, anyway, we don't agree with you two being together!" said Archer. "Break up, break up right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, enough! Why are you forcing me to break up? Ask yourselves honestly, are you really doing this for my own good or for your own selfish reasons?" Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you talking about?" Archer said irritably. "Just because of this guy, you and Mason have a rift, and now Mason won't return to the Barlow family. Are you happy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am dating Daniel, it has nothing to do with Mason. Please don't confuse the two," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean it's not a big deal? Mason has been staying with our family for so many years. If you want to become the Reed family's Mason grandma in the future, it will be an easy thing to do!" Archer blurted out his wishful thinking that he had been planning for so many years in a moment of urgency.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked embarrassed and said, "Mason is my younger brother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not even related by blood!" said Archer, then he turned to Daniel and warned him, "Don't even think about aiming too high, you're punching above your weight. Look at yourself, you're not even close to being good enough for my daughter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Daniel initially wanted to show respect towards Archer, his expression turned extremely unpleasant at this moment. If Archer wasn't Veronica's father, he might have impulsively thrown a punch already.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Cross pulled herself over and looked coldly at the Barlow family. "Swan, what kind of swan is your daughter? If you continue to insult people like this, I will call the police!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go ahead, call the police if you dare!" Archer said angrily, even shaking his fist at the old Mrs. Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel was afraid that Archer might actually hit his own mother, so he quickly stepped forward and grabbed Archer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, when Rosalind saw what was happening, she thought her husband was going to be hit, so she reached out and hit Archer. Then, the elderly Mrs. Cross also joined the fight. After that, the elderly Mr. Cross and Archer also started fighting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On site, everything suddenly became chaotic, and soon after, a group of people were taken to the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica never imagined that her relationship would lead to both sides being taken to the police station. All she did was fall in love with someone, so why did things end up like this?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And, with all the trouble in their family today, can she and Daniel really continue their relationship?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the police station, the two families have been temporarily separated and are undergoing separate mediation sessions.</p></div>
