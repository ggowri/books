        <h1>Chapter 767</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry?" He laughed in anger. What she did to him was more than worry him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she know how panicked he was when Brian appeared in front of him with her on his back? It was as if his feet could hardly support his weight to keep standing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she know how he felt when she was whispering to Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian put her down, she thanked Brian and smiled at him, and what his father once said to him rang in his ear. "Jason, if one day your joys and sorrows are all in the hands of another person, then your life will be so hard... Very hard..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Hard?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's pretty hard.' He felt nothing but bitterness in his mouth. 'I want to imprison her somewhere only I can go so that she can go nowhere and see no one but me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I want her to smile only at me and not at any other man!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's jealousy!' He was jealous of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw her and Brian appear in front of his eyes like that, he only felt as if they had their own time and space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It felt as if others couldn&rsquo;t get in!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I... I was one of the others!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, Brian was walking down the hill. When he saw the police and barricades that had not been removed, the corners of his mouth could not help raising slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It seems Jason does care about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Then again, I've known Jason for 20 years, but have I ever seen that guy treat a woman this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jennifer Atkinson didn&rsquo;t even get to enjoy half of Jason's gentleness!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian!" A voice rang hurriedly. Stella Lindsay had already rushed to Brian's side. "Are you alright? I saw that you haven't returned to the Lu family's house, and I heard that someone seemed to have got lost here, so I hurriedly came over to have a look!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In fact, what she was really afraid of was that he would run into Grace. After all, Grandma's grave was in this area too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine," Brian said lightly, looking at the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay was dressed in a black dress and had on delicate makeup as well as expensive jewelry. If it was not the 49th day after her grandmother's death today, she would make herself look even more eye-catching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way she looked at him right now showed her concern, but it was done in a more ingratiating manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had seen many women like this. Many women in the entertainment industry wanted to climb up the social ladder through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those women disguised their intentions better than Stella Lindsay and were smarter than Stella Lindsay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay looked around Brian and did not see Grace, so she felt a little more relieved. Then, she said with a shy expression on her face, "Brian, my parents want to invite you to dinner tonight. They want to thank you for helping me so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks," Brian said lightly as he rejected her. "It's getting late and I have to hurry back to Emerald City. Let's talk about it next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Stella Lindsay was unwilling to let Brian leave! She and her parents were going to insinuate to him that she had been thinking of him all these years to increase his affection for her.</p></div>
