        <h1>Chapter 1475</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But even so, you're still the Atkinson family's second heiress. It wasn&rsquo;t like you weren&rsquo;t going to get anything. You'd still have gotten whatever your parents would&rsquo;ve given you!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the point of getting so little?" Lily said with a cold snort, "If my sister were still alive and I were just the Atkinson family's second heiress, your parents probably wouldn&rsquo;t value me as much and would want you to be more cautious when dating me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's face immediately turned red. He knew Lily was right. His parents had only chosen her because she would succeed the Atkinson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But Grace was innocent. Why did you treat her like that in prison when you had already framed her?" asked Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean shuddered as he thought about how Lily had treated Grace back then and how she was the real murderer. How many more performances had this woman put on before him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"She was your girlfriend. Only by getting rid of her would I stand a chance to be your girlfriend!" Lily suddenly smiled mockingly. "I just wanted to see how much Grace mattered to you, but... Haha... It turned out she meant nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a pause, Lily said, "Sean, you could kick Grace aside for the Stevens family when she was your girlfriend. What about me? Are you going to kick me aside for the Stevens family too? Or would you do anything to help me because you love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily stared at Sean with a look of tension and anticipation in her somewhat beautiful eyes when she said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">To her disappointment, Sean was silent and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the silence was enough to make Lily understand something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Haha! Sean, you're the same as before!" Lily laughed bitterly, her eyes full of intense hatred. "Why did I fall in love with a bastard like you? You're just cruel and heartless. The Stevens family benefited so much from you dating me! But now, you're going to kick me aside?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's enough!" Sean shouted with a look of embarrassment. "The Stevens family doesn't owe you anything. You deserve it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily laughed until tears escaped her eyes. Finally, she stared bitterly at Sean and said, "Sean, if I deserve this, then what about you? Are you innocent? With the way you treated Grace before this, do you think the Stevens family will end well? I'm waiting for the Stevens family to go down and for you to turn from a rich heir into a penniless man! I&rsquo;d like to see who&rsquo;d fall in love with you then!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's face instantly turned grim!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now that the Atkinson family was in such a mess, the Stevens family&rsquo;s fate would probably not be any better!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace needed to go for a maternity check-up today. This time, she was accompanied by a bodyguard and not Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace went to the doctor's consulting room from the ultrasound room after her maternity check-up. Her bodyguard accompanied her into the doctor's consulting room, but the doctor she usually consulted with was not there. The seat was empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned for a moment. Before she could react, she only heard her bodyguard, Huang Qian, giving a warning. Then, Huang Qian was quickly subdued by two men while Brian appeared from the corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Surprise flashed across Grace's face, and she stared at Brian. "How did you..."</p></div>
