        <h1>Chapter 2518</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been wondering what kind of person they were. Who knew it was her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she did not donate, he could have found plenty of other donors... Why her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have no regrets. I want to save the child. So what if he&rsquo;s your and Louise Mitchell's child? Grown-ups' affairs are between grown-ups. The child has nothing to do with us," Amber Mitchell said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nothing to do?' George Gregory suddenly felt a sense of irony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea he married Louise Mitchell because of the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you gave me this red envelope, I'll return it to you. I donated blood to those in need. I don't need a red envelope." With that said, Amber Mitchell handed him the red envelope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory did not take it. He looked at Amber Mitchell's face. "I won't take back what I've given away. If you don't want to accept the red envelope, you can throw it away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell pressed her red lips together, turned around without saying a word, and took the red envelope to the nurses' station, saying, "Mr. George Gregory is donating this sum to the hospital. Take it." With that said, she put the red envelope on the counter of the nurses' station and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory watched Amber Mitchell coldly as she walked past him on her way to the elevator. Suddenly, he grabbed her arm and said coldly, "I'm going to ask you one last time. Do you really want to make an enemy out of me? Once you become my opponent, you&rsquo;ll have nothing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell jerked back her arm with a faint smile. "I already have nothing, so I have nothing to lose. In that case, what do I have to be afraid of?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Amber Mitchell walked into the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elevator door closed slowly, leaving George Gregory staring at the closed elevator door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was quite a while before he returned to the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A six or seven-year-old boy lay in the hospital bed. He was pale and wearing an oxygen mask. There was a needle in his arm to transfuse the blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The last bag of blood was Amber Mitchell's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory stared blankly at the blood bag hanging in front of him, not expecting Amber Mitchell's blood to be transfused into his son's body one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Louise Mitchell's blood was the one that could save Simon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, Simon's condition would only become more critical if it went on like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory quietly sat beside the hospital bed, watching his son struggle for his life. His eyes were filled with a rare look of apology.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell originally wanted to meet Stan Lucas, Sandra Lucas's younger brother. He might be the key to determining Louise Mitchell's role in the accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she hesitated again when she came to his ward and saw the sweet family there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the old case was brought up, Stan Lucas's fortune would be illicit and it would be confiscated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would Stan Lucas be willing to let that happen?</p></div>
