        <h1>Chapter 241</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's face suddenly went stiff, but it was not a time for her to throw a fit. She could only smile, take out her purse, and ask Grace, "How much is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's 106 dollars," Grace replied directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn took out 200 dollars and pretended to be generous as she said, "Sis can keep the rest. Consider it a gift."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace scoffed and took the money. "It's not a gift. It's that I'm kind enough to only charge you this much. Otherwise, if I were to sue you for harming with intent, how much do you think you&rsquo;ll owe me then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's face was very red, but luckily she was covered with a mask, so no one could see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost forgot that Grace used to be a lawyer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can I hurt you on purpose?" Evelyn said, smiling sheepishly. "It was careless of me that day." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it really necessary for you to act like this before me, Evelyn?" Grace looked at her with amusement. "You and I both know exactly what kind of person you are, and there's no one else around here. It's just making you look like a clown by calling me &lsquo;sis&rsquo; and saying you were careless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn almost choked, and her face went dark. "Well then, tell me about your relationship with Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess that's what you're here for today." Grace looked coldly at her and said, "Is it necessary to tell you what's my relationship with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian is my boyfriend now. You better not try to seduce him. Otherwise, your reputation will be ruined, and you'll get nothing!" Evelyn said sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A ruined reputation? Grace only found her half-sister's words extremely funny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her reputation had already been ruined by the accident three years before. "What am I going to get now?" She made a sarcastic remark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn raised her chin. "If you know your place, then I might give you some money to run a small business in the future. It&rsquo;s better than sweeping the road here, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyway, if she did become Mrs. Hart, then having a sister working as a sanitation service worker did not sound great.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was quite willing to let Grace go down the drain as much as possible. However, for the sake of maintaining her image in the future, it seemed best to let Grace own a small business. She could even earn some good publicity by supporting her sister regardless of the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I care about your money?" Grace suddenly burst into laughter. "Besides, how long do you think you can be Brian's girlfriend for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man like Brian was not at all someone Evelyn could handle. How could Brian not know Evelyn's plot?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she had seen how cold-hearted Brian could be toward his ex-girlfriends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They said Brian would spoil every woman to the skies when he was dating them. However, when she saw Brian treating his ex-girlfriend like that, she realized that maybe the man had never fallen in love with anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only spoiled those women to the skies because the things they wanted did not matter to him&mdash;money, designer clothes, jewelry, houses, cars, all kinds of resources... To him, they were only simple stuff.</p></div>
