        <h1>Chapter 864</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're a good catch. You could attract a lot of good women," said Grace who was already scarred when it came to love and relationships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper parked the car at the gate of the neighborhood where Nelson now lived. Then, he scratched his head shyly and said, "Maybe that's how falling in love is. I just want to give it a try."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a split second, Grace did not know what to say. 'Give it a try. Didn't I have the same idea with Jason?' When Jason wanted to keep her by his side and confessed to her, she gave it a try. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, she lost anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After sending Nelson home, Chase Harper sent Grace to the entrance of her apartment block.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you don't need to feel any pressure. Maybe... After a few years, if you still don't like me, I'll give up," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could feel Chase Harper's kindness. He probably said this because he did not want his feelings for her to become a burden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying goodbye to Chase Harper, Grace got back to her rental house and opened the door only to freeze when she saw the person sitting in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the second time he appeared so &lsquo;openly&rsquo; in her rental house!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It... It was as if he was walking into a no man's land!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're back." Jason looked up. He raised his long eyebrows slightly, and those beautiful eyes looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were sparkling like the surface of a lake in spring. It was as if one would be seduced with just one glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze on the spot and stared at the man sitting elegantly on the stool in her house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His handsome face looked even more noble and elegant as it was set off by a high-end suit that was wrapped around his model-like figure. Under his straight nose bridge, his thin lips parted slightly, looking sexy and charming. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes then rested on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but think of the hickey she saw in the mirror that morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he actually walk into the house after I fell asleep and... kiss me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it's true, why did he do it? He's the one who wanted to break up!' Grace just found herself utterly confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you... doing here?" she asked, pushing away the questions in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Waiting for you. I was wondering when you'd come back," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace furrowed her eyebrows and felt as if the tone of Jason's voice and the aura from his body were carrying a certain danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next thing he said gave her goosebumps all over. What he said was, "You and Chase Harper seemed to have a good time at the amusement park today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace widened her eyes and looked at Jason in surprise. 'How... How does he know?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a woman's voice sounded from the phone Jason had put on the table. "Hey, Nelson, look! It's a Ferris wheel! Why don't the three of us ride the Ferris wheel together later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's... my voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's what I said at the amusement park today! How could he have something I said on his phone?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost subconsciously, Grace ran to the table and saw a video playing on the phone. The scene was of her, Nelson, and Chase Harper at the amusement park today.</p></div>
