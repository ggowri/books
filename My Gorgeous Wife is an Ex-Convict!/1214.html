        <h1>Chapter 1213</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if his words were a sharp sword that could cut her to pieces!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she said, not surprised that he had found out about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You do care about your friend. You stood in front of Brian's mansion all night for Lina, and then you came to me and stood here for so long." His remark was full of sarcasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body quivered, and her hands by her sides tightened as if to give herself more courage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how much Jason wanted to embarrass her, she would endure it. How could she save Lina if she could not endure it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip and said, "I know I may look shameless to you, but... I really need the money. Lina won't be able to survive without the money. I'll do whatever you want as long as you lend me the money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, it doesn't matter what happens to me as long as Lina can survive! Lina gave up her future and lent me a hand when I was at my lowest. Now, I'll give everything I have to save Lina too!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason chuckled and raised his thin lips. "What do you think I need you to do for me? Do you think I'm going to say something stupid like asking you to stay with me again or sleep with me? Trading two million dollars for this? Grace, do you think I can't get a woman, or you're the only one I want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His every word hit her body like a whip, making her distressed but also in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had no way to retort. As he had said, she was now so broke that she had no right to negotiate with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke hoarsely, "Can you tell me what I can do for you to lend me the money?" Now, she could only think on the bright side. If Jason had no intention of lending her money, then Terrence would not have brought her here. He would have let her fend for herself outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly walked toward her. Every step he took was like a step on her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, he walked up to her. His lips were arched at the corners, but his eyes were frightfully cold. "I knelt at your feet and kissed your instep. I was so devoted to you back then. I would have given my all to you. Even if you wanted my life, I would&rsquo;ve given it to you! But you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He snorted. "The next day, you got on your knees for Brian and begged me to let you go! Grace, did you ever have any pity for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit on her lower lip. His coldness gave her great pressure and pain, but she still needed to endure it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'll do whatever I can to make it up to you. Since I hurt you, I'll pay you back..." She suddenly got down on her knees and crouched at his feet in front of him. Her lips were about to kiss the upper of his shoe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a gleam of disbelief in his eyes. He never thought she would do this for Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He grabbed her arm and pulled her to her feet as her lips were about to touch the upper of his shoe. "That's enough. Do you think you can write it off by doing this? Grace, I let you in just to tell you that since you said you don&rsquo;t regret leaving me like that, then now you have no room for regret either!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared blankly at him. Her heart felt as if it was sinking into an abyss. "So... you're not going to lend me two million dollars, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I won't!&rdquo; He suddenly let go. "Who are you to get me to lend you two million dollars?" Who was she to affect his mood and anger him in this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face was full of despair. Her almond-shaped eyes suddenly went blank!</p></div>
