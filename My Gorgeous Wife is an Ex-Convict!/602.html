        <h1>Chapter 601</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are we here?" Grace asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together and looked straight through the car window at the view of Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father had brought him here when he was still alive and said to him, "You know what, Jay? Only when you're on top can you understand what it feels like to be lonely on top. However, if you're not on top, then most of the time, you can't even control your own destiny."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, if he wanted to be in control of his destiny, he had to keep climbing to the top!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the process, whenever he was upset, he would come here and look out at the skyline of Emerald City. He would tell himself that one day, he would be in control of his destiny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, how long had he not been here since he took over Reed Group?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he felt that he was already in complete control of his destiny and would not be pushed around by anyone anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, today, he drove here again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he really in control of his destiny, or was his fate already in the hands of someone else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That person could control all his emotions, make him agitated, and even... Make him feel a long-lost fear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason turned his head, his dark eyes staring at Grace who was sitting next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, his fingers unbuckled the safety belt as he leaned toward her. His hands were on either side of her seat. "All right, you can talk now. Why did you and Brian happen to be in the same shop? Why did he just happen to pick up the phone when I called you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were dark like the deepest ink. No one could see the real emotion in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the face inches before her, took a deep breath, and roughly described what happened when she was delivering food today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she left out the fact that she was being picked on by Andrea Schwartz and only said that her clothes had been splashed with tea. It just so happened that Brian was there too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for why Brian hugged her like that was a surprise to her. She did not expect it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He mistook me for someone else, and I don't remember the things he said ever happening to me," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason's eyes remain fixed on her. "What if he isn&rsquo;t mistaking you for someone else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" She was stunned and looked at him in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he&rsquo;s not mistaking you for someone else, will you fall for him?" he asked. The expression on his face was horribly grim. It was as if once she gave the wrong answer, there would be no end to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Oh, God. How did she get the idea?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed down on the thought that popped into her head. "No, even if he&rsquo;s not mistaking me for someone else and even if I'm really the one he's looking for, I won't fall for him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the beginning, Brian's constant search for a substitute was not something she appreciated. Besides, she already had Jason in her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" An elegant voice rang in her ear. He was staring at her with his head bent low. His fingers lightly brushed against her lips, rubbing them back and forth. It was like a silent seduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt thirsty.</p></div>
