        <h1>Chapter 3425</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After completing the ritual and offering incense, Grace led the youngest Jasmine while the triplets followed behind her, walking towards the main house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Along the way, Jasper asked Mason, "Brother, what happened when you got into a fight at school last time? What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper only knows that there was a fight and several students were hospitalized. His parents went to the hospital to visit the injured students and even paid for all their medical expenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much," Mason pursed his lips and recalled the scene of Veronica standing in front of Daniel in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was her first time protecting another boy, which made him extremely uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like some things are gradually going beyond his expected scope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did those people bully you?" Jasper asked again. She knew that despite her second brother's fierce actions, he would never actively seek trouble with others unless provoked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason looked up and suddenly looked at Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper felt a little overwhelmed by his gaze and asked, "What's wrong with you, Second Brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What does it mean if a girl is willing to risk getting hurt or hit in order to protect another boy?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's eyes widened in surprise as he looked at the other person. After all, Mason rarely spoke so many words at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked about it, or rather, this question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's definitely because this girl likes this boy," said Jasper. "What's up, Second Brother? Did any girl come to protect you when you were fighting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's face slightly sank, his long eyelashes half covering his eyes, but he didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper is used to his younger brother's behavior, so he doesn't bother asking any questions since he knows he won't get any answers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Second Brother has always only valued Sister Veronica. Even if another girl were to come out and protect Second Brother, he would still ignore her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Mason's eyes darkened and his hand hanging by his side involuntarily tightened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, did Auntie rush out to protect Daniel because she likes him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever he thinks about her falling for another guy, he feels extremely upset!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this unpleasant feeling seems to be continuously gnawing at him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica helped Daniel pick out his sneakers, and then Daniel offered to take Veronica out to lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them picked a fast food restaurant in the mall. Veronica held the seats while Daniel went to queue up to order the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the fast food restaurant, there were also several students around their age who were dining, including some couples.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next to Veronica's table, there is a young couple who appear to still be students. They are having a meal together, and the boy is helping the girl by getting her napkins and two drinks. He lets her try both drinks and she chooses the one she likes, while the boy drinks the other one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These two individuals are probably a couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that when a man and a woman are together, they are easily assumed to be a couple. But in the eyes of others, what do they think of her and Daniel?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I don't know if what she and Daniel did today can be considered a date.</p></div>
