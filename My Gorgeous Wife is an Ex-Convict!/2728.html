        <h1>Chapter 2726</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just look at me like this and raise your hands to help me with my collar," he said, still leaning over slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face reddened. Like an obedient student, she raised her hands and randomly fixed his suit collar and shirt collar. "Like this?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he said. His lips curled slightly. It was as if he was watching her with a gentle smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she knew the gentleness was only an act.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without looking up, she could feel many eyes on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Umm... A lot of people are looking at us," she whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know. Let them watch," he said. That was his purpose today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice rang out. "Hey, how enviable it is to watch you two's public display of affection."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned her head and saw Patrick, whom she had seen at the party with Brian's friends. However, Patrick had a new female companion with him today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There you are." Brian straightened up and greeted Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two chatted casually, but Patrick had no intention of introducing the female companion beside him to Brian and Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his opinion, she was only a woman he was fooling around with. They took what they needed from each other, and there was nothing serious about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda is so beautiful today that I almost didn't recognize her." Patrick's eyes fell on Valda Theller. "It seems Brian is quite serious about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick called Valda Theller &lsquo;Valda&rsquo; like he was already familiar with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled sheepishly. Brian wrapped his arm around Valda Theller's waist, pulling her nearer. "I&rsquo;ve always been serious about Valda."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes!" Patrick repeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Valda Theller and said, "Why don't you take a seat? I'll get you something to eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick also turned to his female companion and said, "Sit with Valda." With that said, he walked to the other side with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and Patrick's female companion looked at each other. Finally, she spoke up first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, what's your name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled and said, "My name is Valda Theller. You can call me Valda. What about you? What's your name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My name is Wei Jayg. You can call me Jasperg," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at her. She looked to be in her early 20s and younger than her. She could indeed call her Jasperg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, by the way, Mr. Hart and you are..." Wei Jayg looked inquisitive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're a couple," Valda Theller said naturally.</p></div>
