        <h1>Chapter 277</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sick? You were sick?" There was a sudden tension in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Only a fever which lasted a few days. It made me a little drowsy, but I was alive and kicking when I recovered. Unfortunately, the dress was gone," she said with some regret. However, later, her grandmother secretly told her that she would buy her a beautiful dress if she was ranked first in her class in the final exam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she finally got first place, she had to leave her grandmother to go back to her father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she left, her grandmother slipped a new dress into her luggage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was thinking, a huge hand suddenly came up and touched her forehead. Grace was stunned and looked up at Jason. "I... I don't have a fever now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know," he whispered. "I'll buy you any dress you want in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words gave her a sudden shudder. "It's not like I'm a kid who keeps thinking about dresses." She bit her lip a little and quickly lowered her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The longer she looked at him, the more it seemed to make her heartbeat spin out of control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Jason withdrew his hand and pulled out all the remaining photos in the album. Then, he picked up the photo of her in a floral dress. "Sis, can you give me this photo?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned to see that despite his inquiring tone, his hand had already put the photograph away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want the photo for?" she said blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I find it cute, so I want to keep it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two of them lived together, he did not seem to like the children in the neighborhood. Why did he have a &lsquo;special liking&rsquo; for a photo of her when she was little?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lip slightly and said, "That's the only photo I have of this floral dress." It also carried a rare nostalgia for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was because the floral dress had been given to her by her grandmother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great." A smile flickered at the corners of his mouth. "The photo carries more meaning now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." She was speechless. What was he talking about? "Why don't I get you another photo?" she said, settling for second best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I only want this photo of you," he said, leaning forward to touch her face. "I never change what I like. It's the same with photos. It's the same with people too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was reflected in his dark pupils, and that elegant voice seemed to surround her ears...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was unable to get the photo back from Jason and had to admit defeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she still wondered why he wanted that particular photo of her. Was it that cute that he wanted to keep it?</p></div>
