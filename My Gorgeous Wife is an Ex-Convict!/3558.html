        <h1>Chapter 3556</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You wanted to know the difference between the two, right? If you're in a relationship, you'll do more intimate things like kissing, but if you're not in a relationship, you won't want to kiss the other person." His thin lips moved as he spoke in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to kiss me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her gaze fell on his lips involuntarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His lips were sharp and thin, yet with a hint of sexiness. Suddenly, she had an urge to try kissing those lips and find out how it would feel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh my god, what was she thinking! Jasper felt like his previous thought was as lewd as a woman's!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You, you're joking, right?" She said in a fluster, "You're going to the mixer, I'll go make a call and let my roommates know!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She grabbed her phone and hastily left the table to make a call outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He watched her figure through the transparent floor-to-ceiling window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, she didn't kiss him. Does this mean that she never really considered him as a potential partner?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Will his waiting ultimately lead to the desired outcome?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps only time can provide him with an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he will wait no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the weekend, Jasper and William went to the gathering place together, while Jasper's three roommates rode with William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they saw William's Porsche, they couldn't help but admire it. He really is the childhood friend of the princess, just like the prince and princess in a fairy tale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Barlow really coming to the gathering with us?" Horea couldn't help but ask again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, he's coming with us," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Four girls were together, and while Jasper's attire was similar to usual, the other three girls were clearly dressed up. Even so, among the four girls, Grace stood out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the car, Meave, who talked the most, asked, "Barlow, are you also going to the gathering? Your department should have many girls chasing after you, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just want to go with Jasper and join in the fun," William said. "Also, you are Jasper's roommates, so you can call me by my name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, the three girls looked as if they had won an award, while Jasper curiously asked, "William, do many girls chase after you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Goodness, Jasper, don't you know?" Meave exaggeratedly said, "You should know that at our Stanford University, how many girls have fallen for you, your childhood sweetheart. There was even a ranking before, and William was ranked first as the guy that girls most wanted to date!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked his eyes in surprise. He didn't expect his childhood friend to be so popular. "William, you're amazing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"These rankings don't mean much," William said. For him, all he wanted was her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the five of them arrived at the KTV for the mixer and entered the designated private room, there were already many people there, all of them students from Stanford University.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Jasper didn't know these people, they all knew Jasper and William. They could call out their names directly, indicating the two's popularity in the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially some of the girls, when they saw William, they were even more excited, hoping to show their best side in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Furthermore, from time to time, he would run up to William and ask if he wanted water, a drink, or if he needed tissues, in short, he was trying to find something to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Jasper finally witnessed how popular William was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, William always responded with a calm expression, saying that he didn't need anything. He showed a cold and distant attitude towards those girls.</p></div>
