        <h1>Chapter 4114</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, if you really love Chandler, then get to know this man better! Instead of listening to what others say about his feelings for you, use your own heart to feel it! You're already 20 years old, and in my opinion, not that young anymore. Only your dad and Chandler still treat you like a child," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Thinking back to her own time, she was only two years older than her daughter, but she fell in love with her husband at first sight and even had sex with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking back, if I hadn't taken the initiative with Hadwin, maybe they wouldn't have had any future together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, do you really think I'm not a child?" Tina asked her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, whatever decision you make, I'll support you. Even if you want to have a child, I'll support you," Lina smiled and said. "But before you have a child, you need to ask yourself if you're ready to be a mother! And also, if the child is born, will they be happy? If everything is okay, then I'll support you in having the child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So it doesn't matter if I have a child out of wedlock?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It doesn't matter, as long as the child is born out of 'love'," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina widened her eyes and couldn't help but exclaim, "Mom, you're so open-minded. If that day really comes, please help me deal with Dad!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, she was afraid that the day she had a child out of wedlock, her father would beat Chandler to the point where he couldn't get up in the hospital!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, Mom will help you deal with it, but..." Lina paused and looked at her daughter's flat stomach. "Tell Mom, are you really pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," Tina said. "But I really want to get pregnant soon and have Chandler's child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you like children, there's no need to be in such a hurry," Lina said. But then again, her daughter didn't seem to show any particular liking for children before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's probably because I..." Tina paused. "Love Chandler."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she wanted to have a child as soon as possible to make Chandler no longer suffer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the day of the Stephenson family's trial, Tina hadn't seen Chandler for a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, on the one hand, Tina had been busy avoiding gossip lovers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ever since her scandal with Kit made headlines, even though the news was later retracted and both Kit and the Stephenson family released statements, it seemed like everything was back to normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, there were still plenty of gossip enthusiasts who would find her and even take pictures of her without permission, despite her warnings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Tina could only try to avoid these people as much as possible, and hope that after some time, when the hype died down, they would disperse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she never expected that while trying to avoid the gossip enthusiasts, she would run into Kit again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was quite a coincidence, as Eugenia asked her if she wanted to go to the film and television city over the weekend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the film and television city, there were many filming crews, and if you were lucky, you might run into the filming crew of your favorite celebrity and even get a signed photo with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia, who was a fan of celebrities, had been to the film and television city several times and had even run into the filming crew of her favorite celebrity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, she was even more eager to go to the film and television city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina thought that since she had free time on the weekend, it would be good to go to the film and television city to relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, she wanted to sort out her relationship with Chandler and figure out her next steps.</p></div>
