        <h1>Chapter 3090</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda widened her eyes in astonishment and looked at Brian in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, Valda, don't think that if something happens to you, I can still live well and find another person I love to spend the rest of my life with. That's impossible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His every word flowed continuously into her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At first, you were desperate for me to fall in love with you. Now that I have, you say your feelings for me aren't as strong. So what are your feelings for me now?" he demanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...my feelings for you are just...just like ordinary feelings between friends, I guess..." she stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lie!" he saw through her lie at a glance, "Is it because of your leg that you refuse to face me? Do you think it's ugly? But for me, anything that belongs to you is beautiful, and this injury is proof of your love for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As his voice trailed off, he pressed his lips onto her right calf, kissing it with almost reverent devotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's body stiffened, feeling as if all the blood in her body was rushing towards her calves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Despite having such unattractive legs, he kissed with such sincerity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stiffened her body and stared blankly as he planted small, delicate kisses on her calf and the scar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, he lifted his phoenix-like eyes and gazed steadily at her. In a hoarse voice, he said, "Valda, I love you. Really, please don't doubt what I'm saying. Can you believe me, please? That's all I ask."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." she hesitated, unsure of how to answer him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly stood up and then picked her up horizontally, carrying her into the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was taken aback as she watched him place her on the bed and begin to unbutton his own clothes, realizing instantly what he intended to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, don't do this, you're drunk..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said I love you, but you don't believe me. In that case, I can only prove it with my body," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did drink some alcohol today, but he is far from being drunk. He is fully aware of what he is doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, he took off his upper clothes and leaned down towards her, "I love you, Valda," he said, and kissed her left cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was taken aback, but then he said, "I love you, Valda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lips landed on her right cheek again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And so, he repeated "I love you" over and over again, while kissing her repeatedly. He kissed her from her cheeks to her eyebrows, her eyes, nose, neck, and collarbone...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt as if she was enveloped by his breath, even though he was the one who was clearly drunk. At this moment, she had a feeling of being intoxicated herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The repeated "I love you" sounded like a spell, constantly echoing in her ears, leaving her bewildered yet greedy for more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, those were the words she had longed to hear the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if it's sympathy or pity, she still wants to hear more.</p></div>
