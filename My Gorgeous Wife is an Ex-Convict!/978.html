        <h1>Chapter 977</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'However, is it possible?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could this man be&hellip; Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Is Master Reed, the man who rules Emerald City and who many are intimidated by, the 'younger brother' Grace mentioned?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'However... I remember reading a magazine stating Jason is the only child of the Reed family. He doesn't have any brothers or sisters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'What's more, the way Jason looked at Grace and what he said to Brian just now was nothing a brother would do or say. Instead... It looks more like he&rsquo;s a man who loves Grace deeply!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Are Jason and Brian, the two men at the top of Emerald City, fighting over... Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chase Harper felt that his brain was a little inadequate to process this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella finally came over to Brian. She bit her lip and asked piteously, "Brian, have&hellip; Have you fallen in love with Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Brian replied lightly. He knew about the feelings Stella had for him, but he just did not feel that way about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could treat her as his savior but not a lover. Just like how she was unfamiliar to him the first time he saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace is messing around with Jason. They broke up, but they're still together. If you and&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stella!" Brian interrupted her. His phoenix eyes looked at her coldly as he said, "It's none of your business!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella felt a pang in her heart while the rest of her words seemed to be stuck in her throat. She could not utter a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was not until Brian walked past her that she gritted her teeth and followed him out of the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With difficulty, Stella caught up to Brian who was already near his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, I didn't mean to interfere. I'm just a little scared!" Stella said piteously, her eyes watering a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was true. However, she was not a little scared but very scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Scared?" Brian frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're with Grace, then... Maybe you won't be as good to me as you are now and have time for me. After all, I only helped you once when I was a child. I don't mean much to you, but you... mean a lot... to me," Stella said as she sobbed a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian sighed and said, "Stella, you saved my life, and I'll always remember that. No matter who I love, you don't need to worry about anything. I'll give you the kind of life you want. I can give you good resources if you really want to develop a career in the film industry. You don't have to worry about anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you sure you won't cast me aside?" asked Stella as she sniffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I promised I'll be good to you, so I will," replied Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile appeared on Stella's face. She subconsciously reached out to grab Brian's arm only to be avoided by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She dropped her hand as a look of embarrassment came over her face.</p></div>
