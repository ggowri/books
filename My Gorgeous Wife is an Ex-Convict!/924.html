        <h1>Chapter 923</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She cried out the word over and over again, but she repeatedly told herself in her mind, 'He's Jason. He's just Jason.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just Jay to you." As he spoke, he wrapped his arms around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His scent enveloped her, and a hint of gloom flickered in her almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never be Jay to her. Her Jay was already gone when he said he wanted to break up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hotel room, Martin Weiss said to Paisley Daniels who was on the other end of the line, "Alright, I'll be back tomorrow. I'll take care of all the rumors on the internet." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, what on earth made you leave without even telling me? I... I'm not mad at you. I just want to know the truth." Paisley Daniels's voice sounded somewhat pitiful, and one could not help feeling sorry for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait until I get back," said Martin Weiss as he rubbed his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had hardly slept in the past two days. As long as he closed his eyes, images of his past with Kyla could not help flashing in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought of her laughter, her tears, the way she had cried when she was pregnant with his child, and how he treated her back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought of how she had refused to give him a child by stabbing her stomach with a shard of glass when he found her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A child... She has already given birth to a child of my blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A deaf, disabled child!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of the first time he met Nelson, Martin Weiss had an indescribable feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he asked what was wrong with the child, but Nelson just stared at him with those eyes that were similar to his. He kept gesturing with his fingers, uttering mumbled &lsquo;Ahhhs&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was then he realized that the child was deaf! He could not speak because he was deaf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was known as cold-blooded by outsiders, he sympathized with the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... He never expected that the child he sympathized with was actually his son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My son! I had no idea of his existence until now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Martin Weiss got up, picked up his suit jacket, and walked out of his bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His subordinate, who was in the living room, got up and asked, "Mr. Weiss, it's late. Where are you going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to go to where Kyla is currently staying!" said Martin Weiss. He wanted to take another look at the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" he replied and followed Martin Weiss out of the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to where Kyla was staying, and in about 20 minutes, they reached their destination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a small and cheap hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla opened the hotel room door and saw Martin Weiss, her expression immediately changed. She instinctively wanted to close the door, but his hand stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Believe it or not, if you close the door now, I have a hundred ways to open it again later," he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla trembled. She knew he was capable of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a childlike voice rang. "Mommy, is it Aunty?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was stunned. The next moment, Martin Weiss had completely pushed open the door of the room and spotted Nelson who was standing beside Kyla.</p></div>
