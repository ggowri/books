        <h1>Chapter 3995</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She promised she wouldn't appear in front of him again, but now they've accidentally run into each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Mick seems to be looking at the trees and doesn't seem to have noticed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy lowers her head and plans to quietly leave without attracting his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after taking a few steps, a pair of black leather shoes suddenly catch her eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looks up and sees the familiar handsome face right in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I didn't know you were here," she said. If she had known he would come here too, she would have tried to avoid it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick looked down at the person in front of him. He was only here because he happened to drive by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the "wishing tree" she had mentioned before, he unconsciously got out of the car and walked to the tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just didn't expect to see her making a wish under the tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at the moment he saw her figure, he instinctively doubted whether it was real or an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she had appeared in his dreams many times during this period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you wish for just now?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was startled. "I...I wished for good health and well-being in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she didn't tell him the truth. Even if she did, he would only mock her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Health?" Mick looked at her with disdain. "Is that your wish? As always, it's only about yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remained silent, accepting his mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But here, you don't deserve to make a wish." He walked over to the fence where she had tied the ribbon earlier and reached out to pull it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" She saw what he was about to do and rushed over to stop him. "Don't take the ribbon off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was taken off, the wish would supposedly not come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three wishes she had made before leaving Emerald City were her last wishes, and she hoped they would come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew it was just a superstition, that wishes were only wishes and not reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...she still didn't want him to take off the ribbon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I insist on taking it off?" Mick asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew how ridiculous he was being, but every time he saw her, an unnamed anger rose in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy bit her lip and suddenly said, "You said it yourself that day. We have no relationship between us anymore, and we will only be strangers in the future. If that's the case, Mr. Reed, as a stranger, what right do you have to take off the ribbon I tied?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her retort made him stiffen, and his black eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really want to take it off, I can tie it again. You take it off once, I tie it once. It's just that you're breaking your own words, Mr. Reed. Don't you think it's ridiculous?" Nancy continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's eyes were cold, and it was ridiculous... really ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, this is my final warning to you. Don't let me see you again! Otherwise, even if you're a stranger, I can make it so you'll never be able to walk again!" Mick turned around and warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's eyes dimmed, "In two days, I will leave Emerald City, and I probably won't come back again. So, Mr. Reed, you won't see me again in this lifetime."</span></p></div>
