        <h1>Chapter 660</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay slightly bit her lower lip. "If I hadn't saved you, you wouldn't be nice to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only wanted him to say no, but she was instead met with a pair of indifferent and estranged phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man looked at her calmly as if he was looking at a stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Stella Lindsay felt a pang of regret for what she had just said. "I... I want you to be nice to me not just because I saved your life, but&hellip; But because of something else..." she stammered defensively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, don't overthink it. It's getting late, so you should have an early night," Brian said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he opened the car door and was about to get into the car when Stella Lindsay suddenly said behind him, "Be careful on the way, Bryn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo; made Brian's body stiffen immediately. A memory of the time when the petite figure carried him down the mountain flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The girl kept talking to him as she was afraid that he would faint from the bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's your name? If you don't tell me, I'll call you Bryn. It's the word on the edge of your shirt. Is it your name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't sleep, Bryn. If you do, you won't wake up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me tell you a story. What do you like to hear? I'm a great storyteller! Answer me, Bryn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bryn... Bryn..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo; had haunted his ears again and again over the years, also waking him up from his dream again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had not been there back then, he would not be here now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned around and stared at Stella Lindsay with his phoenix eyes. "All right, I got it." The indifference in his eyes disappeared a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's expression changed once Brian's car drove away. She bit her lower lip, and her hands by her side were clenched into fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyway, she had now taken over Grace's place. As long as Grace did not remember, she would be the little girl who saved Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Brian had been looking for her for so many years, he must have deep feelings for the little girl. If she could make good use of this opportunity, then maybe her life would change dramatically!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, she would seize the opportunity at all costs!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Brian drove, he listened to the song &lsquo;Strolling Down the Path of Life&rsquo;. It was the song &lsquo;she&rsquo; sang when she carried him on her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he listened to her sing, he felt as if the pain on his body was not so bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he listened to the song, he felt as if the pain did not hurt as much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even then... He felt that it would be good to go on like this with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Now that he had found &lsquo;her&rsquo;, why was he not happy? It was Stella Lindsay because she showed him a picture of herself as a child, and Stella Lindsay knew about the song &lsquo;Strolling Down the Path of Life&rsquo;. She also called him Bryn and could even give a rough account of the events back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never told anyone about it, so there was no one Stella Lindsay could have heard it from.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only possibility was that Stella Lindsay was indeed the person he was looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... It was a pity that he felt nothing when he looked at her. It was as if he was just looking at a stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove back to the mansion in Emerald City. Brian opened the car door and got out. He went to his studio and looked at all the paintings he had painted.</p></div>
