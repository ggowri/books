        <h1>Chapter 2186</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper quickly ran away. She put on her night-vision goggles as she ran.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough, there was another power outage in the house moments later. Jasper found her way to the storeroom without any obstacles with the help of the night-vision goggles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was dark inside the storeroom as well. William was still standing inside with a doll in his hand. He managed to find it while the maid who followed him there was standing just a short distance away, mumbling, "What's going on today? The electricity has been cut off twice. But it should be back on soon, Little Young Master. Don't be afraid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper stared blankly through the lens of her night-vision goggles at the person she had been trying to find.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It's William. It's really him. He's standing not far from me. I can touch him if I get just a little bit closer!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Who is it?" William suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His already acute hearing was amplified in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hey, is someone here?" the maid could not help asking as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper suddenly felt her nose grow sore as she walked step by step toward William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's expression changed, and a defensive look appeared on his face. Even his small body was bent over slightly. He was extremely alert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, different from the alertness his body expressed, his hands were wrapped around the doll as if it was much more important than himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper frowned. 'Does he... like dolls? It does seem to be the case. I gave him my favorite doll back then and he has always treasured it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After he left, she could not find it in his room and wondered if he had taken it with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As Jasper moved closer to William, his body tensed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she walked up to him, he could not be tenser. Seeing that her body was about to bump into him, Jasper suddenly embraced the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William stiffened. This embrace... It felt like Jasper was holding him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though the other person said nothing, he knew better than anyone that it was Jasper because he was familiar with her embrace... Incredibly familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry, William," Jasper gently said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, the power supply came back on and the storeroom lit up instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The maid was shocked when she saw another child in the storeroom, and she was even hugging Little Young Master. If the child hurt Little Young Master, Old Master and Old Madam would scold her to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, Little Young Master was now Old Master and Old Madam's little darling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where did you come from? Let go of Little Young Master!" the maid said as she came forward to pull Jasper away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked coldly at the maid. "Don't touch her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The maid immediately stiffened and dared not pull her. 'Does... Little Young Master know this girl?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper hugged William tightly. "William, I'm sorry I misunderstood you. You didn't push Nelson down the stairs. I shouldn't have said those things and not believe you..."</p></div>
