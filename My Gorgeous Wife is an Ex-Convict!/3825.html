        <h1>Chapter 3823</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Mason seemed to really want to lie down, Veronica quickly walked to his bedside and helped him up by the waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her purpose was to not let him lie down like that, because she hadn't finished talking yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this action added a hint of ambiguity between the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" he glanced at her lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I haven't finished talking. I want to finish talking with you," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason pursed his lips. "Okay, you can speak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica saw that he didn't ask her to let go of his hand, so she simply let her hand continue to rest against his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being close to him again, it felt like they were back to the past, with no misunderstandings, no conflicts, and no separation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Veronica continued, "I mentioned Daniel not to plead for him, but because it was my mistake that led to my own kidnapping and implicated you. I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to apologize. Since you know you almost lost your life this time, don't misjudge people like that again," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And..." Veronica paused, "When you came to rescue me, I was both happy and scared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her, with a hint of confusion in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was happy that you were willing to risk your life to save me, which means I'm not insignificant to you and you still care about me. But I was also scared that we would die together in the old campus and that I would implicate you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica glanced at the areas where Mason's bandages were visible outside of his hospital gown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she still implicated him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for her, he wouldn't have suffered these injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, I love you. I'm sure of my feelings, but do you love me? Are you willing to be with me again?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God knows how much courage it took for her to say these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid of being rejected, afraid that it was all in her head, afraid of expecting too much and ending up disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said I love you. If you love me too, I hope we can be together again," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained silent, and in the quiet hospital room, every minute seemed particularly long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said nothing, just looked at her, and she almost held her breath waiting for his </span><span>answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the distance between the two of them was very close, and she could even touch his face with just a slight movement of her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Saving you doesn't mean anything," he finally spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence was like a disguised rejection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt a wave of disappointment in her heart, but she still didn't want to give up. "So, would you risk your life to save someone who is not related to you by blood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, you have been with me for many years. Saving you is just human nature, isn't it?" he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why did you push me away and let me escape when you were hit by a rock in the end? Why did you just let me go when I was trying to move the rocks? Were you afraid that I would die too?" Veronica asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I didn't think it would be useful for you to stay there. In that case, it would be more practical for you to escape first," Jasper replied expressionlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the fact is, it was useful for me to stay there and move the rocks off your leg. We both survived!" Veronica looked at Mason with a determined gaze.</span></p></div>
