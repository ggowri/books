        <h1>Chapter 2625</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should have broken up with Raymond Bowman as soon as she heard this. If she were even more ruthless, she should have recorded it and exposed it so that others could criticize the shameless couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was foolish enough to think that Raymond Bowman would have some affection for her, so she went to meet up with him with the last hope that he would not hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, she underestimated the evil of human nature and became the school's laughing stock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman eventually became a wound in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it gradually recovered as the years went by. "Camille, don't worry. Raymond Bowman is history to me. At most, I'm just a little disgusted by him." The disgust became even more obvious, especially when Raymond Bowman grabbed her hand today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good." Camille Strickland was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Valda Theller looked through her phone contact list and looked at the words &lsquo;Brian&rsquo; that showed up on her screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was rather ridiculous that she got a boyfriend in such a way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was considered a gain that he agreed to model for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Valda Theller texted her schedule to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Valda Theller went on her first date with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Is there anything we need to do when we meet?" Valda Theller asked. After all, her experience of dating the opposite sex was limited to her time with Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can do whatever you want," Brian said indifferently. Although there was still indifference and estrangement on his face, what he said was enough to provoke the imagination of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller wailed to herself. 'Does he know how easily his statement can mislead others? If he ran into someone who had other ideas for him, he wouldn't...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The seductive image instantly came to her mind...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" His voice suddenly rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instantly came to her senses and blushed. "Uh... Nothing. I'm thinking we could go to my go to comic cafe to hang out, get a table, and read comics or something if it's okay with you. By the way, do you read comics? We can do something else if you don't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you go there often?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's a hobby and a necessity for my work," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go there. The idea is to spend more time together and get to know each other better," said Brian. Otherwise, Grace could probably see through him quickly even if they acted in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since he wanted to put on a show, he would try his best to make it realistic and convince Grace that he had indeed gotten over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe she would feel relieved in that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The comic cafe Valda Theller mentioned was located in the west of tMason Swansonty. It had many comics and independent private rooms equipped with computers and internet access.</p></div>
