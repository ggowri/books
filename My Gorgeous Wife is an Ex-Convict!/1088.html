        <h1>Chapter 1087</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides... His posture was the same as before she drew the curtain. He was still standing there with his chin up, looking in her direction!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly had an indescribable feeling, and she rushed out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not knowing where to find an umbrella, Grace grabbed a blanket, put it on top of her head, and rushed out in the rain to the lotus pond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the blanket covered the top of her head and parts of her body, the rain still hit her arms and the front of her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The raindrops were icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly ran up to Jason, gasped slightly, and said, "What are you doing standing here? It's raining. Hurry back in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not budge and stood where he was. "Why did you come out?" His cold voice rang out on the rainy night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was all wet. His hair and face were wet with rain, and his black eyes were looking at her through the rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll talk about it after we get inside," she said and took his hand to pull him inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not move. "Why did you come out?" He repeated the previous question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no choice but to say, "Am I supposed to keep watching you stand in the rain if I don't come out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you worried about me being caught in the rain?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was rendered speechless. She glared at him. Seeing that the rain was getting heavier and heavier and his body was drenched, he would probably get sick if this went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could hear was the rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long pause, Grace finally said, "Let's just say I'm worried. Can we get in now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Let's assume I don't want him to get sick, especially when we're the only ones here. It would be difficult to deal with if something happens to him!' Grace gave herself an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However&hellip; am I not worried at all?' asked a voice in her heart, but she could not give an answer at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason opened his thin lips and gently uttered a word, "Okay." Then, he held her hand tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took him by the hand and went into the house. She was not that wet, so a little toweling off would do, but he was terribly drenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should take a hot bath, or you'll catch a cold easily," she said and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hand was still holding hers tightly, refusing to loosen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not leave at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you let go? I'm going back to&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not manage to finish her sentence when his voice interrupted her. "Stay with me!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stay with him? When he's looking like this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should take a hot bath now," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stay with me." He stared at her as if he would not take no for an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She even had a feeling that if she refused, then maybe... he would do something dangerous that would be too much for her to handle...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated a little before saying, "Then... I'll wait for you outside while you take a hot bath."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes softened when he heard this. "Okay, you&rsquo;ve promised to wait for me," he said hoarsely while the remnants of the rain trickled down his cheeks.</p></div>
