        <h1>Chapter 1224</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young Woman: [Who is it? Is he some newly debuted celebrity?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Entertainment Reporter: [A celebrity? That's Jason!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young Woman: [Jason? Which Jason?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Entertainment Reporter: [How many Jason do you think there are in Emerald City?] </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was stunned. Then she saw that they were calling over number nine. Jason took Grace's hand and walked toward the counter for marriage registration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman stared blankly at Jason's back. 'Is this the president of Reed Group? The man they call Master Reed?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, a WeChat message notification rang again on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Entertainment Reporter: [Where did you meet Jason?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young Woman: [TMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Entertainment Reporter: [What is he doing at tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The message was followed by a confused emoji.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young Woman: [Probably... to get married.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was still a little out of it. Emerald City's famous Master Reed was right before her eyes waiting for his number to be called to... register his marriage to a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did she find it so unreal?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Entertainment Reporter: [Then it can't be Jason. It's probably just someone who looks like Jason.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman finally came to her senses after seeing that. 'I knew it. How could he be Jason? No matter what, people like Jason did not have to take queue numbers and wait for their turns to register their marriage.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the woman thought about it, she suddenly saw the staff's expression change drastically. They trembled like a leaf after receiving the couple&rsquo;s household registration books and ID cards. They had helped the couple earlier with their registration. Moments later, several Civil Affairs Bureau staff in uniforms came scurrying over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman looked at the middle-aged man leading the group. He was not wearing a uniform, but he looked familiar. Yes, she remembered. She had seen a picture of tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau's management team when she came in. He seemed to be the managing director here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was the managing director doing at the registration counter? To supervise?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the woman's eyes almost popped out. The... The managing director stepped into the counter, took the place of the staff who was trembling like a leaf, and handled the couple's registration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did they need the managing director to step in for such a thing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if the trembling employee was unable to do the registration, they could always find someone else to take their place!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wait, does that mean... That man does look like Jason, and he&rsquo;s actually...' The woman tensed again at the thought of this possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The managing director of tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau was similarly tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though he was used to vicissitudes, he almost fell off his chair when he learned that Jason was registering his marriage at their branch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Emerald City's Master Reed is here to... register his marriage? I haven't heard of such matters before. Besides, is Master Reed the kind of person who waits in line for his number to be called?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He secretly criticized the staff, who was trembling like a leaf, for humiliating the entire branch in front of Master Reed. However, when he handled it himself, his palms began to sweat like the staff&rsquo;s.</p></div>
