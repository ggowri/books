        <h1>Chapter 285</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was carrying him on her back with difficulty as she kept saying, "Don't be afraid. I'll carry you down the hill. I'll take you to the policeman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Don't be afraid...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her body was shaking so much that even when she spoke, her voice trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was she who was afraid, but she kept on comforting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're so heavy..." She could not help but complain occasionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry." Back then, he apologized for this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hehe. When you get better later, you can carry me so that we're even," she said with a smile, trying to move on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never thought that one day he would be protected by a girl younger than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll carry you in the future," he said to her as if it was a promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said to himself in his heart that in the future, he would carry her. No matter what difficulty there was, he would carry her all the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Where on earth was she?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For many years, he was always regretful of why he had let go of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had held on to her hand back then, would she always be by his side now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was not the one he was looking for, so... "Where are you?" he asked in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What responded to him was the silence in the air as usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found the time to go to the Sanitation Service Center and resign. When the director of the Sanitation Service Center learned that she was quitting, he was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're quitting? What's wrong? Are you dissatisfied with your salary at the center? If you feel it's too tiring to sweep the floor, I can change your position and transfer you to an office position," the director said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Earlier, he had received a call from the management department to apply for leave for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, he had been in a daze for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before that, there were people in the center who were against working with Grace and tried to kick her out of the Sanitation Service Center. However, the director then received a call from his superior, asking him to deal with this matter properly and not to encourage such discrimination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment there, he thought it might be the Stevens family's first young master's doings. After all, Grace was Young Master Stevens 's ex-girlfriend. He probably still had some feelings left for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he raised his doubts about it, he got a meaningful reply. "The person behind her is someone even Sean can&rsquo;t afford to offend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he felt a shudder running through his spine and trembled all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Originally, the director wanted to satisfy all of Grace's wants and needs, but to his surprise, she offered to resign.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll pass." Grace shook her head. When had she ever seen the director try so hard to keep a sweeper? It was clear that the director knew something.</p></div>
