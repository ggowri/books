        <h1>Chapter 1016</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;These few days, Grace had been coming home alone, so it was alright. However, Young Master Hart sent Grace home today and now&hellip; Young Master Hart's holding Grace's hands as they&rsquo;re looking at each other, just like a couple!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence just hoped Brian and Grace would separate as soon as possible. 'If they keep on hanging around like this, who knows what Master Reed would do?!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked to her rental house with a box of pancakes in her hand. She took out the keys from her bag and opened the door. Just as she was about to push the door open and walk in, another hand beat her to the door and pushed it open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback and turned around immediately, only to see Jason standing behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When did you come?" she asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was wearing a thin light-colored sweater and a pair of black trousers. With his handsome face, he looked just like Prince Charming. However, his face was dark and there was restraint, struggle, and... rage in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It gave her an almost instinctive sense of crisis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was dangerous right now, and she might get hurt if she made a mistake!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Won't you invite me in?" His cold voice rang slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's late now..." She wanted to refuse, but he approached her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace subconsciously stepped back while Jason approached her until they both walked into the house. He then shut the door behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With the sound of the door closing, the house immediately became quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath. "Can I help you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gazed at the takeaway box in her hands. "Brian gave this to you, didn't he? Were you with him today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and realized he had probably seen Brian walking her to the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you have dinner together?" he asked, inching closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Step by step, she retreated until her back was against the wall. There was no more space behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands rested against the space on the wall on both sides of her body. He lowered his head, and his normally bright and charismatic eyes were now dark. "Have you fallen for Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly. "No, alright? I want to go to bed now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her hand to push him away, but the next moment, he grabbed her hands. His fingertips caressed her hands as he muttered, "You didn't reject him when he touched you. Why did you let him hold your hands if you haven&rsquo;t fallen for him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why... Because it's Bryn, because&hellip;' At that moment, she could not help but wonder if her life would have been different if she had not lost that memory or if she had remembered that part of her childhood before the car accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just because I haven&rsquo;t fallen for him doesn't mean he can't hold my hands. It's just like how you're also holding my hands when I have no interest in you," retorted Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression immediately changed. A moment later, he dragged her into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, what are you trying to do?" cried Grace as she struggled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned on the tap on the sink, water immediately gushing out.</p></div>
