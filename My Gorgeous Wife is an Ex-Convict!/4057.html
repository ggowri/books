        <h1>Chapter 4055</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Can't she watch the game at home? Why does she have to go to someone else's house?" Hadwin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What do you mean someone else's house? Is Chandler a stranger?" Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm just worried about them being alone in a room together. What if something happens?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You still don't trust Chandler?" Lina laughed. "I know you're worried as a father, but I've known Chandler for years and I trust his character. He won't do anything to Tina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin grumbled, "I'm not worried about him doing something to Tina, I'm worried about Tina doing something to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As her father, Hadwin knew his daughter well. And with Chandler's stunning looks, he was afraid that his daughter might be swayed by his beauty and do something foolish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In a father's eyes, even if his daughter was the one who initiated it, she would still be the one at a disadvantage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina rested her chin on her hand and thought about what her husband had said. Then she suddenly said, "If that's the case, then our daughter is lucky. They will be together sooner or later, and it doesn't make much difference."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, their daughter was already an adult, 20 years old. Lina wasn't a conservative person and didn't think her daughter would be at a disadvantage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As long as they took the necessary precautions, everything would be fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Besides, if something did happen between them, they wouldn't need her to remind them to take precautions. Chandler would take the initiative to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "How can you say it doesn't make a difference? Tina is only 20 years old. If something really happens between them..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "When we had sex back then, I wasn't much older than Tina," Lina said. "And I was the one who initiated it. Do you think I was at a disadvantage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As soon as these words were spoken, Hadwin's face immediately became embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Well, back then, he felt like he had been taken advantage of. After all, Lina had taken everything from him and left, causing him to look for her for several years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So, our daughter is like me, she won't be taken advantage of." Lina said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, Tina is like you." Hadwin looked at his wife and remembered their first night together abroad, his eyes filled with desire. "Lina, since Tina won't be coming back tonight, let's have a good night together..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay." Lina enthusiastically kissed her husband on the cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After so many years of marriage, her husband still loved her so much. This was the greatest happiness for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At night, facing the "beauty" of Tina, her father did not cooperate like her mother did. On the contrary, her "beauty" was simply uncooperative to the extreme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As she watched the game and teased him with her paws, he pressed her paws down after just a few touches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Don't move your hands around, I'm still a man after all." Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "..." It was precisely because he was a man that her hands moved around!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Originally, she wanted to take the initiative to "tease" him and see what kind of reaction he would have. This way, when they were "intimate", she would know what she could accept and whether she really loved him or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she didn't expect to be stopped as soon as she started!</p></div>
