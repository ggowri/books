        <h1>Chapter 3721</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you want to try and see if you like me now?" His voice rang in her ears again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at this beautiful face in front of her, which was familiar yet strange to her. After years of separation, his face seemed to have become even more beautiful, losing some of its delicacy and gaining a bit of masculine sharpness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I like you," she said honestly, not wanting to hide anything from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they finally had the chance to be together again, she didn't want to miss this opportunity due to misunderstandings caused by hiding things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like me?" He narrowed his eyes slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I like you, but I'm not sure if it's still the kind of liking I had for my little brother. After all, I always treated you like a little brother before...and then..." Her voice trailed off and she didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they separated, she never dated anyone else, and even her classmates sometimes asked her why she didn't have a boyfriend and if she couldn't forget her first love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First love?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her first love was Daniel, then she knew very well that she had let go of those feelings. She rarely thought about the time when she was with Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she couldn't forget were the moments she spent with Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also wondered if her feelings for him were just sisterly or something more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't dated Daniel back then, and if she and Mason had continued their brother-sister relationship, would she have agreed to date him if he had asked her out after they entered college and matured emotionally? She didn't know the answer since it was all hypothetical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Mason didn't ask anything and just let go of her hand, continuing to eat the dumplings that he hadn't finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica withdrew her hand and after a moment of contemplation, she said, "Do you want me to tidy up the other room and make it your room? So when you come over, </span><span>you can rest in the room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. If I want to rest in the room, I can go to your room. After all, we used to share a room, didn't we?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was speechless. That was a long time ago, before the Reed family recognized him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, after the Reed family recognized him, they bought a big house for the Barlow family, and they each had their own rooms. However, for a long time, even though he had his own room, he would still come to her room, crawl into her bed, and hold her hand to fall asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finished eating the dumplings and cleaned up, she saw that he had no intention of leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you going back?" she couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No rush. If you're tired, you can go back to your room and sleep," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was speechless again. How could she possibly sleep peacefully in her room with him here? "Then, do you want to watch TV together for a while?"</span></p></div>
