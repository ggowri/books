        <h1>Chapter 198</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, Grace knew what they were up to. The only reason they called her over was to get her to pay the fees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she guessed it right, these people in front of her would have prepared what they were going to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, once Old Mr. Kelleigh finished, her first uncle immediately said, "Dad, we don't have any money. I don't even have the money for my son to get married. Otherwise, my Hogan&rsquo;s wedding wouldn&rsquo;t be dragged until now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Dad, we don't have money!" Her second uncle also joined in immediately before bitterly turning his face to Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, if our family wasn&rsquo;t poor, we wouldn&rsquo;t have thought about marrying you into the Miller family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So just because you're poor, you can marry me to a fool? Do you have the right to do so just because you&rsquo;re poor?&rdquo; Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While her second uncle was frozen in place, her first uncle said with a look of dissatisfaction, "Your two cousins don't even have wives. They're responsible for carrying on the Kelleigh family line. Your grandmother has always been so kind to you. Don't you want to repay her? Besides, you've been to prison. It&rsquo;ll be nice if someone is willing to marry you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandmother's the one who is good to me, not you. Why should I repay you with my body? " Grace was amused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people would always be so selfish. They only thought about how others should give them, but never about what they had given others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well then, since you&rsquo;ve also said that it&rsquo;s your grandmother who is good to you, then you should also bear some of the cost for her medical expenses.&rdquo; Her third aunt looked as if she had caught Grace by her words. Her face was full of pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was not surprised that her third aunt would say so. She simply stood quietly to see what her third aunt would say next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her third aunt then continued. "Grace, you should have told us earlier that you know a big shot. We wouldn't have had such a misunderstanding then. We just want you to have someone to rely on in the future!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know where you got your luck, Grace. You even know someone so important. Does that man know that you've been to prison? You're not keeping anything from him, are you?" Her cousin Stella Lindsay said sourly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never seen the man but heard her first uncle and second uncle describing the scene and the man's appearance. After hearing it, she felt extremely jealous. Why did Grace have such a big shot like him to protect her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Should not all men look down at a woman who had been to prison?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace just smiled coldly, still in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her third aunt gave her daughter a gentle sigh, then said to Grace, "Now that you have someone to back you up, that's your capability. Surely you are not short of money, so why don't you bear all your grandmother's medical expenses? Besides, we're always traveling to the hospital to accompany her. You should reimburse us for the trips and meals. Your grandmother needs people to help her eat, drink, and use the toilet, so we need to hire a caretaker for her as well. All this will probably cost 200,000 a year. If your grandmother&rsquo;s medical bills increase again in the future, we&rsquo;ll figure it out when the time comes.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's do it this way then," Old Mr. Kelleigh concluded after her third aunt finished. "Grace, transfer 200,000 into your first uncle's bank account later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't agree to this," Grace said bluntly.</p></div>
