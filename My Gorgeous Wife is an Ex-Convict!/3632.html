        <h1>Chapter 3630</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Jasper thought he was Lawrence before, so he conducted some investigations on him. However, in the end, he took his blood sample and compared it with Lawrence's DNA, and they didn't match," William explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Jason said thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper personally obtained Roger's blood sample, and I sent it for DNA testing. It didn't pass through anyone else's hands," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it means that if someone wanted to change the results, they would just need to switch the sample?" Jason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have it, and I won't." William replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must also be afraid that Lawrence will really be found, Jasper feels so guilty towards Lawrence, no one knows what will happen if Lawrence really appears in front of her, how she will make it up to Lawrence, and what will happen to her feelings for Lawrence." Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words were like directly pointing out the thing that William feared the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William naturally understood that in front of someone like Jason, lying would be akin to shooting himself in the foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Uncle Reed, I'm afraid. But I also know that Lawrence is a knot in Jasper's heart. Even though I'm scared, I also hope that Lawrence is still alive, so that this knot in Jasper's heart can be untied." William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason looked at William, seemingly examining the truthfulness of his words, and after a moment, he said, "So why do you think this Roger went to find your grandparents, and even instigated them to come to Emerald City to find you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know," William said. "I only met Roger after I entered Stanford University."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will have someone investigate him. Since your grandparents' situation is related to him, perhaps the person behind the school forum posts may also be connected to him." Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that post is really related to Roger, then what is Roger's purpose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The DNA test results show that Roger is not Lawrence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or... is there some kind of connection between Roger and Lawrence? Are they relatives of the Abbott family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, is it because of his appearance that he resembles Lawrence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for him, all of these are still just speculations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you don't mention Roger to Jasper until we find out the results, I'm afraid she might overthink," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Jason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the living room of the Reed family, Mick was questioning Jasper, "Are you really dating William? Wasn't it just for show in front of the media?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I pretend in front of others? It's true if it's true, and it's not if it's not," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it seems like this incident turned out to be a blessing in disguise for William. Otherwise, he might not have had the awakening so quickly," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper raised an eyebrow and glanced at his older brother. "I already have a girlfriend. When are you going to get a girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like a troublesome thing to me. I'm not really interested in women," Mick replied with a lack of enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper furrowed his brow. "Don't tell me you're interested in men. Although... if that's true, Mom and Dad should respect your choice. Mason, Jasmine, and I would also respect our </span><span>sister-in-law. But same-sex marriage is not allowed in our country, so you can only register the marriage abroad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're thinking too much!" Mick raised his hand and gave his sister a light slap. "Wait until the day I actually like men, then you can say something like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this? Do you like men?" A cold voice suddenly sounded in the Reed family's living room.</span></p></div>
