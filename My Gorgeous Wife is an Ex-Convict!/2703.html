        <h1>Chapter 2701</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They then left the private room. Queenie Mack was delighted. 'Since Patrick let me stay, it means he'll help me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Queenie Mack, what do you want me to help you with?" Patrick asked lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I want to speak to you alone," said Queenie Mack. After all, it was not a glorious thing. Especially since all his friends were here. It would be humiliating for her to say it here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no need for that. Just say it here," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack clenched her teeth and could only say as concisely as possible, "I... I seem to have offended the Hart family. Will you please plead with the Hart family for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh? Did you offend the Hart family?" Patrick smiled playfully before turning to Brian and asked, "Brian, how did this woman offend you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack was shocked. She immediately looked in the direction Patrick spoke to but saw Valda Theller being pulled up from the floor by Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, what are you doing here?" Queenie Mack asked in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why can't my girlfriend be here?" Brian asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She... She's your girlfriend?" Queenie Mack's expression changed again. She recognized the man before her as the crown prince of the entertainment industry, Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But... Valda Theller is Brian's girlfriend? How is that possible? They look like people who would never have anything to do with each other!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller was now standing beside Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack suddenly understood why the lawyer told her that she had offended the Hart family and why Hart Group's executive assistant came to the set with backup to save Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all because Valda Theller was Brian's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack paled as she trembled all over. Who would have thought that she would hit a snag when she was wilfully trying to teach a comic artist she disliked a lesson?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda..." Queenie Mack reluctantly forced a timid yet sincere expression. "I did some bad things to you and gave you unpleasant memories, but I regret everything now. I've been wanting to apologize to you. I didn't expect to meet you here. I... I'll solemnly apologize to you right now. Forgive me. I'll bear all your losses. Tell me how much you need for the medical fees, lost labor costs, and the like. I'll compensate you right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack said as she pretended to look tearful. She bowed and apologized to Valda Theller. The way she looked would probably make others think she was the one who was wronged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Normally, the way she looked might have made heirs pity her, but none of them said anything today. They simply watched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned in disgust. She was not a fool. She could naturally see that Queenie Mack did not want to apologize to her. Queenie Mack would never have given in if the person standing next to her was not Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to apologize to me. Let the law decide what you're responsible for and the sentence you'll receive," Valda Theller said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack stiffened. Her hands dangling beside her clenched her clothes tightly. Her resentment for Valda Theller grew deeper, but she still put on a pitiful expression. "No, I can't go to jail. My life will be ruined if I go to jail. Valda, forgive me. Please forgive me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack said and stretched out her hand to catch Valda Theller's arm, but Brian pulled Valda Theller aside, making Queenie Mack's hand miss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Queenie Mack in silence. She had no intention to say that she forgave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack clenched her teeth before saying to Brian, "Mr. Hart, I apologize from the bottom of my heart. Please let me off this time. Aren't you friends with Patrick? Be the bigger person for Patrick's sake. Don&rsquo;t go after a woman like me."</p></div>
