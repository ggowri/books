        <h1>Chapter 263</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, you'd better take everything I've said to heart," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. What did he mean by that? Take it to heart...?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would marry her if she was willing to marry him. Did he know what that meant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's mind was all messed up until they got into the car. Once the car reached the Reed Residence, she followed Jason out of the car and was just about to enter the house when he stopped abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, it's not that I've never starved," he said. "There were times when I was so hungry I thought I would die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was still young, his father passed away, and his body was cremated. Jason remained in the small shabby house while holding onto the urn filled with his father&rsquo;s ashes. At that time, he was famished. He was so hungry that he almost lost his strength. He only narrowly missed death. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, a neighbor knocked on the door and offered him something to eat. It was only then did he recover his strength and vigor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and looked at him in surprise. When he said this, his light tone made her feel a little distressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought of the childhood stories he had previously told her when he was still Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mother left him and his father&hellip; died in the snow. Before he joined the Reed family, he must have led a tough life...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but slightly fold her hands that were on the sides of her body. Earlier when he said those last few words, she even unconsciously wanted to pat his head and comfort him as she used to do before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it occurred to her in the next moment that he was not Jay. He was Jason, someone she was not supposed to touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the Cummins family house, Evelyn was crying out to her parents about the grievances she faced while at the filming site.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I kneel before Sis in front of so many people? She knows Jason and didn't tell us. She did that on purpose! She just wanted to see me make a fool of myself!" Evelyn sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? She knows Jason?" Tony Cummins was taken aback. "Which Jason is it? It can't be Jason from Reed Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Few people in Emerald City did not know the name Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Evelyn saw her father's excited expression, she knew what he was thinking. "Dad, even if Sis knows Jason now, do you think he's serious about her? Don&rsquo;t forget that it was Jason's fiancee whom Sis ran over and killed. Who knows what he&rsquo;s thinking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right!" Melinda Riley chimed in and said, "I suppose it's the wealthy's revenge. He&rsquo;s probably trying to praise her highly before letting her fall. Isn't that what happens in a lot of TV dramas?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their words were like a basin of cold water, instantly putting out the ideas Tony Cummins had in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were right. His daughter was only a sanitation service worker who had been to prison. Who was Jason? Could he take a fancy to a sanitation service worker who had been to prison?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, Sis was deliberately friendly to Brian. This made Brian misunderstand me and think that I have something against her." Evelyn continued complaining. "Dad, what kind of older sister will do that? Other people's older sisters are happy to see their younger sister doing well, but my sister is holding me back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was continuing her efforts. "If Brian breaks up with me because of Sis, I don't know what I'll do. I really love Brian, Dad."</p></div>
