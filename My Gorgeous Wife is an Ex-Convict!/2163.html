        <h1>Chapter 2161</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing that William refused to apologize no matter what she said, Jasper snapped. "If you don't apologize, I won't play with you anymore. I don't want to be your friend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This was the biggest threat to children!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's face instantly paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He reached out to grab Jasper and tell her that he only tried to push Nelson Corbyn away because he heard a sound. He never touched Nelson Corbyn. Nelson Corbyn tried to dodge him, so he lost his footing and fell down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His hands caught nothing but air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They were empty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At this moment, the maids around him looked at him with scorn, disgust, and disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He winced a little as he slowly lowered his hand. He hung his head low as he pitifully returned to his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The room was so quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had never found the room so quiet before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is Jasper gonna stop thinking of me as a friend? At the end of the day, I'm just a toy. How could I be her friend... How could I...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William cowered in the corner. His entire body was curled up into a ball. 'It's so cold... I feel so cold...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Jason came back in the evening, Grace told him what had happened at Lina's place today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows when he heard that William had pushed Nelson downstairs. "Did he really push him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jasper and Mick saw it, so that&rsquo;s probably the case. Nelson didn&rsquo;t deny it either. I asked William afterward and he said he did push Nelson, but it was because he heard a sound heading toward Nelson,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"A sound?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He couldn't tell me the details, so I decided to check out Lina's place again. I'll also have to go to Nelson and ask what exactly happened," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is Nelson okay?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I called Kyla and asked. He's okay so far, but some test results won't come back until tomorrow," said Grace. Then, she asked Jason a little hesitantly, "Do you think William pushed Nelson down the stairs on purpose?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes glimmered slightly before he suddenly said, "Jasper and Nelson are close, aren't they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, why did you mention that all of a sudden?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William likes Jasper very much too," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace paused for a moment before understanding what he meant. "No way. Are you saying William pushed Nelson down the stairs because he was jealous that Jasper's close to Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "After all, it's hard to tell what's going on in one&rsquo;s mind, not to mention one&rsquo;s emotions. Even adults have trouble controlling their emotions, let alone a child. William has always been with Lily. Maybe he took after Lily's character."</p></div>
