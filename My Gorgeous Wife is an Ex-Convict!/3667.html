        <h1>Chapter 3665</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jasper was thinking, Roger suddenly turned his head and looked in her direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, their eyes met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suddenly felt embarrassed, as if she had been caught peeking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger, on the other hand, seemed to have a stronger smile on his lips. He looked at Jasper for a moment, then turned his head and talked more intimately with the girl next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper felt a strange sensation, as if everything he did was deliberate and forced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is she thinking? Why does he have to act deliberately again? Is he trying to impress her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It doesn't make any sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper shook his head and said to his roommates, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of four left without noticing Roger's gaze, which seemed to glance back at where they had been standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roger, what's wrong?" a girl's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing," Roger said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I really accompany you to the piano room tomorrow and listen to you play?" the other person said admiringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course you can. It's something I've been hoping for if you're willing to listen to me play," he said with a slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, when Jasper arrived at the school's piano room to practice, he only saw Roger with the same girl from yesterday, who had just filled out the borrowing form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a coincidence, we meet again here," Roger greeted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's quite a coincidence," Jasper said, his gaze falling on the girl next to Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Roger didn't seem to have any intention of introducing her, and instead said, "Where's William? Why isn't he with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has class, and besides, I just came here to practice and don't need anyone to accompany me," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, isn't your sister's birthday coming up soon?" Roger suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? Yes," she hesitated for a moment before responding, not understanding why he suddenly brought this up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, can you give me an invitation?" he asked, "After all, I have also received favors from the Reed family before. It's your sister's birthday, and I also want to congratulate </span><span>her in person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasmine's birthday this year is just a small celebration, so we're only inviting some close friends and family," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm not considered a close friend or family, and I don't even have the qualification to give a gift, right?" Roger asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not, that's not what I meant," Jasper quickly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, can you give me an invitation?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pursed her lips for a moment, "Okay, I'll prepare an invitation for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll wait for you to 'personally' give me the invitation," Roger said, turning around and leading the girl into the piano room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered the piano room, the girl asked, "That was Jasper, the Grand Princess of the Reed family. Are you close with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it matter if we're close or not?" Roger said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then when did you receive favors from the Reed family? Weren't you always abroad since you were young?" the girl asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to know?" Roger stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I like you, so I want to know about you. What's wrong with that?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's lips curled up, his eyes full of smiles, but his gaze was cold. "But for me, I don't want others to know too much about me. For me, that's certainly not right!"</span></p></div>
