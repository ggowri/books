        <h1>Chapter 2482</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After so many years of marriage, George Gregory's heart turned out to be more ruthless than she had imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If George Gregory was unwilling to help, she had to drag down the Gregory family with her. The Mitchell family could not collapse, and she could not let Amber Mitchell get everything back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell went to Gregory Corporation&rsquo;s office building and walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in the company knew the president's wife, of course. They started talking as soon as Louise Mitchell stepped into the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, everyone knew about the latest hot news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell went to George Gregory's office but was stopped by his secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Gregory, the president is talking business with someone in the office right now. If you want to see him, you&rsquo;ll have to wait."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have something important to talk to him about," said Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You still have to wait," the secretary said forcefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was mad, feeling like the secretary was looking at her with contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's with that look? What's the matter? Do you think even a mere secretary like you can look down on me because the Mitchell family is in trouble now?" Louise Mitchell snapped right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary said calmly, "Mrs. Gregory, you're overthinking. I'm not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not? Then why are you stopping me from entering Mr. Gregory's office?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory said no one is allowed to enter the office and disturb him," the secretary said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Louise Mitchell immediately slapped her as soon as she said that. "I'm the president's wife! If you don't let me in, I'll send you packing tomorrow!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know when the Mitchell family became so influential that you can even fire my secretary at any time." a man&rsquo;s voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell froze in shock as she watched George Gregory and several senior executives come out of the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George, I... I only want to see you, but your secretary stopped me," explained Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I ordered her to do so. She didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong when she stopped you,&rdquo; George Gregory said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His statement was equivalent to a huge slap in her face in front of everyone. Louise Mitchell's face turned pale and red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what embarrassed her more was when George Gregory added, "You're my wife, but that doesn't mean you have the right to dismiss anyone from my company. Besides, shouldn't you apologize for slapping someone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Apologize?" Louise Mitchell was shocked. 'How dare he ask me to apologize? How could he not think about how humiliating it&rsquo;ll be if I apologize to a mere secretary?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, thinking of the Mitchell family's current situation, Louise Mitchell could only apologize humbly to the secretary before entering George Gregory's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she entered the office, Louise Mitchell complained grievously, "George, we&rsquo;ve been married for years. Shouldn't you spare me some dignity in front of others? What you did just now will only make the whole company know that the president's wife was asked to apologize to a secretary. I&rsquo;ll be humiliated.&rdquo;</p></div>
