        <h1>Chapter 4148</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina didn't expect Kit to show up in front of her voluntarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "How...how did you come here?" Tina looked around anxiously, afraid that someone nearby might see Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although Kit is wearing glasses, a baseball cap, and a mask, and is dressed in dark clothes, he is still quite noticeable in his university where there are many people and distractions. There's always a chance that one of his fans might recognize him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I have something to say..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Before he could finish his sentence, she reached out and grabbed his wrist, leading him in another direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit followed Tina's footsteps, feeling the warmth of her hand on his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It reminded him of that day after the drinking party, when Mr. Perkins slapped him and pushed him down onto the couch. She barged in and kicked Mr. Perkins to the ground, giving him a good beating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At that time, her hand had also held onto his wrist, helping him up and asking if he was okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He remembered how warm her hand felt...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Is it true that once someone who has experienced the cold of winter encounters warmth, they become greedy for more?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When they reached a secluded corner, Tina finally let go of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In that instant, Kit felt a sense of loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay, there aren't many people passing by here. It's relatively safe," Tina said, looking at Kit's face. However, because he was wearing a mask, she couldn't see his expression, "By the way, is your injury on your face healed? I saw in the news that you've been appearing in the media lately. Are you covering up the scars with makeup? Don't let the reporters find out, or who knows what kind of messy news they'll create."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She rambled on, with a tone of obvious concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Many people care about him, but most of it is just fake concern. Even though his manager and teammates show concern for him, it's mostly because of the many conflicts of interest involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But Tina is different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He can sense that she genuinely cares for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why do you care about me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina responded matter-of-factly, "Isn't it normal for fans to care about their idols?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Normal?" he frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, fans care a lot about their idols. They pay attention to their activities and naturally also pay attention to their physical well-being. Remember when you got injured during training before? Many fans came to the hospital to send their blessings and various gifts, hoping for your speedy recovery!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit looked at Tina, "Do you know all this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina felt a little embarrassed, "I also sent a gift at that time. I went to a temple and got a protective amulet. But I don't know if you received it or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit paused, he did remember the protective amulet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, among all those gifts, this one seemed insignificant, just a small flat box the size of a palm, as if it could be easily pushed into a corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When he saw the protective amulet, one of his teammates who had come to visit him even mocked, "Why did they give such a worthless protective amulet as a gift? Ah, I guess this fan must not have much money. These amulets only cost a few dollars at the temple!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But it's still a fan's heartfelt gesture." He had replied to his teammate in a formulaic tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although he remembered the lucky charm, in the end, he casually put it along with other gifts in the warehouse, to be used for a future charity event!</p></div>
