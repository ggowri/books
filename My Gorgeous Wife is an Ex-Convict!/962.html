        <h1>Chapter 961</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had almost lost control just now. As he was licking and kissing her fingers earlier, his lust only grew stronger and stronger. 'Almost... Almost&hellip; I almost had my way with her in the kitchen!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he had decided not to love her, even if they were now broken up, and even if he only called her Sis now, her influence over him was as strong as ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only looked at him with her almond-shaped eyes and it was enough for him to lose his soul. At that sight, all reason was thrown out the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me. How can I not love you..." His mutters rang in the silent bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I thought it was hard to love a person, but I fell in love with her so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I thought it was easy not to love someone, but... It's so hard&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace... Grace..." His hoarse voice cried out her name again and again as if it was the only name he knew&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went to work the next day, everyone in the firm looked at her differently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people came up to Grace to ask about her relationship with Brian, to which Grace replied, "I have nothing to do with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They approached her out of curiosity but left disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz looked at Grace, her teeth itching with envy. She thought Grace was dead meat yesterday and she would be fired from the firm. However, such a plot twist happened instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she could forget about kicking Grace out of the firm as many people were probably trying to get on her good side instead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the colleagues from yesterday who criticized Grace for being a homewrecker were now caring and attentive to Grace, looking for all sorts of topics to talk about with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz felt so depressed that she wanted to throw up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The trial starts in three days. Sort out the information." In the office, Lawyer Carter talked about what to look out for in court. Grace was already familiar with this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright," she replied. Then, she asked, "Lawyer Carter, is it really impossible to change the defendant for this case?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We don't have enough evidence. The court will look at the full chain of evidence, but the evidence we have is insufficient to form a good chain of evidence. You're a lawyer too. You should get it," said Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes darkened. 'Of course, I&rsquo;m aware.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that she hoped Baldwin could get compensation and good treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Otherwise, what's the point even if we win the case?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they were done talking about work, Lawyer Carter asked, "What's your relationship with Mr. Brian? Can you tell me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not answer Lawyer Carter the same way she answered her colleagues, so she said, "I have a cousin named Stella who's one of Mr. Hart's friends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter did not ask any more questions but talked more about the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace came out of the office, a text message ringtone rang on her phone. She took out her phone and saw that the text message was from Kyla, but the contents were clearly not written by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla: [Aunty, Mommy fainted.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately dialed the number, and it was Nelson who answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson, what happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aunty, Mommy fainted. What do I do?" There was a hint of sobbing in Nelson&rsquo;s childlike voice. After all, he was only four years old, so it was natural to be afraid of such situations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where's your grandmother?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandma... Grandma went out to buy groceries. I called her," said Nelson. He had wanted to call Grace, but his mother previously told him she was at work during the day and he could not call her, so he sent a text message instead.</p></div>
