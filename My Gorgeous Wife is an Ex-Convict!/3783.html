        <h1>Chapter 3781</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Veronica glared at Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better stay quiet now, Veronica. I don't want to harm you. I just want you to understand how incompatible you are with someone like Mason. We'll be at our destination soon, and when we get off the car, I'll give you back your phone!" Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica tightly pursed her lips. At this moment, she was locked in the car and couldn't get out. Her phone was with Daniel, and if she insisted on grabbing it now, it could lead to a car accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So arguing and fighting in the car was not a good plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only plan for now was to wait... and see what Daniel's next move was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Mason should have a general idea of what happened. With Mason's ability, he should be able to find her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, just thinking of Mason made her feel a sense of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if no matter what happened, he would come to protect her and she would be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica quieted down and just looked out the car window as the scenery passed by, memorizing the route. For now, it was better for her to avoid exciting Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about 10 more minutes, Daniel's car finally stopped, but to Veronica's surprise, he had parked at the parking lot of a famous mental hospital in Emerald City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you bring me here?" she asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To show you what kind of sins rich people can commit!" Daniel said as he took Veronica's hand and led her towards the hospital's ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he stood at the door of one of the rooms, he stopped for a moment before pushing it open and taking Veronica inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the room, a frail middle-aged woman was sitting on the bed, knitting, but her knitting was messy and it was impossible to tell what she was making.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Veronica approached, she noticed that both ends of the woman's knitting needles were thick and rounded. Was this to prevent the woman from injuring herself with the needles? Veronica wondered to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'm here," Daniel said. "And today, I brought Veronica with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman finally looked up and smiled at Daniel and Veronica. "Come closer, let Mom have a good look at you," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel led Veronica to the bedside, and the woman's gaze was fixed on Veronica. "Yes, you're Veronica. You're Veronica. Our Daniel has nothing left except for you. You must not abandon him. You must be with him. The embezzlement of public funds by his father has nothing to do with him. You can't blame him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more the woman spoke, the more agitated she became, and her voice gradually became incoherent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica frowned. Was this person... Daniel's mother? She had seen a family photo of him, his parents, and him before, and his mother had looked beautiful and gentle, giving her the impression of a graceful and virtuous wife and mother from a TV drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in front of her, she was in a hysterical state, and her face, although faintly resembling the one in the photo, had changed too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With gray hair and many wrinkles on her face, she looked like someone who had been tormented by life and had suffered too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Veronica doesn't want to break up with me. You don't have to worry about these things. And... Dad regrets what he did. He has been trying to make amends for these years," Daniel said.</span></p></div>
