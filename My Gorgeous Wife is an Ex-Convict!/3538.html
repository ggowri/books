        <h1>Chapter 3536</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even soon, they won't be in the same city anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, even if she hopes to bump into him on the street someday, it will become a luxury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a hand grabbed her shoulder, and she was pulled into a warm embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry, Veronica," Grace said. This child had been protecting Mason since she met her at the age of 7, watching over her small body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, now it was their own son who had caused the child so much sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Waaah!" Veronica suddenly burst into tears, as if she wanted to cry out all the pain she had been suppressing these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace held Veronica and repeatedly apologized, feeling sorry for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As time passed, Mason graduated from high school and went abroad to study, while Veronica also got accepted into a university in another city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She deliberately applied to a university outside of Emerald City, hoping to get away from all the hustle and bustle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe in an unfamiliar place, she can finally find some relaxation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Grace visited Veronica, her father and stepmother haven't come to force her to reconcile with Mason. Veronica doesn't know what the Reed family said, but it's still a good thing that they're not bothering her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Veronica boarded the high-speed train leaving Emerald City, she turned her head to take one last look at the hurried crowds behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps people will always pass each other by in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't know if she'll ever see Mason again in the future, but if she does, she hopes he'll be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And even if he forgets, the feelings they once had will always be cherished in her heart, carefully preserved and never forgotten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Goodbye, Mason!" Veronica said silently in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica chose to leave Emerald City, but it was also a way to say goodbye to everything in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Veronica left Emerald City, Grace and Jasper still kept in touch with her, often video calling her. Especially Grace, who cared about Veronica's life outside the city, which made Veronica feel warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper regretted Veronica leaving for school elsewhere and whispered to William, "There are many good schools in Emerald City. Veronica's college entrance exam scores were good enough to choose a school here. Why did she have to go elsewhere?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe for her, a change of environment would be better," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because of Mason's situation? But Mason has already gone abroad," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Emerald City has many places that Mason has been to, and she sees them every day. It's bound to be painful for her," William explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was taken aback and then asked, "Is Veronica not planning to come back to Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's something for the future, who knows?" William replied. "Maybe after she graduates from college, she'll come back. Don't think too much about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh," muttered Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The college entrance exam is coming up soon, you should focus more on your studies," William reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, which university are you planning to apply for in the college entrance exam?" Jasper asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stanford University," William replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was surprised, "You're planning to attend university in Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," he said. After four years of college, he didn't plan on being separated from her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But it's really a coincidence, I'm also planning to apply to Stanford University," Jasper said.</p></div>
