        <h1>Chapter 3865</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Along the way, some people recognized Jasper and looked at her curiously, wondering where she was going in such a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper didn't pay attention to these gazes, she just kept walking quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her footsteps stopped, and a familiar figure caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stopped in her tracks and gazed at Lawrence, who was wearing a white shirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young man in white was elegant and refined, just like the beautiful image she had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had fantasized many times about how they would reunite, but she never thought it would turn out like this. She never expected his revenge to be directed towards her family instead of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was best that she and Lawrence had never met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Lawrence also saw her and stopped in his tracks, staring straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their eyes met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper took a deep breath and walked towards Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked slightly surprised but stood still, waiting for her to approach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, she stood in front of him and asked, "I heard you dropped out of school and are planning to leave Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You seem to be well-informed," Lawrence sneered lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When are you leaving?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tomorrow," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where are you going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yemen," Lawrence said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yemen, it's really far away from here, one in the south and one in the north, it takes more than ten hours by plane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just because you escaped legal sanctions this time, doesn't mean you can do it again," Jasper said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He chuckled, "Is that why you came to talk to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I also want to tell you, don't commit any more crimes, whether it's for revenge or something else," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It really sounds like something a naive and ignorant young lady would say," Lawrence sneered, "But unfortunately, my life is decided by me, not by you telling me what to do or not to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, your life is decided by you, but the consequences may not be something you can bear," Jasper suddenly laughed, "Do you know why you can stand in front of me unscathed after what you did to Mason and the others? Do you really think the Reed family's reputation in Emerald City is just for show?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence narrowed his eyes, "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it weren't for the Reed family feeling indebted to you, you wouldn't be fine now," Jasper said, "So, I'm not the naive and ignorant rich girl you think I am. I know that there is a bright side and a dark side to this world. Although my family has always tried to protect me and keep me in the dark, it doesn't mean I really know nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence tightly pursed his lips and stared at Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, don't lay a hand on anyone from the Reed family again. Next time, you won't be so lucky, and I won't treat you like I used to!" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence suddenly took a step forward and approached Jasper, "Did you come to warn me about this today?"</p></div>
