        <h1>Chapter 2695</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People in the club knew Brian. They all respectfully called him Mr. Hart when they saw him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of the managers led the way to the entrance of a private room in the club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the door was pushed open, Valda Theller found that the private room was much bigger than she had imagined. It was about 200 square meters at first glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had a karaoke machine, pool tables, poker tables, and so on...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The men and women inside were fashionably and lavishly dressed. By comparison, Valda Theller was a little embarrassed. She felt like an ugly duckling among swans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the sight of Brian and Valda Theller's entrance, someone immediately whistled and said with a playful smile, "It's rare that you finally brought someone to our party after all these years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Brian had not had a woman around him for seven to eight years. Who could believe that this was the Hart family's heir, who had always been surrounded by girlfriends in the past?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, everyone knew that Brian used to have feelings for Jason's wife, Grace. It was not a secret. Even the netizens regarded it as gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you going to introduce her to us?" Patrick asked as he walked to Brian's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the closest to Brian among these people. He had witnessed how Brian and Jason fought over Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew better than anyone how much Brian loved Grace. It was also why he was so shocked to learn that Brian was bringing his girlfriend to the party today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My girlfriend, Valda Theller." Brian introduced and said to Valda Theller, "His name is Patrick. He's considered my childhood friend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Considered? We are childhood friends." Patrick smiled before stretching his hand to Valda Theller and saying, "Hello, I'm Patrick. If you want to know any humiliating stories about Brian when he was little, come look for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Influenced by his relaxed tone, Valda Theller was not as nervous as when she first came in. "Hello, I'm Valda Theller." She reached out her hand and shook his politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Brian introduced Valda Theller to some other people. Brian did not introduce her to the women there. Valda Theller knew that they must be plus ones that Brian&rsquo;s friends had brought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only introduced one woman&mdash;Phoebe Cross, the heiress of Song Yuan Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, I'm Phoebe Cross." She wore elaborate makeup. Though she was already 35 years old, she looked not more than 30 years old. She was wearing a delicate red dress that fit her figure perfectly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even a woman like Valda Theller admired Phoebe Cross's figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A woman like that easily became the center of attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, I'm Valda Theller," Valda Theller replied politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross stared at Valda Theller with her beautiful eyes and suddenly said, "I saw a viral post some time ago. It was about a comic artist with the same name as you, Miss Theller. She seems to have been involved in bullying and was later bullied by others during university. I wonder if it's true."</p></div>
