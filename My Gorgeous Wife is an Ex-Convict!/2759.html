        <h1>Chapter 2757</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They&rsquo;ll be elated if they find out." Patrick knew that Brian's parents would not interfere with Brian's marriage as long as he was willing to marry a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you come to see me about something?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did Patrick realize what he had come here for, but he was a little embarrassed to speak. "It's about Queenie Mack. I didn't want to bother with it at first, but her family makes a scene at my company every day and causes a lot of trouble, so I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want me to cut her some slack?" Brian asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That was the idea, but I don't think that&rsquo;ll happen now," said Patrick. Brian was serious about Valda Theller, so he would not go easy on Queenie Mack, who harmed Valda Theller on the film set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Huo family's plans were now in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's best if you don't have such ideas now. Since that woman dared to do such a thing in the first place, she should now suffer the consequences," Brian said indifferently. His dark phoenix eyes glimmered with malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's men had subdued the people who put Grace in the hospital that day. They also learned from those people that L City was full of rumors about Martin Weiss having an affair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had not made any statement about these rumors. It was as if he was planning to let people forget it with time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was not a celebrity, so it did not go viral but just spread in L City on a small scale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several people happened to recognize Kyla that day, so they wanted to make a video or get some special content to sell to Martin Weiss at a high price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they could not sell them, they could create some buzz online too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they did not expect the Reed family's mistress, Grace, to be with Kyla, let alone frighten her so much that she was hospitalized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was no use crying over spilled milk now. The Reed family had decided to sue them. The Reed family's legal team was nationally renowned. The lawsuit would inevitably cause them to give monetary compensation and take corresponding responsibilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace called Kyla and told her about Jason's findings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't Martin Weiss explain? We're divorced, so it's not an affair," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because he took someone else to the banquet before your divorce took effect?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even then, he could have argued against it with all sorts of other reasons so he wouldn&rsquo;t be called a cheater. Especially if he only attended it with a companion." Kyla was puzzled. It was a little far-fetched to call him a cheater when he only brought a companion to the banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps... there was something else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There must be something else. But this rumor only spread in L City on a small scale. The people that day had no idea too. They only heard he was having an affair. How about this? I'll ask Jay to look into it again," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks, I'll call Martin Weiss and ask him myself. I want to ask why he didn't make any statement to refute it," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," said Grace, knowing she did not want to bother her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, this was between Kyla and Martin Weiss. It was indeed inappropriate for her to interfere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I'm sorry about that day. I've put you in so much danger," Kyla said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't say that. The baby and I are fine now," Grace reassured. However, she would have to stay in bed until she gave birth. "Kyla, you'd better find out what happened to Martin Weiss as soon as possible, lest it affects your children."</p></div>
