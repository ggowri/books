        <h1>Chapter 1651</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Back then, Hadwin Stephenson could only rely on the Jackson family and me. I, Katherine Jackson, was the superior one. Hadwin Stephenson could only have a future because I chose him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had promised Hadwin Stephenson to save Lina but she also asked Hadwin Stephenson to break up with Lina to be with her instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe because he was not attracted to her, she wanted to conquer this man even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For the first time, she felt jealous of Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was jealous that the woman could occupy Hadwin Stephenson's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she saw that Hadwin Stephenson was turning to leave, Katherine Jackson suddenly raised her voice and said, "Hadwin Stephenson, do you think you can still be with Lina? You lost your shot to be with her five years ago!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's footsteps never paused. It was as if what she said did not affect him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson collapsed to the floor once the figure disappeared out of her sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if the Jackson family... could survive this, it would never be the same as before. What she could do was only slow down the Jackson family's downfall and leave them enough cushion to fall back on. She would find a way to turn things around in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, tomorrow... Tomorrow would be the day she got humiliated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson was furious at the thought of putting on a show to clear Lina's name! However, she could not escape this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's car slowly drove away from the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The driver in the front row asked, "Mr. Stephenson, do you want to go back to your residence first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson asked the driver to drive to the neighborhood Lina was staying temporarily in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The driver responded, and the car drove toward the direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson closed his eyes and leaned back on the chair, feeling weary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had always been weary. When he was a child, he had wearily learned everything he could just to win his father's favor and reassure his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As he was a bastard child, he needed to seize all the opportunities he could and hide his temper, joy, anger, and ambition...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he got a little wiser, he started walking on eggshells, thinking thrice before every step he took.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could only truly relax and let go of those deceptions and schemes in front of Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps the more calculating a man like him was, the more he was attracted to someone innocent and straightforward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was why he had fallen for her so quickly. He even searched for her all over the world when she left without saying goodbye!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... would he and Lina have a future together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was desperate five years ago, but was he not the same five years later?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just like what Katherine Jackson had said, he had lost his shot to be with her five years ago! Hadwin Stephenson gently looked down and stared at his hand for a long time until he fell into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The driver said, "Mr. Stephenson, we've arrived."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He realized they had now reached the neighborhood Lina was staying in.</p></div>
