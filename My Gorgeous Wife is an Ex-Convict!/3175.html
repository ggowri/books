        <h1>Chapter 3173</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Long time no see, how have you been?" After a while, Raymond murmured and spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As you can see now, it's not bad," Valda limped over to Raymond. "You're busy cleaning up the studio, so if you don't have anything important to do, please leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Raymond's gaze was fixed tightly on Valda's legs, "Your legs..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though I had already heard from the news that her leg was injured, knowing it is one thing, but actually seeing it is another thing altogether.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When I was in the water, I got injured and now I'm limping a bit," Valda said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hasn't he found a good specialist doctor to treat your injury?" Raymond asked. "If he hasn't arranged for a doctor to treat you, then I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Raymond!" Valda interrupted, "Brian is much more worried about my leg than you can imagine. I don't know why you're here today, but I think we have nothing left to talk about. So, could you please leave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I think we have nothing left to talk about.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her indifference made Raymond's heart ache. "Valda, I came here today just to see you, to make sure you're still alive and doing well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This year, she disappeared and he has been using his connections to search for her, but so far he hasn't found any leads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, it's already good enough that she can come back alive now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda heard Raymond's words and looked at him with a slightly less cold gaze. "So now you see that I'm doing well. Therefore, I ask that you don't appear in front of me again and disturb my life. Raymond, I told you a long time ago that we should go our separate ways and have nothing to do with each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused for a moment before continuing, "I hope you can understand and respect my decision. It's time for us to move on and focus on our own lives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Raymond looked at Valda with a hint of sadness in his eyes, but he knew that she was right. He nodded silently and turned to leave, knowing that this was the end of their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda watched him go, feeling a mix of emotions. She knew that it was for the best, but a part of her couldn't help but feel a sense of loss. She took a deep breath and reminded herself that she had made the right choice. It was time to move forward and embrace the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do we have nothing to do with each other?" Raymond smiled bitterly. "But I have always regretted that when you liked me, I used you, smeared your reputation, and even later, when you needed protection, I was indifferent. If I hadn't done that, maybe we wouldn't be like this now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you had never done those things, even if we weren't in the situation we are now, I think we still wouldn't have fallen in love," Valda paused for a moment and continued, "Because Raymond, you actually...don't love me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, Valda, I love you. I know I love you, even now my feelings for you are still strong!" He took a step forward and grabbed her wrist, his face showing pain and excitement. "Valda, please don't doubt my feelings for you, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda furrowed her brows slightly and looked at the other person, "I'm not doubting your feelings, I'm just being honest. Raymond, Raymond, you may have some feelings for me, perhaps out of guilt or regret, or maybe there was a moment of attraction at some point, but...these feelings are actually very shallow, so shallow that I don't even think they can be called love."</p></div>
