        <h1>Chapter 2900</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart furrowed his brow, his worry becoming more pronounced as he witnessed Valda Theller's face rapidly turning pale and her body trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you still want to take the subway back by yourself like this?" he asked, not unkindly, as he suddenly bent down and lifted Valda Theller up in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't..." she protested weakly, but it was no use. He had already picked her up and was walking towards the subway exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people on the subway turned their heads to look at them, making Valda Theller feel uneasy. If she struggled now, it would only attract more attention. So she buried her head in Brian Hart's arms like an ostrich.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart looked down at the person in his arms. She had become docile and gentle, no longer resisting being held by him, as if they had gone back to the way things used to be. If he could, he would have liked to hold her like this forever. But the memory of her pale face just now made him quicken his pace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In just two or three minutes, he had already carried her to his parked car. Opening the door, he placed her in the passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this point, not only was her face pale, but there was also a thin layer of sweat on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take you to the hospital. You don't look well," Brian Hart said, taking out a tissue and gently wiping the sweat from her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's body stiffened. His gentle actions made her feel complicated emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's okay... I just have a slight stomach ache. You can just take me home," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you're like this, you still don't want to go to the hospital? Besides, stomach pain can be serious or not," he said, leaning over to fasten her seatbelt before closing the passenger door and returning to the driver's seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart started the car and drove towards the hospital. Valda Theller placed her hand on her stomach, closed her eyes, and tightly pursed her lips, trying to suppress the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, she felt the car stop and heard the sound of the door opening. She slowly opened her eyes and saw that they were already in the hospital parking lot. Brian Hart had carried her out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can walk by myself," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, don't talk. It's faster if I carry you," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because it was already evening, Brian Hart carried Valda Theller directly to the emergency room. They quickly registered and waited in the outpatient waiting area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, there were only two patients ahead of them, so they didn't have to wait long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, you can see this doctor first. I'll call the hospital director and have him find some experts to come and take a look at you later," he said. Although he told her not to worry, his appearance at the moment seemed to show that he was more worried than she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was a little stunned. She only had a slight stomach ache. At most, she would just need some medicine. But he made it seem like she was seriously ill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially now, with the worry and nervousness in his eyes, it even gave her the illusion that he cared about her a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller, don't think too much! She reminded herself in her heart. Even if he really cared about her, his feelings were different from what she wanted. The person he really cared about was Grace!</p></div>
