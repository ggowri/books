        <h1>Chapter 2257</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for today. Nelson had a great time," said Kyla. She could see that her son was in a good mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's what a father is supposed to do. You don't need to thank me. I'm the one who owes Nelson too much," said Martin Weiss. After some hesitation, he added, "Kyla, what you saw the other day when you came to my office&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was tension in his voice as he said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she interrupted before he could finish. "You don't need to explain it to me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you're my wife, aren't you?" he asked as he looked at her intently. There was even an imploring look in his eyes. "Even if... we're going to get a divorce later on, you're still my wife right now. Shouldn't you find out what's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, what he said and the look in his eyes made it hard for her to retort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jacqueline Bowman came to me the other day and told me about what happened to you in prison. I... was so distracted that I didn't even notice her approaching me. The next thing I knew, you were already in the office," Martin Weiss said slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She might not want to hear what he had to say, but he still wanted to explain to her. He did not want her to get the wrong idea about him. He did not want that at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyelashes quivered slightly. 'Did Jacqueline Bowman talk to Martin Weiss about that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." Martin Weiss's voice was already a little choked up, and his eyes were slightly red. "I didn't know you had suffered so much. I deserve to die. I was terribly wrong!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What right did he have to ask her to stay with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said indifferently, "It's all in the past. I don't want to talk about what happened in prison. It's unnecessary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss smiled bitterly. 'Is it... because even hating me is unnecessary now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not love him or hate him. Perhaps she would only see him as a stranger after they divorced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, I'm always here if you need help with anything. I... can do anything for you," Martin Weiss said earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head. "You've done enough for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a car came and stopped at the store&rsquo;s entrance. It was Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper froze when he saw Martin Weiss. Then, he smiled and said hello to him. "Hello, Mr. Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss replied to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla greeted Chase Harper and made him a cup of tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper took the tea and drank it. Then, he carried the goods from the car into the store while Kyla checked the goods.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They talked about the goods, which made Martin Weiss feel like an outsider all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always been out of place in her world. He had tried to walk into her world all these years, but she had always rejected him coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she stood next to Chase Harper, she seemed relaxed as she talked and smiled casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss left the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he should not have high hopes. Perhaps he should accept everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He no longer held a place in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like what she said, his explanation was unnecessary.</p></div>
