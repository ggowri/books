        <h1>Chapter 190</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But no matter how much my qualifications grow, I still can&rsquo;t catch your eye, right?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In an instant, it seemed that something had been stuffed into Grace&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper gave a self-deprecating laugh immediately after. &ldquo;Actually, before you said those things, I had already thought of changing my job. After all, working in the Sanitation Service Center, you can predict the rest of your life with just one look. I want to take the chance while I&rsquo;m still not yet 30 to give myself more of a challenge.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A challenge? If the Grace from before had been given a choice of an unknown life full of challenges or a steady one that could be fully predicted with just one glance, she was afraid she would have chosen the former.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only after experiencing so many things did she know that stability was actually the most important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;Actually, what I said to you that day, you really don&rsquo;t have to mind it too much. I only didn&rsquo;t want you to spend more time on me. I don&rsquo;t have those kinds of feelings for you at all, so there&rsquo;s no way I can be with you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused, then enunciated every single word clearly, &ldquo;If I truly love you, then even if you are at rock-bottom, I will still choose to be with you. But since I don&rsquo;t, even if you soar above the ranks, I still won&rsquo;t be with you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Despair flashed across Chase Harper&rsquo;s face before he smiled. &ldquo;Is that so? When you put it that way, it&rsquo;s really as I thought&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t peg you wrong. I knew it. How can the person I like be so materialistic?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then are you still quitting?&rdquo; Grace did not want him to lose his stable job because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Going out into the world to try and make my mark is a wish I always had,&rdquo; Chase Harper said earnestly. His expression had no anger whatsoever. &ldquo;No matter whether or not I can succeed in the future, at least I won&rsquo;t have any regrets in this life, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Chase Harper&rsquo;s determined expression, Grace knew there would not be any use talking to him anymore, so she said, &ldquo;In that case&hellip; I wish you success.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace was about to leave, Chase Harper said, &ldquo;Grace, you&rsquo;re a good woman. It&rsquo;s my misfortune that I can&rsquo;t make you like me. I don&rsquo;t need any of your guilt either. My resignation has nothing to do with you. It&rsquo;s just my hope that I can provide a better life for the person I love in the future.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving Chase Harper, Grace felt like her heart was blocked. It was like an unspeakable uneasiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Chase Harper left the Sanitation Service Center. The Sanitation Service Center even organized a farewell party with everyone for Chase Harper. They had a meal out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace joined the meal too. After that, Chase Harper even paid from his own pocket and invited everyone to a karaoke session.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they parted ways, Chase Harper said, &ldquo;Grace, can you let me send you back this once? From now on, I won&rsquo;t have any chance to do so anymore.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace agreed. This time, she did not refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper&rsquo;s car was at the gates of the neighborhood. Grace got down and said to Chase Harper, &ldquo;See you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper hesitated a while before saying, &ldquo;See you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were two simple words, but they implied so much meaning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This chase was fated to have no results from the start, but at this moment, Chase Harper did not have any feelings of regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman lived a life that was much bumpier than he actually thought. Those kinds of highs and lows had few who could withstand it, but she was like the wintersweet flower after a harsh winter&mdash;no matter how devastating the winds were, in the end, her own fragrance would fill the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her beauty came inadvertently. It was not eye-catching, yet it was still so attractive. It was like being treated warmly by her could warm the soul too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, he really wanted to ask whether or not she already had someone she loved. If she did, then who was the person she loved?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know why, but when this question was at his throat, that man he met before who called her &lsquo;sis&rsquo; flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That man&rsquo;s attitude toward her did not seem like they were siblings. It was like they were lovers, not allowing others to get involved.</p></div>
