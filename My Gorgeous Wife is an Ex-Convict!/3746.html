        <h1>Chapter 3744</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason asked if she wanted him to send a driver to pick her up, but Veronica declined, saying that taking the subway was convenient enough. After ending the call, Veronica hurried to the subway station. When she arrived at the restaurant, she saw Mason sitting at a table, holding a coffee cup and sipping from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing casual navy blue clothes, and his demeanor was both casual and aloof. His silence often gave people a sense of loneliness, which was not a deliberate facade but something he had carried with him since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a lonely boat adrift on the sea, floating aimlessly without heading towards its own harbor. His world and that of others always seemed to be separated by a layer that could not be merged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had gradually integrated into the Reed family's life over the years, that sense of loneliness still lingered. She used to be the only person who could break into his world, but later, she walked out of it herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, can she still enter his world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Veronica was thinking this, suddenly, as if he noticed her gaze, Mason lifted </span><span>his eyes and looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, at this moment, Veronica felt that the loneliness on him seemed to be lessened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason!" She walked up to him with a smile and looked at the table. He hadn't ordered yet. "Why haven't you ordered anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not too late to order when you're here," Mason said, then called the waiter over and let Veronica order from the menu.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This restaurant is quite high-end, and the prices of the dishes on the menu are naturally not cheap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at the price of each dish and felt a little distressed, but she also knew that this money was nothing to Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ordering the dishes, just as Veronica was about to speak, her phone suddenly rang. She picked up the phone and saw that it was Daniel calling. She quickly answered, "Hello, this is Veronica." Her tone was completely formal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, sorry to bother you with a phone call. I have a little problem and forgot to ask you today..." Daniel said, and the question he asked on the phone was completely trivial. In Veronica's opinion, there was no need to call specifically to ask. He could just ask her tomorrow morning at the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Veronica answered Daniel's question carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Veronica," Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ending the call, Veronica looked up and saw Mason staring at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did you save Daniel's phone number in your phone? It's not the person I know with the same name and surname, is it?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today," Veronica replied. "Daniel is now my new colleague. He came to my brokerage company for his first day today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason furrowed his brow, "So, he's working at the same company as you now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's his position?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Same as mine, part-time assistant," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason pursed his lips. Daniel had already graduated from college, so there was no need for him to take on a part-time assistant job. Was there some other purpose behind Daniel taking this job?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason instinctively felt a dislike towards Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though his previous dislike towards Daniel was due to his relationship with Veronica, and the fact that Daniel was the person Veronica liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after hypnosis helped him forget his feelings for Veronica, his dislike towards Daniel remained indelible.</span></p></div>
