        <h1>Chapter 1301</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Did I say it wrong?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you call my mom... Mom?" she asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're already married. Your mother is my mother. Is it wrong for me to call her Mom?" he asked with amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was... nothing wrong with it, but she had always thought that the word &lsquo;Mom&rsquo; was taboo for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because his mother's existence had hurt him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Grace's eyes widening in shock and doubt, Jason sighed gently. He bent over to hug Grace and said, "I was once abandoned by my mother, so the word 'mother' had always represented hatred to me. I didn't think I'd ever call anyone 'Mom' again. But Grace... It was you who showed me that the word 'mother' still has warmth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He closed his eyes gently, rested his head on her shoulder, and told her things he never said to anyone. "Just like how you're a good mother, and your mother was a good mother too. That's why you miss her so much. She was the one who gave birth to you, and I'm very grateful. Without her, I would never have met you and would never understand what it feels like to love someone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace just felt that his breath seemed to surround her, and she seemed to have never been so close to him before&mdash;so close that he was taking the initiative to tell her about his trauma and his pain, little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So it's not just because we're married that I&rsquo;m calling your mother 'Mom.' More importantly, she's the mother of the woman I love the most. She's the one who gave you life, which tantamounts to giving me a second life. Grace, you're my second life," he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the tip of Grace's nose felt a little hot and sore. Her heart was moved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt sorry for the man. Her heart broke for him, and she... wanted to protect the man more and make him happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had felt this way before, and she felt it again... now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps this was what love was! She had always loved him and had never once gotten over him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I love you!" Grace whispered the words to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their love had been broken, but he pieced it together little by little. The cracks in it slowly disappeared and were replaced by a lost and found sense of cherishing and rejoice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She previously thought it would take a long time to get here, but it turned out to be so fast!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason immediately stiffened as if he dared not believe what he just heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is she talking about? Could I have misheard it? Is that possible?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... his heart hoped that he did not mishear it. 'Please don't let it be a mistake! I mustn't have misheard it! Because... that's my deepest desire!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason slowly straightened up. His ink-like eyes stared intently at Grace, and he said hoarsely, "What did you... just say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he finished asking, he waited almost breathlessly for her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had always been calm, he was extremely nervous right now as if he was facing a tense and difficult problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said I love you," Grace smiled and repeated what she had just said.</p></div>
