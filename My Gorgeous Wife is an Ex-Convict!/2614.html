        <h1>Chapter 2612</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace came to the bookstore to pick up some books and buy some stationery for Nelson. Kyla had gone to L City, and Mrs. Corbyn was taking care of the two children alone. As the two little ones' godmother, she was going to take better care of them during this period, of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of the three-month bet that Kyla had told her, she could not help but worry. She did not expect Kyla and Martin Weiss to make a deal like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three months. If Martin Weiss did not lift the hypnosis, it would be difficult to make Martin Weiss fall in love with Kyla again in only three months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should&rsquo;ve asked for more time, like three years or something." It was what she said to Kyla on the video call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I asked for three years, maybe he would just file for divorce. I think three months is as far as he can go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if he still insists on divorcing after three months?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then we&rsquo;ll get a divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you'll..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll raise Nelson and Trista myself. Maybe that&rsquo;s fate and we're not meant for each other, but I want to give my best in these three months so that I won't regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of Kyla's resoluteness during the call, Grace sighed to herself again. She went to the children's book section and selected a few books and some stationery. Just as she was about to pay, she saw Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes were looking around as if he was looking for something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt her gaze and looked toward her. He calmed down as those phoenix eyes gazed at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His glance instantly made her realize that he had probably been looking for her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a short pause, Brian strode toward Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There you are!" he said as he stood in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Were you looking for me?" she asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I passed the bookstore and saw your car outside, so I came in to try my luck," he said while glancing at the books and stationery in her hands. "Why did you buy these..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're for Nelson," she said as she walked toward the cash register.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian knew Nelson Corbyn, so he said nothing. He walked beside Grace and stared at her bulging belly. His eyes glimmered as if he was thinking of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace paid the bill and walked to the door, she said to Brian, "I gotta go if there's nothing else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" He could not help stopping her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She stopped and turned to look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you determined to have this child?" he asked in a murmur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled at that. "If there's a chance for this baby to be born safely, why won't I have them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But the price you&rsquo;ll pay for having them..." Brian could not help saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It won&rsquo;t cost me my life!" Grace interrupted him and said, "What I need to pay is only some physical damage, but what I'm getting is a new life. I think it's worth it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked blankly at the woman in front of him for a long while before murmuring, "If Jason were the one persuading you today, would you still insist on having the child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He wouldn't persuade me for this," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled bitterly. "It's because he understands you, right?"</p></div>
