        <h1>Chapter 239</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know," Evelyn said as she suppressed her insecurities. For now, the only way to find out was to ask Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must find out exactly what Grace's relationship with Brian was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace finished washing up that night and left the bathroom, she saw a light shining through a gap in the door that joined the two rooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was Jason&hellip; back?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought as she raised her hand to knock on the door. She wanted to talk to him about the driver issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she knocked on the door, it was not fully closed. Her knock opened the door, and she saw a large projection. It was obvious that there was a video conference taking place on the screen. There were many foreigners on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the people in the video conference were all looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's a woman. Oh my God, why is there a woman here so late at night?" someone said in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, is this your lover?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about an introduction?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This can't be the woman who called in the last meeting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All kinds of sounds filled the room for a moment until the room finally became quiet. Jason had cut off the sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could still see the people in the video conference looking at her curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes?" Jason asked as he turned to look at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Sorry for interrupting your meeting." She stood awkwardly, unaware that he was in the middle of a video conference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right," he said. "If you want anything from me, just say so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to ask the driver to fetch me to and from work tomorrow. I can take the bus myself," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? You take the bus with four wheels. The driver also sends you by car with four wheels. What's the difference?" He raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, it was different!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... too eye-catching," she hesitated and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought for a while before saying, "Which car did the driver pick you up in today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The silver Maybach," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I'll have a word with the driver later and get you an inconspicuous car," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately felt speechless. That was not the point at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What I was trying to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does Sis want me to send you personally?" Jason jumped to his feet and approached Grace. He bent over with a faint smile. His face was suddenly close to hers. "If that's what you want, so be it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face suddenly turned red. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught sight of the people in the video conference. They were all looking curiously at them while gossiping.</p></div>
