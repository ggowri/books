        <h1>Chapter 2397</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow smiled. "I've been cynical. It's indeed a blessing to be your friend, Mrs. Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should treat your friends the way you want to be treated. I'm willing to do so much for my friends because they had gone out of their way to help me back then," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow smiled. "Then I wish you good luck, Mrs. Reed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Grace. Then, she turned around and began looking for her target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had asked someone to look up Daley Moss's photos and basic information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unlike his mild-mannered older brother, Daley Moss was solemn and stern. He was tough, but he doted on his wife, Whitney Herrera, who was a popular celebrity when she was younger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to her marriage to the Moss family afterward, Whitney Herrera retired from acting and became the wife of a wealthy man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss and Whitney Herrera had remained deeply in love over the years. It was said that Daley Moss would calm down no matter how mad he was as long as Whitney Herrera consoled him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, Grace's real target was Whitney Herrera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had always been relatively easier for women to talk to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After spotting Whitney Herrera, Grace went over with a smile on her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera was chatting with several madams from the aristocratic families of Deer City. Grace approached Whitney Herrera and said, "Hello, you must be Whitney Herrera. My name is Grace, and I love your films. I didn't expect to see you at this party."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera sized up Grace and saw that she was dressed in this season's top luxury brands' couture. Even her gown cost more than ten million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The necklace around her neck was probably worth over a billion dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she had only borrowed the outfit, she would have to be someone capable to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello. I wonder what you do, Miss Cummins?" Whitney Herrera asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm a lawyer," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not look like a lawyer, but her profession intrigued the wealthy wives standing next to Whitney Herrera. After all, none of them were lawyers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people even curiously asked Grace some legal questions, and Grace answered them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rich women looked at Grace differently when they learned she was now married with three children and ran a law firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Whitney Herrera had a hint of approval in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera was also preparing for her comeback, wanting to restart her career. Therefore, she appreciated women like Grace, who could still do what she loved after marriage.</p></div>
