        <h1>Chapter 1810</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I'm not crying," said William as he turned his little head away with some embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your eyes are red," said Jasper Reed. Following the direction of William's face, she moved closer to him. Then, she reached out her hand and used her fingers to dab under his eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There were tears on her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her action was so sudden that he was caught off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Look, it&rsquo;s your tears!" She stuck out her little tongue and licked the tears from her fingers as she said, "It's salty!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's face turned even redder. He was a little flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why are you crying?" Jasper leaned her little head forward and asked, "Is it because your mommy is gone?" She heard her parents say William's mother had died in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Dying... means he'll never see her again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'That's what it meant on TV!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's little face was tense, and he was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper said grimly, "If my mommy's gone, I'd cry too. For many, many days! I won't laugh if you want to cry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I won't cry." William took a while to utter the words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper blinked and took two pieces of chocolate out of her pocket. "This chocolate is delicious. Every time I eat it, I won't feel sad anymore. Give it a try!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at the chocolate in her hand somewhat blankly. 'Did she come to my room at night to give me chocolate?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When aunt Cummins came back, he was given a separate bedroom. He had been sleeping alone in his new bedroom recently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know how hard this must be for you." As Jasper spoke, she peeled off the wrapper and held the chocolate to his mouth. "Ah!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She also demonstrated opening her mouth, hinting at him to open his mouth and eat the chocolate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, his little mouth was still pressed together tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Eat it. It's delicious!" she said as if wondering why he was keeping his mouth shut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He continued to press his lips together while she continued to hold the chocolate. For a moment, they seemed to be locked in a stalemate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a long while, he suddenly asked, "Why are you giving me chocolate? What does it matter if I'm upset?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We're friends. William, you&rsquo;re a very, very important friend of mine!" she answered matter-of-factly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Friends?' He bit his lip. They were not friends at all, nor could they ever be! He was nothing more than a toy to please her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she were upset, Uncle Reed would punish her! William's tiny body shuddered again at the thought of Uncle Reed's warnings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, don't you like chocolate?" Jasper Reed's small brows furrowed, and she looked like she was in a dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William hesitated a little before opening his mouth to eat the chocolate she was holding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The sweet taste instantly spread in his mouth, but he did not feel better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was just a toy. He could not make Jasper upset. He would suffer if Jasper was upset!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William kept his head down and ate the chocolate in silence. Suddenly, he heard sobbing noises. He looked up in confusion, only to find that Jasper Reed's face was full of tears.</p></div>
