        <h1>Chapter 1078</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart looked at his son's right hand that was still wrapped in gauze as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What a joke to get his wrist broken for a woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if I broke my wrist? As long as she can be found!" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Mr. Hart felt a surge of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Madam Hart immediately went up to comfort her husband and said to her son, "Don't make your father mad. Jason clearly treats that woman differently. Why would you meddle in this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the Reed family had a huge influence in Emerald City, the Hart family was not too bad either. Madam Hart was not afraid to go against the Reed family. In her opinion, it was only a woman and she was not the little girl with whom her son had been obsessed since childhood. There were many people who could take over her place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was never a shortage of beautiful women in the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My son can have any woman he wants. Why would he want a woman Jason won't let go?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what Brian said next stunned Madam Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, I have to meddle in this because I've fallen in love with Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What did you say?" Madam Hart looked surprised. It was the first time she ever heard her son say that he had fallen in love with a woman, even though he had many girlfriends before this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I love Grace so much that she's the only one I want! Therefore, I won't give in even if Jason won't let go!" Brian said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had let her go again and again. Now, he knew his heart better than ever! Therefore, he would not let her go again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The one person he wanted to spend the rest of his life with was... Grace and only Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart glared at his son. "What did you say? Come again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I love Grace. I won't let go even if I have to face Jason!" Brian said adamantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart snapped. "Are you insane? Are you going to fight against the Reed family for a woman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no idea what position the woman held in Jason's heart, but from the fact that Jason broke the hand of a member of the Hart family for a woman, he could see that this woman was probably important to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Of course, Brian's hand wouldn't be broken in vain. Since Jason dared to break it, then the Hart family will have the Reed family pay the price!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that did not mean Mr. Hart would like to see his son compete with Jason for a woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, the entire Emerald City would bear witness to a huge joke!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled lightly. "If I give up just like that, then I think I&rsquo;d really be insane."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would be insane with regret!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to regret it again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no idea how long Jason planned to keep her here. Besides, Jason had taken her phone away and she did not have a way to communicate with the outside world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did say he had helped her ask for leave from the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, about Lina and Kyla&hellip;' The thought of Lina possibly worrying about her and Kyla's case bothered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had been three days. She and Jason were still stuck together.</p></div>
