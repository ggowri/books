        <h1>Chapter 1049</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With delicate makeup on, Grace looked just like a socialite from tMason Swansonty in the gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Stella had been working hard on her appearance. She had good makeup artists to do her makeup and style her, but there were still people taunting her for being a country bumpkin behind her back. It was as if there were things that no amount of money could cover up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is there such a huge difference? We looked similar when we were little, and sometimes people would even mistake us for twins when we went out! If it hadn't been for that, I wouldn't have been able to fool Brian with photos of me as a child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, I looked less and less like Grace as I grew up! Grace became more and more beautiful while I became more and more common. My eyes aren't as big as Grace's. My nose bridge isn't as straight as Grace's. Even my skin isn't as fair as hers!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's hatred grew at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't I come here with him?" Grace found it funny and asked her cousin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked as if she had robbed her of something. It was as if she was a robber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, who was the robber here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people would claim the thing they robbed as their own once they had it for a long time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was stunned. Out of the corners of her eyes, she caught a glimpse of Brian's slightly darkened face. She suddenly shuddered and came back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace has gotten her memory back, after all. If I provoke her into telling the truth, I... I have a pretty good idea of how I would respond to make Brian think Grace is lying, but... it's a lot of trouble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Especially now that Brian is in love with Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella smiled lamely and said to Grace, "It's not that. I... I was just surprised. After all, when I mentioned the charity gala to Brian, Brian said he had an important business deal to handle tonight and didn't have time to attend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned, not realizing that Brian already had plans for the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she asked him to bring her here, he had said yes without any hesitation! Grace felt heavy-hearted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed as if she was owing him more and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart." Stella's manager came over and said hi to Brian, the man who was supposed to have something to do today. It was because of this that he brought Stella to the gala to meet some people in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was important for an artist to expand their connections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Show Stella around," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Stella approached Brian and made a gesture to take his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian leaned slightly to avoid Stella's hand and she failed to take his arm. Stella immediately looked embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Brian, why don't you show me around and meet some people with me? I'll feel better if you accompany me." Stella feigned nervousness. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not bother to watch Stella pretend and turned her head to look around. She suddenly trembled when she saw the people she wanted to see tonight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels. 'There they are!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurriedly said to Brian, "I see the people I'm looking for." Then, she walked in Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels's direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Grace's back view as she took hurried steps, Brian suddenly felt a sense of loss.</p></div>
