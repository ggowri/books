        <h1>Chapter 2148</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss stiffened instantly, and a rising fear spread through his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not budge. Instead, he said, "You won't kill yourself. You still have Nelson and your mother. Are you willing to leave them for the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">You could say that this remark had hit her in her weak spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla quivered. The scalpel in her hand seemed to weigh more than a thousand pounds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Yes, she could not bear to leave Nelson and her mother. The man in front of her seemed to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla suddenly smiled, but her eyes were full of tears. "Martin Weiss, you said you want me to believe that you love me. Is this what your love for me is? You didn't ask me whether I'm willing to do it. You decided everything yourself. The country gave me the right to decide whether I want to give birth, but you want to take that away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was sarcasm in her voice, and she looked at him with a chill that was never there before. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss felt as if the chill would freeze the blood in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I&rsquo;m just afraid something will happen to you. I just&mdash;" He wanted to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she interrupted him sharply. "You're forcing me to have an operation because you're afraid that something will happen to me. You only love yourself. You only care about your own feelings, but you&rsquo;ve never cared about mine. Martin Weiss, what is the difference between what you're doing now and when you forced me to go to prison? Just because you're more powerful than me, you think you can easily change my life and treat me as an object!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she said flustered him. His face turned pale, and he staggered toward her. "No, Kyla. It's not what you think!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said sarcastically, "You have nothing to explain. Whether it's what I think or not, I can feel and see it for myself. Do you remember when you forced me to apologize to Paisley Daniels by pressing my head? You made me kowtow and admit it was my fault again and again? I had never hated anyone so much back then. I hate you more than I hate Paisley Daniels!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He felt that every step he took toward her was difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her words pierced him like the sharpest sword!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her voice continued to ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then, you willingly donated me your liver. You admitted your mistake and brought Paisley Daniels to justice. My hatred slowly faded. I thought we could live in peace for the rest of our lives. But now, you're forcing me to hate you again. Martin Weiss, it turns out we'll only end up with me hating you. It's never going to be okay between us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she spoke, she suddenly tossed the scalpel in front of him. "You're right. I dare not threaten you with my life because I still have Nelson and my mother. But Martin Weiss, don't say anything disgusting like wanting me to believe that you love me from now on. There can be nothing but hate between you and me. There can never be love!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The look in her eyes was gray when she gave up all resistance. Then, she closed them as if looking at him any longer would dirty her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss almost stumbled over to Kyla and hugged her hard. "Kyla, don't do this. Please, don't do this to me. I love you. It's true. It has always been true!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Kyla stayed silent. She kept her eyes closed as if she was pretending to be a puppet.</p></div>
