        <h1>Chapter 1159</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn clenched her teeth as she walked into the suite and closed the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss walked to the couch and sat down. He picked up a cup of tea on the coffee table and sipped it gently. "What do you want to talk about? You're not asking me to give up custody, are you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's eyes glimmered. "What if I am? Can you give it up? As long as you give up Nelson's custody, I'll do anything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll do anything?" asked Martin Weiss as he looked up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" she answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think I need you to do for me now?" Martin Weiss said as if he found it funny. "Give birth to a child to compensate Paisley? But we already have Nelson, or do you want to do something else? What can a food stall owner like you do for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's face turned pale. She had nothing she could use to beg him with!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was nothing she could offer him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a long silence before she said, "Don't you... hate me? You hate that my father gave the Weiss family trouble and almost destroyed the Weiss family. Therefore, you deliberately approached me to get revenge. If you think it's not enough, you can continue with your revenge. You can hurt me however you like. It doesn't matter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only wanted him to let Nelson stay with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was her everything and her spiritual support. If she lost Nelson, then life would truly be dark for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared coldly at the person in front of him. This woman's father had almost ruined the Weiss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he found the man, he had already died ten years ago, and he could only take his revenge on this woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no one knew who was the victim in that revenge of love! He had even thought about it countless times. If he had not chosen such a way, would he not have carved that woman Kyla Corbyn so deeply into his heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Revenge? He sneered. "Taking my son away from you will probably be the best revenge."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn trembled. She seemed to be on the verge of collapsing. Her somewhat pale lips quivered slightly, and her bright eyes seemed to be filled with some despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned slightly. Looking at the way she looked, he felt out of breath as if his chest was being weighed down by something heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene of her setting up her food stall recurred to him. Back then when he saw her cooking noodles and other dishes at the humble food stall in cheap clothes and an apron, his chest had also felt so heavy that he was almost breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all these years, the woman could still influence him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really going to fight me for Nelson&rsquo;s custody?" Kyla Corbyn spoke slowly after a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should have thought of that before, shouldn't you? How can I let my child grow up with a criminal?" Martin Weiss said, pulling no punches.</p></div>
