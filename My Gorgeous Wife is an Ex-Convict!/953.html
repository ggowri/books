        <h1>Chapter 952</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the woman they deemed as worthless had Emerald City's most dangerous man as her backer now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row had been on edge for the past two days, especially after Zoe's video came out. He could not even sleep at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He remembered Zoe insulting Grace at the banquet the other day, and then... this happened to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the Stevens family was rich and powerful. The Lambert family was only rich at most, so they were still incomparable to the Stevens family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With what was happening to Zoe, he would only end up worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had kept Grace standing at the pool table for a long time that day. Grace even seemed to be limping when she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Curtis Row could imagine getting his legs broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Curtis Row rushed to buy thousands of yellow roses as an apology and sent them to Grace's office. He also prepared an expensive gift and went to Grace's office to apologize sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone was stunned when Curtis Row showed up at the firm. Yellow roses could be seen everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz was excited. 'Curtis Row's appearance is hard evidence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace seems to be hooking up with Curtis Row. That's why there are always luxury cars picking her up!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz quickly took out her phone and secretly filmed Curtis Row and Grace together. Then, she secretly uploaded it to the internet and tagged Curtis Row's current real girlfriend&mdash;a starlet named You Keer who often quarreled with people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz was in a good mood after doing all this. Now, she just had to wait for You Keer to give Grace trouble. When that happened, the firm would definitely fire Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If such a scandal went viral online, no firm would hire Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A lawyer's career was over when their reputation was ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Andrea Schwartz could not hear what the two were saying because of the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she did not dare to move forward because when Curtis Row came, he made it clear that he wanted to talk to Grace alone for a few minutes. The two of them walked to a corner on the other side of the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz could only see Curtis Row taking out a box and trying to give it to Grace, but it was pushed away by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A colleague walked up to Andrea Schwartz and muttered, "What on earth are they talking about?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who knows? It's probably just a conversation between a homewrecker and her lover," said Andrea Schwartz.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Curtis Row has a girlfriend. Grace is so shameless to be the other woman. She's disgracing our firm. Others will think that all our lawyers are homewreckers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another colleague chimed in, "I know, right? People like her shouldn't be here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's report this to the higher-ups. If she stays, our reputation will be ruined!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz was secretly pleased as more colleagues continued to join the conversation.</p></div>
