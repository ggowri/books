        <h1>Chapter 2028</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina immediately looked embarrassed. "I... I was just saying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just saying?" Hadwin Stephenson tugged at his tie. "Then why don't you tell us how these two actors are your cup of tea?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was immediately at a loss for words. Whatever she said turned out to be the wrong thing. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace quickly smoothed things over. "Alright, alright, let's order first. We're all hungry. We can't let Lina starve!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, let's order. Let's order!" Lina said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, the two women took the menu and huddled together to start ordering. Meanwhile, the two men looked at their own women with different expressions on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before long, the food Lina and Grace ordered was served.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The four began to eat, and Jason was halfway through his meal when he suddenly said, "Why do you women like to watch TV shows where two men fall in love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Huh?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina and Grace looked at each other. Finally, Grace replied, "It's not that we like to watch TV shows like that. It's just that they happen to be TV shows we like. In my opinion, such shows express that love is more about the person than anything else. Even if people around you look at you differently, the feeling will never change."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really? It&rsquo;s not because of the two men's looks?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Poof!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina almost spewed out the food she had not swallowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was also speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Well, the actors' looks do help, of course!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well, those with better looks are more pleasing to the eye when put together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So..." Jason suddenly got up, pushed his chair away, and walked to Hadwin Stephenson as he glanced over the two women. "Do you find it pleasing to the eyes if Hadwin and I do this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said as he pressed one hand on Hadwin Stephenson's shoulder. Then, he slowly leaned over as his face inched closer to Hadwin Stephenson&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson froze for a while. He seemed to realize something and looked slightly sideways at Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two men just stared at each other as their two handsome faces came closer and closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Lina instantly widened their eyes, their faces full of shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Gosh..." A low cry escaped Lina's mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'That's so... you know... Hadwin Stephenson looks slightly feminine, while Jason looked indifferent and handsome. But those peach blossom eyes of his are so gorgeous.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two men were in such an amorous pose that provoked others' imagination. The impact was also nothing the two rookie actors in the TV show could compare with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina felt as if she was about to have a nose bleed. She watched their faces get closer and closer till their lips were close to touching. She immediately leaned forward and tugged Hadwin Stephenson sideways, pulling Hadwin Stephenson and Jason slightly apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Uh... You... You don't need to make it pleasing to the eyes. That's enough. That's enough..." Lina said quickly, feeling as if she was about to lose her future husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, Jason's face was so stunning that he could attract both men and women!</p></div>
