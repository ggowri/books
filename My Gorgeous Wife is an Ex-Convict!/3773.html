        <h1>Chapter 3771</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica and Mason were browsing the stalls in the school. The various small items were indeed very attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Veronica clearly felt that walking with Mason attracted a lot of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially in the campus, the attention was even more exaggerated than on the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you very famous in school?" Veronica couldn't help asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I just came as an exchange student this semester. I don't know many people in school," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica wanted to say that just because he didn't know many people didn't mean that many people didn't know him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking about it, Mason was the Mason of the Reed family, and Jasper was also at Stanford University. Naturally, when Mason came to Stanford University, many people probably already knew him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that person is now her boyfriend, and it's quite an honor for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still haven't decided what to buy?" Mason asked. "How about clothes or shoes? Anything visible, just buy two identical ones?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." How much stuff would they have to buy then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Veronica saw a small booth selling handmade trinkets and became interested, so she walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I help you with something?" The vendor, a girl, asked eagerly when she saw Veronica approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just looking." Veronica replied, and began to look at the trinkets. There were hair clips, bracelets, and hairpins, but some of them suited her better than Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have anything that can be used by both men and women?" She asked. She quite liked the handmade trinkets at this booth, unlike the ones that could be found everywhere online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These phone charms can be used by both men and women." The girl replied warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's eyes lit up. Yes, phones are something that people use every day, so they would see the charm every day. If they both took out their phones with the same charm in public, people would know they were a couple without explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Veronica began to look for phone charms. After a while, she chose a leather cat paw charm and asked the person next to her, "Mason, what do you think of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was originally facing away from the booth, texting Jasper on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper had sent a message asking if they were free for lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Veronica's voice, Mason turned to look at the cat paw charm in her hand and said, "It's pretty cute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl running the booth was surprised to see Mason and stared at him with wide eyes. She never expected the campus heartthrob to be standing in front of her booth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... does Mr. Reed have any preferences?" The girl asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, even if she had to give it away for free, she would be willing to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have two of these cat paw pendants that are the same?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes!" the girl quickly replied, pulling out a cat paw pendant identical to the one Veronica was holding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it?" Mason asked Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica nodded, "It feels pretty good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's take these two," Mason said, then turned to the girl at the booth and asked, "How much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl gave a number, and Mason scanned the QR code on the booth with his phone to pay. Veronica hung one of the pendants on her phone and then said to Mason, "What about your phone? Let me hang it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Mason handed his phone to Veronica without objection.</span></p></div>
