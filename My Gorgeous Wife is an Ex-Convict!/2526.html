        <h1>Chapter 2524</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had his heart died?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it was still beating, each beat seemed to bring a fit of sharp pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was worse than death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After learning the verdict of the case, Grace called Amber Mitchell to comfort her. However, Mitchell did not sound upset in the phone call. Instead, she said confidently, "Louise Mitchell won't get away so easily. I&rsquo;ll let the law punish her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there new progress with Herman Moss's car accident case?" Grace speculated because Amber Mitchell had told her that Louise Mitchell had something to do with the accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell replied, "Yeah, there&rsquo;s some progress. the Moss family has also sent someone to keep an eye on Louise Mitchell to prevent her from escaping."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good," said Grace. She did not want to see someone like Louise Mitchell get away with murder either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, how are you doing? How's the baby? Is everything okay?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Everything's fine. I just have to get more rest," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good. I'll come to Emerald City to see you when the matter with Louise Mitchell is over," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll wait for you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call, she raised her hand and caressed her belly. What she did not tell Amber Mitchell was that everything was unconfirmed. They could only decide after seeing the placenta's growth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the situation was bad, they might not be able to keep the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you worried about the baby again?" Jason came over and knew what Grace was worried about as soon as he saw the look on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded gently. "Yeah. I hope there won't be any problems when the baby grows their placenta."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Alright, don't overthink it. No matter what the problem is, we'll face it together. Grace, I just want you to remember that all I want is for you to be safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything else was the next best thing. All he wanted was for her to be safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gazed intently at Jason. His beautiful peach blossom eyes were full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The worry in his eyes somehow increased, and she knew it was all because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her hand to caress his eyebrows. "Don't worry. I&rsquo;ll be safe. Aren't we going to grow old together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew better than anyone what would happen to this man if anything happened to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her life was not only hers. It was also his!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason held Grace. "You promised me that we'll grow old together. You can't go back on your word."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I won't go back on my word," she said gently as she leaned in his arms and listened to his heartbeat. Little by little, her anxiety seemed to dissipate. "By the way, do you know how Martin Weiss is doing now?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla and Martin Weiss's youngest daughter, Trista, would be discharged from the neonatal care unit next week. She could return to Kyla's side if everything went well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss had never once visited Trista in the hospital, nor did he contact them. It was just like what he said before this. He wanted a clean separation.</p></div>
