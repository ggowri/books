        <h1>Chapter 1735</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The secretary gently closed the office door, speculating that this woman would probably be the mistress of Stephenson Group someday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, even when he was dating the heiress of the Jackson family, he had never once allowed Miss Jackson to enter his office as he wished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides... the secretary had also seen the news about the president and Miss Sweeney! All the employees could see that this woman held a different place in their boss' heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina walked into the office, only to see Hadwin Stephenson lying on the couch. He was covered with a thin blanket and seemed to be resting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She instantly wondered if she should breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He's asleep. At least I don't have to talk to him. I'll just leave the clothes here. It'll still count as me returning them myself!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She gently put the clothes in her hand on the coffee table and was about to leave, but her eyes could not help falling on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was sleeping. His beautiful eyes were closed, and his long shadows cast shadows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She still remembered how she had liked to gently poke and touch his face when he slept beside her. She had said that she was taking advantage of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She would even do silly poses and take photos with him while he was asleep and laugh at them afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Our past... was wonderful. It was like the best dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But we all have to wake up from our dreams, don't we?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Even if those eyes are looking at me. Looking... at me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina instantly came to her senses. She realized Hadwin Stephenson had already opened his eyes. What was even more embarrassing was that her fingers had somehow reached over to touch his cheek. She was pinching him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Gosh, that's why we should get rid of bad habits!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina wanted to withdraw her hand, but Hadwin Stephenson seized it first. "Are you going to harass me even when I'm asleep?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No... No..." Her face went red instantly. "I just wanted to return the clothes from last time. They... They've been dry-cleaned, and because I used to do that when you were asleep, so... Uh... It's just a habit of mine... Uh, no..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina only thought she had made things worse. She did not even know what she was talking about anymore. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson sat up and raised his long arm, pulling Lina into his arms. "So you've kept that habit all these years, have you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, let go of me!" Lina struggled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her strength was nothing to him. He held her tighter instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, I've always been your habit, haven't I? No matter how many years have passed, those habits are still there," muttered Hadwin Stephenson as he buried his face in Lina's neck, taking in her scent. "You're my habit too. I can't get rid of you after so many years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It seemed that only by holding her like this and taking in her scent could he stop feeling lonely and be at ease.</p></div>
