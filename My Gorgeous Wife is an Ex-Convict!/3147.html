        <h1>Chapter 3145</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian returned, he saw Valda looking at her phone with a serious expression. "What's wrong? What are you looking at?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, just browsing casually," Valda said, turning off her phone and setting it aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Brian picked up his phone and turned on the screen. Suddenly, the webpage that Valda had been browsing appeared before his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is about the Tracy incident, and there are various comments attacking both him and Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was careless and gave the Barlow family a chance to retaliate. The public opinion may not be easily suppressed for a while, but I will settle this matter within three days. For now, you can come and stay at my place for a few days to avoid any inconvenience caused by someone breaking in here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda considered for a moment, nodded and said, "Okay, I'll stay at your place for now. Let me pack my things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll pack for you." He gently pushed her onto the chair. "I know exactly what you need to bring, so if there's anything I missed, just remind me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only those who truly understand each other can confidently say these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Valda watched Brian pack her things, she felt a sweet sensation in her heart. Her previous bad mood caused by reading negative comments seemed to have improved a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought that as long as he was by her side, she could face any difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she saw Brian open one of the drawers, her face turned red in an instant. She quickly rushed to the drawer and pulled his hand away, blocking the way to the drawer. "It's okay, I'll tidy it up myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian raised his eyebrows slightly, "It's no problem for me to help you tidy up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I...I can do it myself," she stuttered, her face turning bright red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her flushed cheeks, "What, are you feeling shy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course she was feeling shy! She muttered to herself in her mind, all of her underwear was in this drawer. If she let him tidy up, wouldn't that mean he would see all of them...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, she pursed her lips and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at Valda and felt that her current appearance was extremely cute, which suddenly gave him an impulse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He slowly leaned down and kissed her cheek gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tender kiss made Valda stunned for a moment and she couldn't react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you...suddenly kiss me?" she asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I couldn't help but kiss you because I find you very cute," he whispered, his voice husky with desire. "Valda, do you know how cute you are in my eyes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face immediately turned even redder. Oh my, it felt like he was getting better and better at sweet-talking her. Every time he spoke, she couldn't help but feel her heart skip a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I've organized my things. Don't...don't look yet," she hesitated for a moment before blurting out these words. Then she turned around and began staring at the drawer behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I'm afraid that if I keep looking at him like this, her face will turn so red that blood will start oozing out.</p></div>
