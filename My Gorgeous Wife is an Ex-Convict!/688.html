        <h1>Chapter 687</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man uttered a series of words, all in defense of Lily. He behaved just like a fan of Lily&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned a little, picked up a couple of books she had chosen, and went over to the cashier to pay for them. She planned to look for Lina after paying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the man did not give up and continued to follow Grace. He went on with his speech, wanting Grace to declare online that she was willing to forgive Lily and even took out his phone to film her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned more deeply. "You have no right to film me without my consent!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You feel guilty, don't you? I'm just filming with my phone. What's that got to do with you? You haven't publicly responded to Lily's apology. You don't have a secret, do you? Is it possible that you want to rekindle your relationship with Sean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man exaggerated as if to spur some hot gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurriedly paid the bill. She was hoping to find Lina, but more and more people had gathered around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, because of what the stranger said, the people around her now knew who she was even if they had not recognized her at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Lily's apology was also a hot topic on the internet these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is she the Grace who had her case reversed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a pity. She spent three years in prison in vain and lost her rich boyfriend. She must have thought of killing herself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought a woman who could compete against Lily for a man would be dazzlingly beautiful, but she just seems all right!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People around her started exchanging opinions with each other. Many even pulled out their phones and started filming Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw that the crowd was growing and was afraid that looking for her best friend now would only drag Lina into the fray.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she thought about it and walked straight to the exit of the bookstore. She planned to get out of here first before calling her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as she rushed out of the bookstore, the man who first recognized Grace got a bit impatient and reached out to grab her. "Don't go. You haven't answered my question! Are you trying to sabotage Lily and Sean's relationship? Do you have a skeleton in your closet? Otherwise, you could just answer openly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace subconsciously stepped to the side to avoid the man's hand, but unexpectedly, the man came charging faster than she expected. The man was about to grab her arm, but in the next moment, the man's wrist was grabbed by another hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a beautiful hand&mdash;Slender, fair, and had well-defined joints.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace remembered seeing only a few men with such beautiful hands, and according to her memory, the owner of this hand was&hellip; Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up and immediately caught sight of Brian's handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Brian just twisted the man's arm and pushed him to the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" The man let out a piercing shriek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone in the crowd recognized Brian. "It's the crown prince! It's the crown prince of the Hart familyHart family!"</p></div>
