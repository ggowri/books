        <h1>Chapter 1377</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost with difficulty, she raised her hand and touched his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The familiar face she had touched and marveled at so many times before seemed strange to touch now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From her initial agitation after seeing the news to being able to calmly hear him say these words, was it because... she had prepared herself mentally before he came?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, then... we have... nothing to do with each other... from now on," she murmured, her fingers resting lightly on his lips. "Hadwin Stephenson... I... hope you'll get what you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to... break up in tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want them to switch from being lovers to enemies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they broke up or no longer loved each other, she still wanted them to be amicable with each other. After all, he was a man she loved sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not afford to give him what he wanted, and his love for her weighed far less than what he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body was stiff. She could calmly tell him these without crying nor making a scene. She was even approaching it politely. This was the best result he could have imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why did he seem to feel as though his body was being torn apart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Get what I want... I'll never really get what I want!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that his life would be in eternal darkness when he chose Katherine Jackson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels looked at the report in her hand with an unpleasant expression. 'I'm... pregnant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How is that possible?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had previously pretended to be pregnant because it was difficult for her body to conceive. She then schemed to fall down the stairs and pretended to have suffered a miscarriage. It was her best excuse to say that she would have difficulty conceiving in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This not only helped her deal with Kyla Corbyn but she also managed to push the blame for her inability to get pregnant to Kyla Corbyn. At the same time, it made Martin feel sorry for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But now I'm pregnant? But it isn't Martin's child! It's that damn Shane Currey's!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's heart was full of hatred at the thought of this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The day she gave Shane Currey 50 million dollars, she had drunk with him. Before she could realize it, she became drunk and got very dizzy. She ended up sleeping with Shane Currey after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all right as long as she and Shane Currey did not tell anyone. Then no one would ever know!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the fact that she was pregnant made her confused!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Daniels family was in turmoil because of Paisley Daniels's pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the wedding between their family and the Weiss family was about to take place. Nothing could go wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't we just pretend that this child is Martin Weiss's? Just tell him you're pregnant with his child. At least the child will be yours," said Mrs. Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" Paisley Daniels rejected firmly. "Martin isn&rsquo;t a fool. If I really give birth to this child, it&rsquo;ll be the most direct proof of my wrongdoings! I can't get rid of it even if I want to by then!"</p></div>
