        <h1>Chapter 1001</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Luckily, Lina soon changed the topic and did not continue talking about Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the meal, Hadwin Stephenson drove Grace back to the rental house before sending Kyla Corbyn and Nelson home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the little one got out of the car, Lina gave him another kiss before waving him goodbye. She also said she would give the little one a gift when he was officially admitted to the kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Lina who was reluctantly saying goodbye to the little one, Hadwin Stephenson stepped on the accelerator and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, I'm not done talking!" grumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't know you were fond of children," Hadwin Stephenson said sulkily. He calculated that she had kissed Nelson seven or eight times today. She had never even kissed him that many times in one day before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm caring!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson just wanted to roll his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Doesn't he make your heart ache with pity?" Lina shrugged. "I heard from Grace that he was born in prison. And he was born deaf too. It must&rsquo;ve been hard for Kyla Corbyn to raise him so well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could not help but admire Kyla Corbyn at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She probably could not do it if it were her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Prison?" Hadwin Stephenson was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson's father is Martin Weiss," said Lina. She only found out when she went to Grace's rental house and came across a copy of Kyla Corbyn's trial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was shocked. "Martin Weiss? Martin Weiss from the Weiss family in S city?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina curled her lips and sneered, "Isn't it unbelievable? Martin Weiss's so rich, but his child was born in prison. He&rsquo;s even having trouble getting into a normal kindergarten."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could not help but feel sorry for Nelson and Kyla Corbyn because of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This pair of mother and son had indeed suffered too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson bit his lip slightly. "Everything happens for a reason." He did not want to comment too much about other people's business. Besides, he did not understand Martin Weiss and Kyla Corbyn's dispute at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina grumbled, "To put it bluntly, he's just a heartbreaker! He would rather believe that goody-two-shoes and put his former girlfriend in jail without mercy. I was f*cking pissed when I heard that he's going to fight for Nelson&rsquo;s custody."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina cursed right away. If Martin Weiss were here, she would probably curse him until kingdom come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, don't think too much about other people's business," said Hadwin Stephenson as they arrived at Lina's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina unbuckled her seat belt but did not get off immediately. Instead, she turned to look at Hadwin Stephenson and said, "Let's not have any misunderstandings between us, alright? You must always take my word for it."</p></div>
