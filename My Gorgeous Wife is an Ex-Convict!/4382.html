        <h1>Chapter 4380 The Desire to Climb Higher</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After parting ways with Harley, Calvert returned to his residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his living situation had changed from the past. It was no longer a dark and dirty environment, but rather a decent single-person apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his original expectations, he thought it would take several years after graduation before he could live in a house like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, it happened several years ahead of schedule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert walked up to a large floor-to-ceiling mirror in the room, looking at his reflection... For him, his only weapon was his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also a face that could easily win a woman's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for someone like Harley, who had seen so many attractive people from a young age, his face was nothing special to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he, he didn't even know what to do to win her affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should he continue to let his greed spread unchecked, or should it be stopped immediately?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, Calvert's ad shoot was finished, and rumors started circulating in the circle that the big princess of the Hart family was the power behind Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the way people around Calvert looked at him changed. Even some well-known figures in the circle started to strike up conversations with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well aware that it wasn't really because of his own abilities, but more likely due to his connection with Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, he didn't want to let any opportunity slip by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by ceaselessly seizing opportunities and constantly climbing upwards, could he get closer to Harley and perhaps, have more chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she never fell in love with him in the end, he still wanted to give it a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of doing nothing and letting his heart die like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, in the Hart family's living room, Brian looked at his daughter and said, "Recently, I heard an interesting rumor. It's about you and that model named Calvert. Apparently, you two have an unusual relationship. You even went to his photoshoot, and when he got hurt, you were really worried?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback, thinking, "This is way too exaggerated..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you, he and I are just friends," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you really have been to his shooting location and saw him get injured, and you were quite anxious?" Brian's focus was clearly on this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley blinked, "I wouldn't say I was particularly nervous. At most, seeing him hurt just made me feel a bit uneasy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you just see him as a friend?" Brian retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, what? Do you think I actually like him?" Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you didn't care for him, why would you get so worked up about his injury in front of others? You should know what that implies to people," Brian said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley pursed her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, she knew, but at that moment, she didn't think about all that. She just wanted to quickly assess his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that kid, he might actually benefit from these rumors. The question is, can he keep his sense of self amidst these benefits? After all, many people get lost in this circle. If he truly loses himself, won't you regret it?" Brian asked his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley thought for a moment, "I don't know, after all, that hasn't happened yet. But I don't mind if he uses that rumor to gain some benefits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really like that kid, I can arrange for someone to groom him properly."</span></p></div>
