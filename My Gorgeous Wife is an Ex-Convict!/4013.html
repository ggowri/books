        <h1>Chapter 4011</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William hugged Jasper tightly. "Don't blame yourself anymore. You are also a victim. If you want to blame someone, blame Irene!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm so scared!" Jasper buried her face deeply in William's arms and choked, "I'm afraid we won't find Nancy. I'm afraid my big brother will collapse. He... loves Nancy. He told me himself that he loves Nancy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's heart skipped a beat. Although he had guessed the possibility when he saw Mick almost sleepless in order to find Nancy, hearing Jasper say it out loud still shocked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, he didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, will my big brother be like my grandfather? I'm so scared, really scared that my big brother will make the same choice as my grandfather." Jasper trembled as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was really scared, and the fear was so strong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, he won't. Your big brother has you and your siblings, parents who love him. He's not like your grandfather back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William also knew something about Jasper's grandfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, no matter what, promise me that we'll face it together!" William hugged Jasper tightly and comforted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper just continued to bury herself in William's arms, crying in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't even know how to face her big brother's pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of this pain, she caused it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt like she had just had a long and painful dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the dream, it felt like all of her bones were being crushed, and she was constantly in pain, making her almost collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But every time she felt like she couldn't hold on any longer, it was as if there was a voice constantly calling her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy! Nancy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who could it be? It sounded like Mick's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick and Jasper had a good relationship. She dragged Irene down with her into the sea, so Jasper was saved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Would Mick be happy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper could live well, so Mick must be very happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps he would forgive her for some of the mistakes she had made in the past!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he could really forgive her, it would be great. Even if she died, she would die with a clear conscience!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It felt like sunshine was pouring into the darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy opened her heavy eyelids and gradually saw the scene in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A white ceiling, a white hospital bed, and medical staff in white coats. Was she...in the hospital?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wake up, the patient in bed 32 has woken up." The shocking voice rang in her ear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And several hours later, Nancy finally figured out what the situation was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is a small town clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The town is far from Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It is said that she drifted to a fishing village holding onto a piece of driftwood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, many people thought she was dead, but an old childless woman in the fishing village saw her finger move, so she dragged her back home and tried to save her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later, although she was alive, she was like a vegetable, without waking up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When a college student returned to the village and learned about her situation, he quickly sent her to the county clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Nancy had no identification documents, the clinic only provided the simplest life-sustaining measures for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even these basic care and intravenous fluids cost all the savings of the childless old woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And more importantly, her belly was getting bigger day by day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was... pregnant!</p></div>
