        <h1>Chapter 4377 Worried About Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?" Harley stepped forward, lifting Calvert's chin with her hand, and asked with a furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her action took everyone by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, as people looked at the two, there was something more in their gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stared blankly at the person in front of him, his breath involuntarily hitching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During his time as a model, due to the demands of the job, he had needed to engage in intimate gestures with shooting partners. Although he had felt uncomfortable at times, he had gradually grown accustomed to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, such physical contact was common during shoots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, as she held his chin like this, Calvert's heartbeat suddenly accelerated. Even though he kept telling himself to calm down, she was just checking the injuries on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, a blush crept onto his face, and he couldn't bring himself to meet her eyes, afraid she might discern the emotions he was trying to conceal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing, just got hit by those troublemakers during the conflict," Calvert said softly, "It's no big deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, it really wasn't a big deal. After all, he was used to being beaten up. Not only by his alcoholic father but also by those who didn't like him at school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when Calvert said this, he used a declarative tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next moment, Harley's voice rose again, "How can you say this isn't a big deal? You're a model, you still have shoots to do. Do you know what it means to have an injury on your face? It could potentially delay the entire shooting schedule!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry..." He suddenly felt remorseful. How could he not have thought of it? He was a model now, she had given him this opportunity, and he had worked so hard to get to this point, only to get hurt so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she very disappointed in him?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you're not the one who should be apologizing!" Harley said, "And besides, think about the people who care about you. How do you think they feel seeing you hurt like this? </span><span>So</span><span> no matter what, don't treat your injuries lightly. You need to do your best to take care of yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was taken aback. Who could possibly be worried about him? His fans? Or the people he works </span><span>with?But</span><span> his fans were merely infatuated with the image he portrayed in front of the camera, and the people he worked with were only involved because of their vested interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was there anyone else besides this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not for any other reason, just simply worried about him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is today's shoot over?" Harley asked the crew member next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes... That's it for today," the director replied. Given the current situation, there was no way to continue filming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll take Calvert to the hospital to get the wound on his cheek treated," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I just got slapped, there's no need for a hospital." Calvert quickly said. In this kind of injury, after a few days, the mark will naturally fade away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you're just getting a bruise ointment, let the doctor check you out first before getting it. If you don't want me to worry more, then listen to me!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body stiffened: "You're worried about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I come here if I wasn't worried about you!" She felt at a loss for words, "Aren't we friends?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's eyelashes fluttered. Yes, they were friends, but why did he still feel a sense of </span><span>dissatisfaction?</span></p></div>
