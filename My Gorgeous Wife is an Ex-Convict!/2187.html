        <h1>Chapter 2185</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even if it's old and a girl's toy, it's mine. Nobody can take it!" William now looked like an angry lion cub. "Where did you put the doll?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This doll was the only thing he brought from Reed Residence. It was given to him by Jasper! It was his most precious treasure!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The maid was startled, and she began to stammer. "It's... It's in the storeroom." The things the family wanted to get rid of were usually stored in the storeroom. Once they collected enough items, they would sell them to junk collectors. It was considered extra money for the servants in the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William immediately rushed downstairs and headed for the storeroom, and the maid followed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper blinked as she hid in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She... had indeed seen William just now, but William was different from what she remembered. There seemed to be something in him that she could not describe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The maid had respectfully called William &lsquo;Little Young Master&rsquo;, and William seemed to be living a good life here. Suddenly, Jasper felt that it would be difficult to ask him to go back with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she immediately tossed the problem aside. She needed to quickly find William and apologize!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper recalled the location of the storeroom on the map and sneaked toward it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, there was a sudden shout. "Where did you come from? Why are you here so late at night? Who are your parents?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper turned around and saw a middle-aged woman who was dressed like a housekeeper. She was walking toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The housekeeper thought Jasper was one of the servants&rsquo; children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I..." Jasper Reed's small hand reached for her small backpack. Then, she grabbed a handful of money and threw it at the housekeeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her eldest brother said most people would subconsciously pick up money when they saw it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The female housekeeper never expected the child before her to toss a handful of bills, and they were all hundred-dollar bills too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was momentarily stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While running, Jasper took out a communicator and said to Mick Reed, "Brother, they found me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Found you? Did you toss the money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes. I ran away, but she's chasing after me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then sprinkle some mung beans. I'll cut off the electricity again for you. Remember to put on night-vision goggles!" said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay!" Jasper responded hurriedly. Seeing the housekeeper getting close, she quickly raised her hand again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The housekeeper thought that she was going to toss money again, so she did not stop. Unexpectedly, she threw out mung beans this time. The housekeeper almost fell to the floor when she stepped on them. She tried to get up but was surrounded by mung beans. Therefore, she kept falling as she tried to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hurry! Hurry and catch the kid!" the housekeeper called out to the servants nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The servants nearby gathered around them. Jasper quickly scattered as much money and mung beans as she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, one could only hear repeated thumping sounds as people kept slipping to the floor. Some people fell and were reluctant to give up the money, so they started picking up the bills.</p></div>
