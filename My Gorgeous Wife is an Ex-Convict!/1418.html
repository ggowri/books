        <h1>Chapter 1417</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I wished for a friend I helped to live a healthy life and not be troubled by diseases. Now that I got a good sign, he should be alright now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Friend? What friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"A friend I&rsquo;ve never met, but perhaps I will someday. I'll introduce you to each other when that happens!" she said with a sweet smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What kind of friend have you never met? An online friend?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's a secret! I'll tell you in the future!" she said while beaming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was only when he thought back to it now that he realized he was the friend she had spoken about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She saved him. Although they had never met, she was still concerned about his health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he ruined her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had asked her more details about her friend, he might have gotten a clue but he missed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had never thought of hearing her tell him about this &lsquo;secret&rsquo; again because he knew back then that she and he would never have a future together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was only dating her for revenge then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the bodyguard beside Martin Weiss came forward and said, "Mr. Weiss, are you okay..." His voice stopped short.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because Martin Weiss's eyes were now red and filled with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if his whole being was enveloped in never-ending pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace came to see Kyla Corbyn, she only saw Martin Weiss standing still in front of the ward, looking just like a zombie standing on his feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace slightly sighed to herself. 'If he had known it would come to this, would he have let things go this far?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But he... Judging from Martin Weiss's haggard appearance, Jay might&rsquo;ve been right when he said Martin Weiss loves Kyla. Otherwise, he wouldn't be behaving like this even if he feels guilty.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How long has he been standing here?" Grace asked Jason's two men who were guarding outside the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ever since last night," they replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace glanced at Martin Weiss again before walking into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn was the only person left in the ward. She was looking down at her hospital gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked down and saw a faint tinge of dull red on the hem. It was... the color of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you hurt? Where are you bleeding?" Grace was taken aback and quickly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn seemed to come to her senses and said as she shook her head, "I didn't get hurt. I&rsquo;m not bleeding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then this blood..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It&rsquo;s Martin Weiss&rsquo;s. He came to me last night and grabbed me by the hem." It was only just now that she noticed that the hem was stained with blood.</p></div>
