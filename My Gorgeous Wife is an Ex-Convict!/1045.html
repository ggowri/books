        <h1>Chapter 1044</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not expect Grace to come to him. After all, she always seemed to keep her distance from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was somewhat surprised when he knew why she came to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to go to the charity gala tonight?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. Can I?" Grace asked eagerly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Why not? But you have to let me know why you want to attend the gala so suddenly. You're not after some celebrity, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, several top celebrities were attending the charity gala, so the event was attracting a lot of fans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if she was really after some celebrity, he could give her a hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People in the entertainment industry would show him some respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to meet Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels. I heard they'll be attending the charity gala tonight," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Meet them?" Doubt flashed across Brian's eyes. "They're attending the charity gala, but you and them..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a little personal. It has to do with a friend of mine." Grace stopped short.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'll set it up. Although time is a little tight, we'll make it!" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Time is a little tight? What does that mean?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half an hour later, she finally understood what Brian meant when he said time was tight. Brian had someone drive a minivan over, and one of Emerald City's top stylist, Sam, styled her in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll attract a lot of attention if you don't dress up and show up at the charity gala in what you&rsquo;re wearing now," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that everyone would dress up formally for galas like this. Her casual clothes were out of place. She went to Brian at a last minute&rsquo;s notice, so now she had to get her makeup done in the car as they headed toward the gala&rsquo;s venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're such a hassle, dragging me here to do someone's makeup! Is this your new girlfriend?" Sam joked. He seemed to know Brian well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," Brian said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The answer was just as Sam expected. After all, it was not easy to be the crown prince's new girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she looked pretty good, she was not exactly stunning. He had also noticed her hands that bore many calluses. The skin on her hands was a bit rougher than other women, and the joints of her fingers were slightly deformed. One could tell she did a lot of rough work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was also surprised. He wondered what the crown prince had to do with the woman in front of him. After all, a woman with such hands seemed to have nothing to do with the crown prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next thing Brian said made Sam's hand, which was filling in Grace's eyebrow, tremble. It almost ruined her makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "She's the one I love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sam immediately widened his eyes. He looked at Brian before looking at the woman in front of him. 'Is this... the one the crown prince loves?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sam remembered how the crown prince confessed in an interview that he had someone he loved, but the woman had not accepted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Therefore... she hasn't accepted the crown prince?'</p></div>
