        <h1>Chapter 2479</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace rushed to the washroom and leaned over the sink to throw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Blaargh... Blaargh..." The sound of vomiting was so clear in the washroom that she almost seemed to be throwing up everything in her stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unbeknownst to her, a man outside the bathroom was worried about her while she was throwing up like crazy in there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's indifferent face was now full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crown prince of the entertainment industry had never been worried about any woman, except her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every move she made affected him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kept telling himself that she was now living a good life with Jason, and that was enough for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person she loved was Jason. Her affection for him was nothing more than something that stemmed from childhood memories. He knew this, but his instincts surpassed his reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment he saw her uncomfortably rushing into the washroom, he could not help following her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of vomiting inside made him restless. He was afraid that something was wrong with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace finally emerged from the washroom, Brian quickly went forward and asked, "What came over you? Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Brian with a flicker of shock in her eyes before shaking her head. "I probably thought of something bad in the past when I heard Amber Mitchell talking about the conspiracy. It must have caused some discomfort in me. I feel better now after throwing up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes darkened. 'It must be the car accident she was involved in&hellip; She didn't die in the crash, but she spent three years in prison for it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He found out later that she had suffered during her time in prison. What was he doing at that time? He was dating women who looked like her and living a life everyone envied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry I didn't find you sooner," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "It's not your fault. Besides, the people responsible have already gotten the punishment they deserve."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not feel good when she said so. He only felt sorrier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was sorry he missed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where's Jason? Why didn't he come with you today?" he asked as he changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He went back to Emerald City with the kids yesterday," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was surprised at that. "He left you alone in Deer City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to worry about?" Grace replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes flickered. He knew she understood what he meant. He did not expect Jason to leave Deer City first and leave Grace alone when he was still here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were in the past, Jason would never have done this, but now... Was Jason not afraid that he would take the opportunity to approach Grace and steal her heart?</p></div>
