        <h1>Chapter 2384</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you had enough? She's mentally ill, and no one is allowed to visit her except her family. I'll call the police if you insist on staying!" Louise Mitchell warned fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if she's a patient, you have no right to treat her like this. You&rsquo;re treating her like an animal. She's your sister!" Kyla glared at her while clenching her teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell smiled. "It&rsquo;s exactly because she's my sister that I hope she can get back to normal. It&rsquo;s stimulation therapy. You can ask her doctor if you don't believe me! If you don't fuck off, I'll call the police!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she made a gesture to pull out her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace grabbed Kyla by the arm and said, "Kyla, let's leave first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't forget what you promised me when you came here!" Martin Weiss said as his face suddenly approached Kyla. He said in a voice audible only to each other, "It won't help if you stay here any longer. If you want to help your friend, do as I say now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla trembled, and Martin Weiss held her hand to bring her out of the ward. The ward door was closed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's face was full of doubts. 'Who are the three people just now? Anyone who Director Wang allows in can't be an ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does Amber Mitchell even have such friends?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But so what if your friends have come for you?" Louise Mitchell suddenly smiled, walked up to Amber Mitchell, and stepped on her right hand, which was missing a finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell instantly let out a muffled groan of pain but nothing else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell looked at her reaction with satisfaction and smiled even more complacently. "You're a mental patient, and you&rsquo;ll stay here for the rest of your life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell only hung her head low as if she could not hear anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla and the rest left the hospital. They got into the car outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they got in the car, Kyla took a deep breath and said, "I... I want to save Amber Mitchell. Her sister is abusing her. Grace, Martin, please help me save Amber Mitchell, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurriedly reassured Kyla by saying, "Since I accompanied you here, I'll help you. But don't let yourself get too emotional and risk a miscarriage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, you've seen Amber Mitchell and Louise Mitchell today. Now, we'll figure out how to meet Amber Mitchell alone," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me arrange it," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was delighted to hear that but then added, "Then... when can I see Amber Mitchell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll do it as soon as possible, but Deer City isn't the Weiss family's territory, after all. Some things may take a while," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the three arrived at their hotel, Grace said to Kyla, "I have to go out for something later. You guys should rest early."</p></div>
