        <h1>Chapter 4103</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina continued, "Of course, if I misunderstood, I'm really sorry. But Mr. Patel, you know Chandler and have connections with Hunter. However, from your tone just now, it seems like you want me to feel used and have a big fight with Chandler, or even break up with him, isn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler seemed surprised that Tina could be so direct, although that was indeed his intention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Weldon had experienced many storms and quickly regained his composure after Tina's words made him feel a bit awkward. "What if I really want you to break up with Chandler?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina blinked. "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Of course, it's because I despise the way the Hunter family uses people," Weldon said. "They only think about themselves and don't care about others' wishes. They even force people who don't love them to have their children just to keep themselves alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was taken aback. Another child?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Is having children so important?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A bitter smile appeared on Weldon's lips. "It seems that Chandler hasn't told you everything," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you want to know?" Weldon asked. "I can tell you if you agree to a condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No need!" Tina refused. "If I really want to know, I'll ask Chandler myself. So, I won't agree to any conditions. Since there's nothing else, I'll leave now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After speaking, Tina was about to leave when Weldon's voice suddenly sounded behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "The placenta of the child born to the person selected by Hunter to cure the curse has the effect of eliminating the curse. So, as long as the placenta is made into medicine and taken, the curse in the body can be resolved! It's precisely because of this that the people of Hunter will do everything possible to make the selected person have a child!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina's footsteps suddenly stopped, and she turned to look at Weldon, seeming to not believe what he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Weldon sneered lightly. "If you don't believe it, you can ask Chandler yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina tightly pursed her lips and after a while, said, "I didn't agree to any conditions, why did you tell me all this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I was impulsive and blurted it out!" Weldon laughed at himself. "If you ever see a ring with red and blue gemstones in the Hunter family, I hope you can give it to me. Of course, I will offer you a satisfactory price. The ring itself is not valuable, as the gemstones used are ordinary and the ring was made by an unknown craftsman. But... it has some sentimental value to my family. If I can get it, I will be very grateful to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Pausing for a moment, Weldon continued,</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Of course, if you're not willing to help, then let's just forget I ever made this request today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After breaking up with Weldon, Tina's mind was still in a bit of a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Giving birth... was actually for the placenta, which could be used as medicine to completely get rid of the parasites in Chandler's body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's why Mr. Hunter mentioned the idea of having a child! He said that only by having a child could Chandler survive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Weldon said, she was the one being used.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why didn't she feel angry after hearing what Weldon said?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All she felt was a kind of heartache that she couldn't even explain to herself.</p></div>
