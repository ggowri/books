        <h1>Chapter 1167</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two quickly unbuckled their seatbelts as they spoke. The car was now traveling at 70 miles per hour and moving steadily toward a remote area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They could have taken the opportunity to jump out of the car, but suddenly, there was a sand truck coming diagonally. The driver of the sand truck also saw Lina's car and began to slow down, but he did not stop. After all, according to the traffic rules, Lina should be the one to stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina could not stop her car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they hit the sand truck and the sand came falling, they would not be able to escape the sand even if they managed to remove themselves from the scene of impact!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was now desperately turning the steering wheel, trying to pull the car away from the sand truck, but the truck was loaded with sand and the driver was not stopping at all. Even if he now noticed that there was something wrong with Lina's car, it was already too late to hit the brakes now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that the two vehicles were about to collide, Lina cried out almost in despair, "Grace, jump! Quick!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another car suddenly rushed toward them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, there was only a loud crash and the sound of brakes screeching. The front of the other car had hit the front of Lina's car, forcing Lina's car to stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In just a few seconds, everything seemed to have turned upside down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sand truck had finally stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Lina were still in the car. They were slumped against their seats and groaned because of the impact, but they both knew they had survived!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had really... survived!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, are you... okay?" Grace struggled to speak, and her bones ached. Her whole body felt as if it were falling apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... it was so much better than what they had expected!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... okay..." Lina's voice rang with a tremble. It sounded as if she had replied with much difficulty, but hearing her, Grace was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What the hell happened just now? They were just about to collide with the sand truck, but what was with the car that came rushing suddenly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not for the car, she and Lina would be dead by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That moment flashed across Grace's mind like lightning. It was a silver-gray car that had rushed toward them. It... almost looked like it was trying to save their lives!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was a bad angle or if the sand truck had not stopped, the car might have crashed into the sand truck along with theirs!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Grace shuddered. 'Brian's car... seems to be the same color and model!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it... be Brian's car?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it Brian? Is that possible?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sat up with difficulty. She endured the pain in her body and looked through the broken glass window at the car that had crashed with theirs.</p></div>
