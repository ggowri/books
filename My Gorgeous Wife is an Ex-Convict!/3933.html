        <h1>Chapter 3931</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be that the car had been parked there since she got off it earlier?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was rare to see a car worth millions parked at such an ordinary market entrance, so people coming in and out of the market couldn't help but stare at it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does Mr. Reed need something?" Nancy asked the driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not sure, young master only asked me to pick you up," the driver replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy pursed her lips and followed the driver to the car. He opened the door, but Nancy didn't immediately get in. Instead, she bent down and asked Mick inside the car, "Mr. Reed, is there anything else you need?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get in the car, I'll take you home," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I can take the bus home, it's very convenient," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get in the car, don't make me say it a third time," Mick said, a little annoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy hesitated for a moment before getting on the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver put the two big bags of vegetables in Nancy's hands into the trunk of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Address," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy gave him the address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car headed towards her rented room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you buy so many vegetables? Are you living with someone else?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced at the bags she was carrying earlier and thought that the amount was enough for one person to eat for a week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I live alone. But today is my mother's 57th birthday, and I plan to cook more dishes tonight to pay my respects," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick calculated the days in his mind and realized that it had been a month since he saw her in the rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're paying your respects alone?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, alone," she said, looking down with a hint of sadness on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her thin and fragile body. When he saw her being slapped before, he felt that she was so thin that she could be easily knocked down by a slap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sadness on her face made him suddenly feel a sense of discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was like something was stuck in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My condolences," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can do it. I will live well," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother was pushed down the stairs by Clarissa to help her. She wanted to live and carry on her mother's legacy, and then... find a way to bring justice for her mother and not let Clarissa get away with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though it will be difficult and take many years, she will still persist in doing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car arrived at her neighborhood, and Nancy got out of the car, but she didn't expect Mick to get out of the car with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at him strangely, "Why are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since we're already here, I'll pay my respects to your mother too," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was shocked and puzzled, "Why do you... want to pay respects to my mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother and he were not related, at most they had met at some banquets before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick couldn't say why, maybe it was because when she mentioned paying respects alone, the sadness on her face made him uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The dead are great, and paying respects to the living. Do we need a reason?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, thank you," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, there was one more person paying respects to her mother, not just her alone, which made her feel less lonely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver opened the trunk of the car, and Nancy was about to take out the two large bags of vegetables, but Mick stepped forward and picked up the two bags of vegetables, "Let me do it."</p></div>
