        <h1>Chapter 504</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a vague conjecture in her mind, but it was so crazy that she could not believe it herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her phone rang. Grace looked at the caller ID. It was Kyla's number, so she answered the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson will be discharged tomorrow, Grace. Can you come to work the day after tomorrow? I'd like to tidy up the restaurant and reopen it the next day," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, no problem," replied Grace. Speaking of which, it had been a rare break for her after she got out of prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great. By the way, Nelson wants to talk to you too. Why don't you say something to Nelson?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was slightly stunned for a moment, then she said into the phone, "Nelson? I'm Aunt Grace, can you hear me? I'll see you the day after tomorrow, Nelson. When you can understand and speak, how about I tell you lots of stories?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she knew that he might not understand what she was saying, she still hoped so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, a young but hoarse voice came from the other end of the phone, "Aunt&hellip; Grace..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could hardly believe her ears. What did she just hear? Was that Nelson calling her? Even if Nelson could make a sound before this, they were all just meaningless &lsquo;ah&rsquo; sounds. Now, he was actually making meaningful sounds, like calling out her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace," Kyla's voice came over the phone again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was it really... Nelson talking, Kyla? Can he talk now?" Grace asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but only a few words. He still needs more time and practice," answered Kyla, but her voice was clearly happy and proud. "The doctor said Nelson should be able to speak soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, how could she not be proud? Her son had made rapid progress since getting the cochlear implant. Even the doctor said that he had a good IQ and was obviously talented in picking up languages. Had it not been for his inability to hear, his language skills now would far exceed those of other children his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's great." Grace was also happy for Kyla and Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call was over, Grace thought about buying Nelson a gift when she returned to the restaurant to celebrate Nelson's ability to hear now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason got home in the evening, Grace asked about the news she had seen during the day. "What happened to that shopping mall? Do you have anything to do with the sudden demolition of the mall?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace asked directly, so Jason answered her directly as well, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes widened in surprise. Though she had only speculated about it, she was surprised when she got the real answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You should have already guessed something since you&rsquo;re asking me now. Why are you so surprised?" asked Jason as he raised his eyebrows strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was it you who asked the Atkinson family to demolish the shopping mall?" Grace asked breathlessly, taking a moment to swallow the sudden secretion of saliva in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he answered lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because..." There was a slight quiver in her voice before she continued, "Is it because the Atkinson family kicked me out of the mall the other day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he answered, but in a flat voice as if it was a perfectly normal thing to do.</p></div>
