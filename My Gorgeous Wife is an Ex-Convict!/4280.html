        <h1>Chapter 4278 Let Her Leave</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry..." Chandler croaked, using all his remaining restraint to let go of Tina. "You go... close the door and go far away, don't come near me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to speak, his mind and body silently fighting each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body desperately longed to be close to her, because being close, holding her, would alleviate the pain in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that instinctive impulse was not limited to just holding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at Chandler with teary eyes, thinking that he might have regained some normalcy. Instead, she saw him suddenly struggle to stand up and stumble towards the framed picture hanging on the wall. He forcefully smashed the frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned, but then she gasped in disbelief as Chandler reached out with his bare hands to grab the broken glass from the shattered frame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp glass immediately caused his hand to bleed profusely, staining his entire hand crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler... what are you doing?" Tina's voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina... you leave, I won't stay clear-headed for long..." he struggled to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he could only use this pain to fight against the instinct in his body, to make himself stay clear-headed for a little longer. "Go... close the door... pretend you didn't see anything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on with you? I'll call for emergency help..." Tina said, reaching for her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Chandler interrupted. "It's a curse from the witch... I'll be fine in a while... no need to go to the hospital... you... just don't stay here, I'll lose control and hurt you... go! Just go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, his voice had become almost voiceless and hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stood still, in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler felt the desire in his body intensify. Wherever she stood, it was like a silent temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood in his veins seemed to be shouting, wanting to possess her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Chandler rushed towards Tina and firmly grabbed her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina snapped back to reality, panic flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been absent-minded just now; she should have left as soon as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, being held by him like this, she couldn't leave...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tina was about to struggle, Chandler dragged her out of the room. Then, in the next moment, his voice intermittently rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave! I'll be fine, so... you absolutely must not open this door..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his voice fell, he released her wrist, the door slammed shut, and Tina was left outside alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the closed door, still faintly hearing Chandler's agonized screams from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And on her wrist, there were bloodstains, his blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had escaped a disaster, why did her heart feel heavy, with no sense of relief? There was only worry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would happen to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said it was a curse from the witch, a so-called curse that would cause him such agony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, curses and witchcraft became clear concepts in front of her!</span></p></div>
