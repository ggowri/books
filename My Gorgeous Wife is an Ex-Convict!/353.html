        <h1>Chapter 352</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was almost choked by his words. Cheating? What the hell! She had not cheated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the presence of Hadwin, she thought for a while and explained, "Well... My mother forced me to go on a blind date. She would disown me if I didn&rsquo;t. I tried to tell him that I have a boyfriend, but he interrupted me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not lying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your mother forced you to go on the blind date?" he asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes!" She smiled lamely. In short, her mother was extremely aggressive in forcing her to go on blind dates. She was the type who would be tortured to bits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn't tell your family that you have a boyfriend?" he asked with a dangerous gleam in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was suddenly guilty. Tell her mom and dad? How was she supposed to tell them? Hadwin's identity alone would probably frighten her mom and dad, especially when&hellip; she and Hadwin were inconclusive. They were just going through the motions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We started dating so suddenly, and it would probably scare my parents if I told them I have a boyfriend all of a sudden. I'm thinking of finding the right opportunity to talk to them later." Lina tried hard to defend herself even though she had no intention to tell them at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you tell them?" Hadwin narrowed his black eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I promise." She quickly put on an expression as if she would be struck by lightning if she lied. All that was left was to raise her hand and swear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. If you ever go on a blind date again, you're dead, Lina," he said as he nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Was that a threat? However, thinking of her situation now, she could only laugh dryly. "It will never happen again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but complain to herself. 'Even if I'm just a girlfriend who&rsquo;s going through the motions, I seem a little too cowardly.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Should a boyfriend not be caring and attentive to his girlfriend? Why did she get threats instead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he wanted to get even with her, should he not make her fall in love with him first? In those movies and dramas, the male lead would plot their revenge by pretending to be extremely gentle. They would treat the woman like a delicate treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not feel like she was being treated like a delicate treasure. She just felt like she could die at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed satisfied with her answer, so he turned and walked on while she hurried after him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she walked out of the park, her stomach gave an untimely loud &lsquo;purr&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you hungry?" asked Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A little," she answered, slightly embarrassed. She looked at his expression which looked calm. She then said, "Why don't we... eat here? There are a lot of gourmet restaurants around here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced sideways at her. Her eyes were shining right now. Her eyes were as bright as ever when it came to food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they were abroad, she had always asked him about the local specialties and insisted that he take her there to have a try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on," he said. Sure enough, a look of joy instantly came over her face.</p></div>
