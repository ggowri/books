        <h1>Chapter 3953</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Nancy realize that she had met Jasper before at Mason Reed's wedding, who </span><span>was the second child of the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she only glanced at him from afar, so she didn't recognize him at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello," Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, did you come here alone?" Jasper asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, no, I'm...with..." Nancy hesitated, not sure if she should tell Mick's family that she came to watch the game with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? You didn't come with my brother, did you?" Jasper guessed as he saw Nancy's hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And from Nancy's expression, Jasper knew he was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you really come to watch the game with my brother? Is he still outside?" Jasper asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..." Nancy looked embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Nancy was sitting in a private room at a famous restaurant in Emerald City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the room, besides her, there were Mick, Jasper, and Jasper's boyfriend William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stared at Nancy with wide eyes, not hiding his curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy felt a little embarrassed by the attention, but Mick came to her rescue. "Alright, stop staring at her like that. If you have any questions, just ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Big brother, are you and Nancy dating?" Jasper asked surprisingly, calling Nancy by her first name as if they were old friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy almost choked on her own saliva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick, on the other hand, responded casually, "Do we look like we're dating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, why not!" Jasper said, "Big brother, you've never come to watch a game with another woman before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does watching a game together mean we're dating?" Mick asked in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper hesitated for a moment, then persisted, "But is it or isn't it?" You see, their parents were worried that Mick didn't have any feelings for the opposite sex, and even thought he was asexual, unable to develop feelings for anyone outside of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their parents didn't even mind if Mick fell in love with someone of the same sex, but whether it was the same sex or the opposite sex, Mick never showed any special interest in anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Nancy was the first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Mr. Reed and I are not dating," Nancy quickly said, afraid that the other party would continue to misunderstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Jasper seemed skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, really," Nancy smiled slightly. At least this was the truth, she and Mick had not really started dating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mick had said that if he ever really liked her, he would date her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...maybe that day would never come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, all she had to do was maintain Mick's interest in her to achieve her goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, Nancy, let's be friends and exchange contact information. We can chat when we're free," Jasper said positively, although he was a little disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Nancy agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two exchanged contact information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the meal, William was polite and courteous, with a faint smile on his face, which made Nancy feel that Jasper's boyfriend was a good match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Jasper, the atmosphere during the meal was quite pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the meal, William's care for Jasper was evident. He helped him with the food and even peeled the shrimp for him. The love in his eyes was so obvious that even Nancy, an outsider, could see it clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a relationship is really enviable!</span></p></div>
