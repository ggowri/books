        <h1>Chapter 1516</h1>
        <div><p>“But I like Jaylee Cummins more. Mommy, can’t we go with Jaylee Cummins?” the kid begged, her face scrunching up.</p><p>“Your elder brother’s name is Mick Reed, and so you’ll be Jasper Reed. Isn’t this nice? Other people will know that you’re siblings after hearing your names. Haven’t you always wanted an elder brother?” Grace asked.</p><p>“Can’t we have my elder brother rename himself as Mick Cummins instead?” the girl asked, tilting her head.</p><p>“Maybe you can ask him when you meet him,” Grace said.</p><p>“Okay!” Jaylee raised her chin, looking determined. </p><p>Lina laughed at her goddaughter’s antics. “Do you like the name Jaylee Cummins that much?”</p><p>“Yes, I do!” The kid nodded.</p><p>“Why? Because you’re used to it? Or do you not want to change your name?” Lina guessed.</p><p>Before the kid could reply, Grace said, “She thinks that ‘Jasper Reed’ is much more difficult to write compared to ‘Jaylee Cummins’. She’d agree to change her name to ‘Jay Reed’ immediately if we offered the option to her!”</p><p>“...” Lina wanted to laugh. Her goddaughter was reluctant to change her name simply because it was more difficult to write?</p><p>The characters that made up ‘Jasper Reed’ were truly quite difficult to write for a child, though.</p><p>Their food arrived. The girl went to the playground area inside the restaurant as soon as she was done with her food. This was a children’s restaurant, so quite a lot of playing areas had been set up for children.</p><p>Jasper was near their table where the adults could see her, so Grace and Lina continued eating, though their gazes would often wander to where she was.</p><p>“Are you taking Jasper to meet Jason later?” Lina asked.</p><p>“Yes. I’m going to Reed Residence,” Grace said. She had called Jason a few times after she regained her memories. For the first number she called, the phone was turned off, and the second number was completely useless. Maybe strangers could never reach Jason through phone calls, Grace guessed. </p><p>This was why she decided to take her daughter to Reed Residence directly.</p><p>“But Jason… He’s different from before. After the Reed family told him that you died, I saw him twice and I got the feeling that he’s a little different from before. He’s unusually cold. I thought that it’s because of your death.”</p><p>Lina laughed self-deprecatingly. “And then I never saw him again. Mick Reed as well. I learned of the kindergarten he attends after much trouble and I saw him a few times from afar. There are men from the Reed family in charge of escorting him to and from school, so I can’t really approach him.”</p><p>What she did not tell Grace was that she had approached Mick Reed once, but when she tried to say something to him, she was blocked by the Reed family’s bodyguards as though they were worried that she would say something she should not. </p><p>Hearing that, Grace knew that her friend was worried that she would be put in an embarrassing situation when she visited Reed Residence. She said, “Sorry.”</p><p>“What are you talking about? What are you sorry for? It’s so great that you’re back now, but… Between the two children with Jason now, only Mick Reed is yours. There’s another girl named Oriel Lynch, she’s an adopted daughter. Her mother’s name is Irene Lynch. Rumor says that she’s close with Jason. You’ll have to stand up against that woman.”</p><p>Lina had to tell her friend everything she could. She knew that the rumors were just rumors, but they were so vividly spoken about that she could not help but worry.</p><p></p></div>
