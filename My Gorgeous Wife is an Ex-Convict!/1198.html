        <h1>Chapter 1197</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you remember what you last said to me when we parted in the hospital as children?" he asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Stella blinked and said, "Of course, I do. Didn't I give you one of my bracelets? I also told you we'd use them as tokens. I told you to take the bracelet with you when you come to see me. In case you come to me too late, each of us still has an identical bracelet. Even if our appearances have changed, we&rsquo;d still be able to recognize each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella deliberately added, "It was because I remembered watching a TV series where the male and female leads recognized each other by having half a jade pendant each, so I followed suit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Brian could not help but smile wryly. 'What am I thinking? Am I hoping what Grace said is true? Am I hoping that woman to be the little girl who saved me when I was a child? Am I hoping that the one I&rsquo;ve been missing all these years is Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But that person is Stella! Even if Stella isn't who I thought she was, and she&rsquo;s vain and constantly trying to get the best out of me, she was the one who saved me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella could also describe the things that happened when they were little. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's you," muttered Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, it's me... Brian... Do you believe what Grace said? She only said that to save Chase Harper! Because she knows that if you believe her, then you'll agree to whatever she asks. And if you want me to give up on going after Chase Harper, I'll... say yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella showed an affectionate expression as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pressing his thin lips together tightly, Brian stared at Stella as if in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's heart was pounding. However, she showed grievance on her face and bit her lower lip as she stammered, "Brian, you don't... believe me? Besides, it was you who came to me in the first place. Before that, I had no idea that the little boy I saved is the heir to the Hart family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian sighed. Yes, he was the one who found Stella based on all the clues, and the photos of Stella as a child looked exactly like the little girl he had met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those photos with the traces of time were not fake!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore... Stella was really the little girl he was looking for, while Grace made up such a lie to save Chase Harper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stella, I hope you're not lying to me," said Brian as he gently parted his thin lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could I possibly lie to you?" said Stella as she tried to calm herself down, fighting back the surge of fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Brian and Grace became estranged or even fell out over Chase Harper's incident as she had planned, then the position of Young Madam Hart would definitely be hers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's head was in a mess after she left the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out it was hard to find someone who would believe you unconditionally in this world! She had easily let her cousin take her place and even lied to Brian. Now, she was suffering the consequences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Chase Harper should not be the one to bear the consequences no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she knew what Stella was up to! Chase Harper's incident was only a trigger.</p></div>
