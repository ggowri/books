        <h1>Chapter 1863</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But if you do this, have you ever wondered what if Hadwin Stephenson insists on wanting the baby back if he learns about their existence one day?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina immediately said, "The baby's mine. I won't give them to anyone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "But he can sue and get the baby's custody. Didn't Martin Weiss also sue to take Nelson's custody from Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina instantly turned pale, and she also stopped eating her dessert. "Could he... get custody?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If he really wants to do that and hires the best lawyers, there&rsquo;s a 50-50 chance that he can get the baby's custody after they turn two," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina gritted her teeth as she clenched her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace sighed. "Lina, if you ever get to that point, I&rsquo;ll help you. But... how did you and Hadwin Stephenson get to this point? Didn&rsquo;t you say you were going to start over with Hadwin Stephenson that day?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said bitterly, "He and I can never start over. Maybe he never really loved me. I thought he broke up with Katherine Jackson because he never loved her. I thought he did it due to tMason Swansonrcumstances and he wanted to get justice for me, but it turns out that the breakup was just a sham."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you mean?" Grace asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I went to see Hadwin Stephenson that day but saw Katherine Jackson enter Hadwin Stephenson's mansion. She didn't come out until the next morning. The security guards at Hadwin Stephenson's mansion also said Katherine Jackson had come to the mansion several times after her public breakup with Hadwin Stephenson. She always spent the night and would only leave the mansion the next day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was painful for Lina to talk about this matter again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Could there be a misunderstanding?" Grace asked after pondering about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What kind of misunderstanding? Why would Hadwin Stephenson let Katherine Jackson spend the night at his mansion? I... can't take it even if he's doing it for his career. Maybe we do share different opinions. He has never really loved me. Perhaps I&rsquo;m just more of his type among the many women he has met, or..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She paused, and her voice was dry. "It's probably because of regret. He broke up with me for his career and didn't get me, so he wanted to get back together with me when the chance arose. But that&rsquo;s all there is to it. He can never give me what I want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace had a feeling that something was vaguely wrong when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes were full of indifference when he brought up Lina&rsquo;s name at the airport before, but logically speaking, there was no reason for Hadwin Stephenson to let Katherine Jackson spend the night in his mansion. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he had feelings for Katherine Jackson, he would not have gone through so much trouble to have a public breakup with her. If he wanted to break away from the Jackson family's control and even turn against them to get the Jackson family's assets, he had already achieved his goal. The Jackson family was already a sitting duck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Speaking of which, it seemed that two days after Lina went to look for Hadwin Stephenson, Stephenson Group announced the acquisition of part of the Jackson family's assets. However, the strange thing was that Hadwin Stephenson had offered them a good price. Judging from the Jackson family's current situation, you could say that they got a good price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Why did Hadwin Stephenson do that, then? Does Katherine Jackson have something on him? Or is there something else going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, what's on your mind?" Lina's voice made Grace come back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I was just thinking that maybe there's something wrong with Katherine Jackson," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said indifferently, "It doesn't matter. I just want to give birth to the baby and raise them. If Hadwin Stephenson really wants to fight with me for the baby, I won't give them up no matter what!"</p></div>
