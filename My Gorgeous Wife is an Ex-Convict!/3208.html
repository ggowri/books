        <h1>Chapter 3206</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Philip suddenly said, "I heard that your uncle Reed is going to help Jasper find a boy who can play the piano well, is that true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's small body suddenly stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want Jasper to find that boy?" Philip asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William tightly pursed his lips and looked at his father, but didn't answer immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Philip said, "William, if you really want Jasper to find that boy, then I won't interfere. Uncle Reed won't take long to find him. But if you don't want that boy to be found, then I can intervene and end this matter here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was surprised and looked at his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Philip raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, William asked, "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why am I willing to do this?" Philip raised his hand and touched his son's head. "Because you are my son, and as a father, I naturally want my son to be happy. So if you don't want it, I can make sure that boy won't be found by the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William blinked and Philip continued, "When I brought you back to the Barlow family, I told you that if you just followed Jasper, you might never get what you want. The more precious something is, the more it requires matching strength!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a pause, he smiled faintly, "Just like now, I have the ability to make sure that the person you don't want to see won't appear in front of Jasper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's beautiful black eyes seemed to understand something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, he shook his head and said, "No need. If Jasper really wants to find that person, then let her find them on her own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't want to see disappointment in Jasper's eyes. He hoped she could be happy, even though he would be scared, worried, nervous... and afraid that if she really fell in love with the person's piano and also considered that person important, what should he do...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when she thinks about the anticipation in her eyes today, she doesn't want to do something she doesn't like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really sure about this?" Philip asked seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, I've made up my mind," William nodded earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you have made up your mind, you will have to bear the consequences of your decisions in the future, no matter what happens. Do you understand? Don't regret the decision you made today!" Philip sighed and said, "You should know that every decision you make now may affect your future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's hand, which was hanging by his side, slowly tightened into a small fist. "I understand, and I won't regret it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he wanted to see Jasper's smile, this was more important than anything else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Philip said, "Okay, then let the Reed family find that boy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the son has made this decision, the father will no longer intervene. He only hopes that in the future, William will not regret the decision he made today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Philip's mind was filled with such thoughts.</p></div>
