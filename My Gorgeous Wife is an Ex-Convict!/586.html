        <h1>Chapter 585</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Through this glass wall, one could see the hubbub in the center of the hall outside. There were singing and dancing performances by various resident singers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared with the noise outside, the private room was strangely quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian poured himself a cup of tea, sipped on it, and stared coldly at the uproar outside that was alien to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door was pushed open, and the sound of footsteps rang in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned his head slightly and looked at the visitor. "You're here. Would you like a cup of tea?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks." Jason walked to a chair opposite Brian and sat down. "I came to tell you a few simple words. I'll leave right after."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his eyebrows slightly. "Really? What do you want to tell me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's your business to break up with Evelyn, but don't get Grace involved. I have limited patience and won't let Grace be targeted again and again." Jason warned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes glinted. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today, Evelyn's parents went to Grace and said you broke up with Evelyn because of Grace. Is the reason Evelyn's parents think so because of Evelyn or you?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian gently twirled the teacup in his hands. The fragrance of tea diffused through his nose along with the heat and gradually filled the whole room. "Does it matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since I'm here to see you, of course, it's important," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian lowered his eyelids and was silent. He did not immediately answer Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's voice once again rang in the private room. "Does your breakup with Evelyn have anything to do with Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's hands trembled almost unnoticeably. It was a subtle gesture, but Jason noticed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes darkened slowly, and an almost stagnant vibe pervaded the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, Brian slowly raised his phoenix eyes and met Jason's. "What if I say it does matter?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instantly, Jason's eyes looked like they were covered with ice. "Do you want to die?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She seems to mean a great deal to you. However, if I really want her, then you can't stop me even if you're Jason," Brian said, looking into his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Immediately, there was tension in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't afford her." There was an air of danger around Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian emptied his cup of tea. "She's not the one I'm looking for. Otherwise, there's no way I'll let go even if I have to fight you. Therefore, even if I've broken up with Evelyn, I'm not going to do anything about Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well then, I don't want Grace to get into any more trouble because of you." Jason finished talking, stood up, and walked straight out of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had the answer he wanted tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe he should be glad that Brian did not know that Grace was the person he was looking for. Even so, Brian was genuinely tempted by Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Brian had not been too obsessed with the person he was looking for, he would have...</p></div>
