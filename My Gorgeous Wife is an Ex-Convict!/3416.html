        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because some activities that I may enjoy, you may not necessarily enjoy, and some activities that you may enjoy, I may not necessarily enjoy. In this case, we can choose activities that we each like instead of forcing ourselves to participate in activities that one of us likes but the other doesn't," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if it's something you like, then I'll definitely like it too," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is that possible? You can't possibly like everything I like," she retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's possible," he said confidently. "If you like it, then I'll like it too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip and didn't say anything for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Are you upset?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath. "Mason, you should have your own likes and dislikes, instead of just liking what I like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I like you, and whatever you like, I'll like too," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She froze, looking at him with a dazed expression. In that moment, she felt that something had become deeply ingrained in his mind and couldn't be shaken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, by the way, what's this?" he suddenly noticed the ointment in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She instinctively tightened her grip on the ointment. "It's...something someone else gave me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Someone else gave this to you? Let me see," he said, taking the ointment from her hand and carefully examining the label. After a moment, he asked, "They gave this to you to apply on the injury on your shoulder?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who gave it to you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A kind senior." She said, "Okay, give me the ointment now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she planned to take the ointment back from his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had no intention of giving it to her, instead he walked over to the nearby trash can and threw the ointment away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason!" Veronica looked shocked. She never expected him to throw away the ointment like that. "What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This ointment is not necessary for you. If you feel that the effectiveness of the red flower oil at home is not sufficient, I can help you find other more useful ointments," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter if I need this ointment or not, it's still someone's kindness. You can't just throw it away like that!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want you to use things given by other seniors," he said, with a tone of clear displeasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you don't want me to use it, you can't throw it away," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're not going to use it, why keep it?" he asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glared at him. "Anyway, you can't do this kind of thing again in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't answer, clearly unwilling to agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them stared at each other until another classmate called out to Veronica, and she walked over to the classmate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Mason watched Veronica's back, his eyes gradually darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, Mason applied medicine to Veronica's shoulder every day, and each time, he would cover his eyes with a scarf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica could only let Mason apply the medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, it was time for the school's anniversary celebration. Each class would have a performance for the celebration, and Veronica's class was doing Alice's Tea House.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The classmates have decorated the classroom to look like a small tea room, with tablecloths on the tables and menus displayed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The menu consists of some snacks and desserts that students love to drink. In the class, students take turns being the waiters, carrying plates and serving guests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica is also a waitress, while Mason stands at the door as a sign.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Mason's appearance is already a living advertisement, and coupled with his background and family status, he has become a celebrity in the school. So when he stood at the entrance of the classroom, he attracted many people to come in.</p></div>
