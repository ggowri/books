        <h1>Chapter 132</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was what they had used to do before. In the past, when he warmed her hands, she would feel a warmth in her heart. However, now... she only had a kind of incomprehensible fear.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was because she didn't know what he was going to do.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She twisted her hand uneasily and wanted to pull away. However, his fingers held onto her tightly and did not allow her to move at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Call me Jay. Didn't you always call me Jay?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pursed her red lips tightly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just take it as my order, call me Jay," he muttered softly. He did not want to hear her call him "Mr. Reed", which sounded incomparably jarring to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace remained silent for a long time. Finally, she opened her mouth and softly said "Jay".</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A smile crept up the corner of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The pure smile made her a little absent-minded. In the past, she always felt that his smile was very clean, as if it had not been contaminated by the world, and she wanted to protect that pureness.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However... Jay...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Emerald City, perhaps no one would say that Jason was clean. It was said that his hands were covered in the blood and tears of countless people. It was also said that he was cold-blooded and ruthless. Once someone provoked him, there would not be a good ending.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, in this city, no one dared to provoke him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was ridiculous that in the past, she had thought of protecting such a person.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"When I first met you, I did just take it as a game. But later on, it was quite pleasant to get along with you." He had never explained himself before. However, now he was, and to her. If anyone else heard, they would be surprised. "How about you stay by my side in the future?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Stay by your side?" She looked at him in shock. She had never thought that he would make such a request.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you stay with me, I'll let you live the same life as before. No, I should say it'll be better than before. As long as it's not an excessive demand, I can promise you anything. You used to be a lawyer, right? I can help you regain your lawyer's license. It won't be a problem if you want to open a law firm either," he said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, she had thought that once she had gained more experience, she would set up her own law firm. However, it simply became an unrealistic daydream.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, Jason had actually said these words to her. It was as if someone was dangling some alluring fruit in front of her and tempting her to eat it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why?" she asked in confusion. "Didn't you say you wanted to get back at me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If I really wanted to take revenge on you, then I wouldn't have saved you the day before yesterday." Jason smiled faintly and said, "I already said that the feeling of getting along with you is pretty good. Hence, I will keep you by my side."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And then wait until you are tired of me?" she said. Was this still a game for him, a sister and brother game he had never played before? He was so gentle and kind to her now, just because there was still a sense of novelty.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tired of her?" Jason thought that he might not be tired of her for the rest of his life. However, at this moment, talking to Grace, he just calmly said the word "yes".</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He would never allow a woman to control him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sure enough!" Grace sighed in her heart. Once he got tired of the game, she would fall from the clouds into hell again.</p></div>
