        <h1>Chapter 2656</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated slightly before stepping into the elevator. Brian followed inside and helped Valda Theller press the button for the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stiffened, and her face paled when the elevator doors closed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can... Can I hold your hand?" Valda Theller said with difficulty. She wanted to hold something warm so she could stop recalling the scary scenes of what had happened today as well as back then. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the person in front of him. Her face was pale, while her round eyes looked misty. There was fear and longing in those dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is she longing for? Is she longing to hold my hand?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since he fell in love with Grace, he did not like other women touching him. He only touched Valda Theller to put on an act in front of Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not need to act right now. He could refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, the fear and longing in her eyes reminded him of his childhood when he almost fell off the cliff. His eyes were also full of fear and longing when he almost fell off the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was scared that he would fall and longed for someone to help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had reached out to grab him and saved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," he said slowly as he stretched his right hand to Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's trembling hand gripped Brian's hand as if it were driftwood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fear gradually faded when the warmth of his hand transferred to her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elevator soon stopped, and the doors opened. Valda Theller and Brian came to Valda Theller's apartment door. She took out the key and opened the door while holding his right hand tightly with her left hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren&rsquo;t you going in?&rdquo; he asked her as she had been standing at the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lower lip, and her left hand grabbed his right hand a little tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll stay with you for a while. You need to calm down," said Brian as he led Valda Theller into the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry. I know my mood's a little off right now. I just... Just..." she sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He added, "You must be afraid. I was careless to have put you through this. It won't happen again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not your fault. I'm grateful you came to my rescue," Valda Theller said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you call 110 earlier? They probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to make it there in time. Wouldn't it have been quicker if you had just called me?" he asked. She would probably have been badly hurt had he not gotten suspicious and rushed to the washroom after hearing that the way to it was blocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said awkwardly, "I... I figured if I called you, there would be only one of you while there were so many of them. I&rsquo;d be dragging you down. So I thought of calling 110. Uh... Of course, I didn't expect you to be so tough. They were no match for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gazed at her. "But did it ever occur to you that I put you through this? Even if I were to suffer with you, I would&rsquo;ve deserved it, no?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked. "But if we have to get beaten up, it&rsquo;s better for just one of us to get beaten up than two, no?&rdquo; </p></div>
