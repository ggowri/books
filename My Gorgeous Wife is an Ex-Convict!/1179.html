        <h1>Chapter 1178</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Elizabeth Jackson had done this herself, and the Jackson family had no idea about it. If it was done by the Jackson family, they would have been more stealthy and it would have been harder to catch them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After reading Elizabeth Jackson's statement, Lina said to Grace with a face of guilt, "Grace, I'm sorry. You almost died because of me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Don't say that if we're friends. If we're going to apologize, I'm afraid I have more to apologize about!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had given up her studies and a better future for her case. She had gone to a lot of trouble for her for three years. She could never repay her kindness!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stepped forward and said, "I didn't handle the matter well. I didn't expect Elizabeth Jackson to have the guts to do such a thing and made you two suffer!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had only been keeping an eye on the Jackson family but never sent anyone to see if there would be anything wrong with Elizabeth Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, in his opinion, Elizabeth Jackson was just the Jackson family's sacrifice. She could not stir up a storm no matter how she tried. Unexpectedly, that woman had done such a thing. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll make it up to you. I won't let Elizabeth Jackson escape justice. Since she dares to do such a thing, she should suffer the terrible consequences!" Hadwin Stephenson said with a cold voice. A hint of malice flashed across his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt her heart tremble. She had a feeling that Elizabeth Jackson was not going to have an easy life in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was Hadwin Stephenson's bottom line. A man like Hadwin Stephenson would never be soft-hearted when someone hurt Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Hadwin Stephenson had always been ruthless. Otherwise, he would never have become the Stephenson family's patriarch. One could imagine what would happen to Elizabeth Jackson and even the Jackson family in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three walked out of the police station after they were done. Lina, said "Grace, why don't we go have dinner together? It's almost dinner time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to speak when she caught a glimpse of a figure walking out of a nearby government building and was immediately stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never expected Emerald City... to be so small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she wanted to forget someone, she inadvertently kept seeing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina noticed her best friend's strange behavior and followed her gaze. She exclaimed, "It's Jason!" A moment after, Lina looked awkwardly at her best friend again. Lina still remembered the last time she and Grace had met Jason at the temple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had simply regarded Grace as air and completely ignored her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, they had run into Jason again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a figure suddenly rushed toward Jason. However, before they could reach him, they were stopped by his bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, the woman knelt with a thump and kowtowed to Jason repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed, it's my fault. I shouldn't have approached you with a hidden agenda. Please forgive me. I... I dare not do it again. Please!" The woman kowtowed, her head banging the ground again and again as she spoke. Her forehead was soon swollen and grazed.</p></div>
