        <h1>Chapter 4346 Dining Together</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert and Harley walked into the snack shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point in time, there were already quite a few people there, most of whom were students from the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Harley walked into the store, he certainly drew quite a bit of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Firstly, it was because Harley herself was quite attractive. She had a rare blend of elegance and vibrancy in her looks, yet she didn't come off as unapproachable. Instead, it only added to the noble aura of her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Secondly, even though there were no luxury brand logos on the clothes Harley was wearing, you could still tell they weren't cheap. They were different from what an average student would wear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirdly, it was because Harley herself was a celebrity at school. After all, she was the princess of the Hart family. Who didn't know her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they hadn't met in person, the classmates would have seen photos online or somewhere else before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, among the students in the snack shop at that moment, quite a few recognized Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because they recognized Harley that a wave of whispers broke out. After all, to the average person, it was quite strange for the princess of the Hart family to appear in such a small eatery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a spot over there, just take a seat." Harley pointed to a corner and said to Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked up and saw a tiny spot with a small table and two chairs next to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're treating, then I'll just have a burger and a Coke!" Harley said, heading over to take a seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was taken aback as he watched Harley sit down so naturally, without a hint of disdain on his face. A strange emotion began to slowly spread in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Calvert came over with a tray, placing the burger and cola that Harley had ordered in front of her. In front of him, he had a burger of his own, and he'd also bought some fried chicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fried chicken at this place is pretty good, give it a try," Calvert said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fried chicken costs $18 a portion, which Calvert usually wouldn't splurge on. But today, he specifically bought it, hoping Harley would like it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Calvert, fried chicken was a rare treat. But for Harley, it was just simple food, she...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Harley responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a simple response made Calvert feel a sense of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them were quietly eating. Harley had already had two pieces of fried chicken but noticed that Calvert was only eating the burger in front of him and hadn't touched the fried chicken at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like fried chicken?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Calvert quickly denied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't you eating?" Harley asked, even though it was Calvert who told her the fried chicken tasted good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You go ahead and eat. If you're full and there's still some left, I'll eat then," he said quietly. As soon as the words left his mouth, a wave of inferiority washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Calvert will never be able to shake off this sense of inferiority in front of Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you only eating the leftovers? Isn't it better to eat together? If you insist on waiting for me to finish before you start on the leftovers, it actually makes me uncomfortable." Harley's voice rose, "This fried chicken is indeed as delicious as you said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at Calvert with a smile, as if waiting for Calvert to join him for a meal. His gaze didn't carry the air of superiority or condescension often seen in the wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was stunned for a few seconds, then slowly picked up the fork, ready to spear the </span><span>fried chicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice suddenly rang out, "So this is where you've been!"</span></p></div>
