        <h1>Chapter 1762</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"One can recall even forgotten memories. Although... Jay forgot me, he's recalling our past little by little... Brian, I... I'm losing my grip. Hurry... Hurry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's voice became more and more strained. Seeing that Brian had no intention of grabbing her wrist, she glanced at Mason out of the corners of her eyes. He was still unconscious. She gritted her teeth and stretched out her other hand, holding Brian's hand with both hands!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, this pushed her body further toward the sunken ground. If there was another explosion, she would fall as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian watched what Grace was doing in shock. "Do you know what you&rsquo;re doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," she said as a thick layer of sweat covered her forehead. "Brian, you saved me before. I have no reason not to save you... If... If I let go now, I... I can never forgive myself..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sweat trickled down her cheeks and onto his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was just like... how she had pulled his hand back then. Even though it was difficult, she insisted on pulling him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had not changed after all these years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Jason rushed up the hill with his men, he saw Grace desperately gripping Brian's hand with half of her body tilting toward the chasm. She might fall at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He instantly felt a pain in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, without much thought, he rushed forward. He tightly wrapped one arm around Grace's waist while he used the other to grab Brian&rsquo;s wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay!" exclaimed Grace, her voice full of joy and relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was reassured by his presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's men also rushed forward and dragged Brian up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Among them was a small figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed rushed over to the unconscious Mason and picked him up with his small body. "Mommy, why is Lil Bro still asleep? Is he unconscious because he's injured?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one saw the bruises on Mason's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was shocked after seeing her eldest son. "Mick, what are you doing here?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I came to find you and Lil Bro!" the little one said in all seriousness. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But it's too dangerous here!" Grace panicked. The place could explode again at any time. Although she was not afraid of putting herself in danger, she was worried about the safety of her children. She said to Jason, "How could you let him come up with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If I hadn&rsquo;t let him, he would still try to come up himself," said Jason. Rather than have Mick Reed do that, it would be safer to keep his eldest son in his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed said, "I'm not afraid. If Daddy can come up, I can come up too! And I'm going to save Lil Bro. I want to take him home!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knew that his brother had suffered a lot and he never had all the things he had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because he was brought back to his father by the bad man while his brother was not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, the five-year-old Mick Reed had made up his mind. He would protect Lil Bro and let him have everything he had!</p></div>
