        <h1>Chapter 4199</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the next day, Kit took Tina to the mall for shopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When buying baby clothes, Tina seemed very happy, emitting a maternal tenderness that made Kit somewhat mesmerized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Basically, whatever Tina liked, Kit bought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the several large bags filled with stuff, Tina couldn't help but ask, "Did we buy too much? Do you have enough money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, since they started living together, she hasn't seen Kit go out to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Kit had told her before that he had quit the entertainment industry, so now their expenses are all covered by Kit's savings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's enough!" Kit smiled and said, "Don't worry, I have enough money. If it's not enough in the future, I can go out to work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back to being a singer?" she curiously asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, "Just find some ordinary job. But don't worry, there's no problem in supporting you and the baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't plan to return to the entertainment circle, as there were too many dark things happening there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go out to work too when the time comes." Tina smiled and started talking about her dreams for the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They continued talking until they entered the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit listened and felt that it was so wonderful. If it really happens in the future, how great it </span><span>would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, suddenly the elevator stopped abruptly, and Kit immediately had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did the elevator malfunction?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, the lights in the elevator suddenly went out, and the elevator became pitch black.</span></p></div>
