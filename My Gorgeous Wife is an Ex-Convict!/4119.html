        <h1>Chapter 4117</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the bathroom, Tina looked at herself in the mirror above the sink. She wore a sun hat on her head, and the raised collar of her shirt covered her chin. It can be said that most of her face was covered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her from such a distance, can Kit really recognize her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, someone else entered the restroom, and Tina instinctively hid in a stall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Along with the sound of footsteps, came the voices of the newcomers, "Kit's look in this drama is really good. Maybe he'll become even more popular after the show airs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But he's just an idol singer, we don't know how good his acting skills are."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But his looks are enough, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But speaking of it, how did Kit end up with that Tina? Although Tina looks good in her male dress-up photos, didn't Kit say that his ideal type is a petite and cute girl?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, what ideal type? Money can change everything. Tina is the Stephenson family's young lady, and the White Maple Group is worth so much. Although Kit's family background is not bad, it can't compare to the Stephenson family. If the Stephenson family's young lady likes me, I'm willing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was sweating profusely as she listened. Come on, she had no intention of developing a lesbian relationship!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I heard that Kit has a homosexual tendency, so that's why he's involved in a scandal with Tina. After all, since his debut, he hasn't had any scandals with women, and although Tina is a woman, the photos she took are quite androgynous. Some people even believe that she's a pretty boy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hey hey! Tina was even more nervous now. Did they just transition the topic directly to homosexuality?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina really wanted to jump out and tell those two girls who were discussing that there was absolutely no ambiguity between her and Kit, so they didn't have to think in the direction of homosexuality!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, when the voices gradually faded away, Tina walked out of the stall and took a deep breath before leaving the restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, she hadn't walked a few steps when she brushed past several women who were entering the restroom. Then, the voice of a woman sounded, "Hey, that person just now looked a bit like Tina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who's Tina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The one who's involved in a scandal with Kit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Tina quickened her pace, but then she heard hurried footsteps behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh no, could it be that these people are chasing after her to confirm if she really is Tina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina decided to run as fast as she could!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In any case, she couldn't be recognized here. Otherwise, there would be another round of gossip and scandal, and she would have to face her parents' interrogation again. And what about Chandler? Would he misunderstand her again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Tina was not familiar with this area of the film and television city, so she was running around like a headless fly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was about to run into a dead end, a hand suddenly reached out and pulled her to the side!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was startled and was about to struggle, but then a familiar voice rang out, "It's me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She then realized that the person who had just grabbed her was Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the people who were chasing after her had not noticed them squeezed into this hidden crevice and had run past them.</p></div>
