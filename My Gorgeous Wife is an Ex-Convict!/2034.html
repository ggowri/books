        <h1>Chapter 2032</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Make up for it? He wants to make up for it? How many things is he planning on buying for the proposal?' Lina was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they arrived at the Sweeney family&rsquo;s house, Lina unbuckled the seat belt to get down but saw Hadwin Stephenson still sitting in his seat, seemingly in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Aren&rsquo;t you getting out?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As if he just suddenly came back to his senses, he looked at her, took a deep breath, and said, "I'm getting out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when Hadwin Stephenson went upstairs with Lina while carrying so many things, Lina suddenly looked at him and said, "What's the matter? Is it hot? Your forehead is sweating."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said as she held a tissue and slightly stood on her tiptoes to wipe off his sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm nervous," he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nervous?" A look of surprise flashed through her eyes. "Why are you nervous? Haven&rsquo;t you been seeing my parents very often these days? Besides, I'm sure they won't object when you tell them about us getting a marriage license!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Even so, I'm still nervous!' Hadwin Stephenson had always been calm no matter the situation, so he found it unbelievable himself. No matter how big a deal was, he could always face it calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the thought of going to her parents to ask to marry their only daughter made him nervous. He was worried about saying the wrong thing in front of the two elderly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He loved her, so the deeper the love, the more nervous he was and the more he could not bear the risk of losing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm just worried that your parents are still a little dissatisfied with me and don't think I'm the best candidate to be their son-in-law," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina could not help smiling. "You're the best man my parents can ask for to be their son-in-law. Besides, I'm pregnant with your baby. Who else would I marry? I&rsquo;ll still marry you even if they object."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked intently at him, her round eyes full of determination. "I, Lina, will only marry Hadwin Stephenson." Her melodious voice was so powerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The look in her eyes and voice seemed to appease his tension little by little. "I, Hadwin Stephenson, will only marry Lina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They arrived at the Sweeney family&rsquo;s house. Lina had called her parents in advance and told her that Hadwin Stephenson would join them for dinner in the evening, so Mrs. Sweeney had prepared a table full of food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she saw Hadwin Stephenson come in carrying so many things, she politely said, "Hey, why did you bring so many things when we&rsquo;re just having dinner? Are they for Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, they're for you two," said Hadwin Stephenson as he gave them their respective gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the wine, Mr. Sweeney said with a chuckle, "This wine must be expensive. Let's have a nice drink together today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina dared not tell her father that the wine cost more than 100,000 dollars, which was her father&rsquo;s yearly salary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she saw the jewelry Hadwin Stephenson gave her, Mrs. Sweeney exclaimed, "This... This is too expensive. How much does it cost? It must cost hundreds of thousands of dollars!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina wondered whether she should tell her mother it cost 20 million dollars, not hundreds of thousands!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, if she did tell her mom, her mom was probably going to lock the jewelry in the bank safe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "It's alright. You can wear it to attend my and Lina's wedding in the future, Aunt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Wedding?" Mrs. Sweeney froze, and Mr. Sweeney, who had unscrewed the cork of the wine bottle and was pouring it, also looked at Hadwin Stephenson blankly. He totally forgot about the wine.</p></div>
