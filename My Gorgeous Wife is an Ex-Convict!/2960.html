        <h1>Chapter 2958</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Cough cough..." Valda almost choked on her own saliva. "I don't have any acting skills, and besides... even if I wanted to be the leading actress, no director would be interested in me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to, you can," he said with unwavering conviction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was momentarily stunned, but quickly realized that she almost forgot he was the prince of the entertainment industry. In the entertainment industry, there was probably nothing he couldn't do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to?" His voice, once again gentle, sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No...no thanks, I still prefer drawing comics," Valda said hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh my god, so sweet," Camille exaggeratedly said, "Are you trying to torture this single dog to death?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, you should hurry up and find a boyfriend too," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I haven't found the right one yet," Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Should I introduce you to some people?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Valda and Camille both looked at him in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong?" he raised an eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't seem like the kind of person who likes to introduce people to each other," Valda murmured. He seemed more like the kind of person who would watch from the sidelines and not actively take on trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't like it, but you always say she's your best friend, right? In that case, it's natural to be different from others," he said, then turned to Camille and said, "You can tell me your requirements and I'll see if I know anyone suitable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille was a bit slow to react, is the prince really going to introduce her to someone?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Camille thought about the people around the Crown Prince, she realized that she shouldn't aim too high. After all, not everyone can become a Cinderella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thanks, when the time comes that I really can't find someone by my side, I'll trouble you to help me play matchmaker," said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Brian didn't hesitate and continued to help Valda with the vegetables.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing their meal, Camille suddenly turned serious and asked, "Brian, are you serious about Valda this time? You won't hurt her again, will you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked up at Camille, his pitch-black eyes carrying a sense of oppression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Camille faced Grace directly, even though she felt fear in her heart, she couldn't show it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I am serious about Valda. In the future, if she is ever sad, I will only be even sadder than her," said Brian sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you ever do anything to hurt Valda in the future, even if you are the prince, I will definitely stand up for Valda!" said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can't," said Brian. He wouldn't do anything else to hurt Valda, not even one thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Camille finally breathed a sigh of relief and smiled at her friend, saying, "Valda, congratulations on finding such a great boyfriend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's eyes were slightly red, "Thank you, Camille."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This "thank you" is not only a congratulation to her friend, but also a gratitude for all the help she has received from her. When she was going through the darkest time in her life, Camille lent her a hand and helped her fight against campus violence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it weren't for Camille, she wouldn't be who she is today.</p></div>
