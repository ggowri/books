        <h1>Chapter 1447</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Martin Weiss woke up again, there were not only the doctor and nurses but also Jason standing in front of his hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The anesthetic had not yet worn off, so he did not feel much pain in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How is... Kyla doing?" Martin Weiss asked with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The operation went well, but she has to be in the ICU for two days," Jason answered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss heaved a sigh of relief. 'The operation went well. That's good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Even if... I can never show up in front of that woman again, at least she has a part of me in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'My liver will accompany her for the rest of her life until she grows old...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And the bone marrow she gave me will always be with me. Perhaps this is another kind of company!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss said nothing. It was as if he did not care about his health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even when the doctor told him about the post-operative precautions and the effects of the operation on his body, he remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After the doctor and nurses left the ward, Jason said, "Once Kyla Corbyn's case is reversed, there&rsquo;ll be negative news surrounding Weiss Group. I&rsquo;m afraid you'll also be criticized. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll even be detained or sentenced."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know," Martin Weiss said lightly. He had already thought about all the consequences. Even if he was indeed sentenced to prison, he deserved it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had not been bent on revenge and trusted Paisley Daniels, he would not have been misled. He would not have given false testimony in court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His testimony had been taken as conclusive evidence back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was the real executioner!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you going to stop appearing in front of Kyla Corbyn?" Jason asked suddenly. He naturally learned this from Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There's not much I can do for her, and since that's what she wants, I'll try to give it to her." However, every day would be torture for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "Maybe one day she'll let you show up in front of her again. Who knows? After all, you have a child together. I can give you a hand if you need."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Jason with some confusion. After all, the ruler of Emerald City did not seem like the kind of person who would be eager to help others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, he and Jason did not know each other very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As if seeing the doubt in his eyes, Jason said lightly, "Just assume that I sympathize with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sympathize?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Since when was Master Reed so sympathetic?' However, Martin Weiss could not think of any other reason if it was not sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason had no intention of saying anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He sympathized with Martin Weiss, but it was because he saw himself in Martin Weiss. That was why he was willing to give Martin Weiss a hand.</p></div>
