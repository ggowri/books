        <h1>Chapter 663</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before the man could finish, he was already kicked to the ground with one foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, I couldn't control my foot," Jason said lightly, but his left foot stepped on the man's heart, causing the man to immediately cry out in pain. His face was red, but he could not move the foot that was pressed against his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, First Uncle, Second Uncle, and Third Aunt of the Lu family immediately came forward to say, "Mr. Reed, um... You shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this at a funeral."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It would be disrespectful to the dead if anything happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The man only said a few words. Don't take him seriously, Mr. Reed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked lazily at the three people in front of him. "I think if Grandma saw someone insulting her granddaughter like this, she would probably approve of me doing so, wouldn't she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His half-smile sent cold shivers down their backs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, of course, she would!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. This man is just angry that Grace refused his proposal back then, so he's here to make trouble!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is the kind of person who doesn't have the right to attend the funeral. Grace is our family's treasure. How dare he insult her? My mom's favorite has always been Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All three of them spoke, taking sides with Grace. First Uncle called for security and drove the man and his family out of the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those who came to the funeral were stunned. They thought Grace, who had been to prison, was someone they could pick on at will. They did not expect her to have such a tough boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man who picked the fight was blue in the face when he was taken away by the security guards. He whimpered as he clutched his chest. They wondered if the bones in his chest had broken!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing the way the Lu family treated Grace, the guests did not dare to treat her like she was a relative who had been to prison anymore. She was now being treated like a guest of honor, and... It was as if everyone was afraid of upsetting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay looked coldly at Jason and Grace, never realizing that her cousin, an ex-convict, would be so protected by the famous Jason of Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she had been to Emerald City and attended several upper-class banquets with Brian, she got a better understanding of what was so terrible about Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a person like that was so protective of Grace, making her feel a touch of jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was her cousin so lucky? She not only saved Brian when she was a child but was also in a relationship with Sean back then. Even though she was imprisoned and was dumped by Sean, Jason fell in love with her after she got out of prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This made her feel frustrated, as if she could never match up to Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I got a little carried away and disturbed your grandmother's funeral," Jason said to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "As you said, if Grandma knew that people are insulting me like that, she would approve of what you just did."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew he was protecting her, even if his actions seemed a little too violent to some. However, that was how the world worked. If you were any weaker, people would push their luck even further.</p></div>
