        <h1>Chapter 2996</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, these words made Linda and Taylah frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially Linda, who was once the school's beauty, everyone who saw her would flatter and fawn over her. Suddenly, it seemed like all the attention was on Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's just a manga artist, what's the big deal? Even if you become a manga artist, you won't make much money," Linda said disdainfully. "I'm telling you younger students, drawing manga is just for fun. If you really want to become a manga artist, your life will be difficult!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Exactly, the domestic comic environment is not good. There are many comic artists who may seem successful on the surface, but behind the scenes, they may be worrying about their livelihood every day!" Taylah agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was not like that," murmured a student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Otherwise, why don't you ask your friend Valda how much she earns in a year!" Linda taunted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I earn how much, it seems to have nothing to do with you," Valda said to Linda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, what's with your attitude?" Taylah scolded. "You're just a comic artist. Do you even know how much Linda earns annually now? She's already a project manager in a big company. In a few years, she'll be a project director. She's much better than you, just a comic artist!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I just think that if you draw comics, your life will inevitably be harder. Look at my subordinates, those college graduates, their starting salary is over 8000. Once they pass the first year, they can earn around 20,000 per month. Isn't this much better than working hard to draw comics?" Linda said, her gaze falling on those students again. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Moreover, even if the comic is drawn very well, only a few top-level artists can truly make money. Most comic artists may not live as well as ordinary office workers!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sarcasm in that tone couldn't be more obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The students from the manga club all seem to have unhappy expressions now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, some students from other clubs in the same room gathered around to watch the excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some students became curious after hearing that Linda's recent graduates were able to earn so much money, and asked Linda about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Linda smiled smugly, feeling pleased with herself. As long as she was around, she knew she could outshine Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What's so great about a cartoonist who has drawn a few comics?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In any profession, only a few can make money, and most people may be just ordinary. But that doesn't mean they can't have dreams. Who knows, among these students, there may be a top figure in the comic industry in the future? The future is full of possibilities, and I don't think making money can measure everything," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're just talking pretty, anyone can talk like that!" Linda said disdainfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda ignored Linda and spoke to the students in the manga club, saying, "Manga is your hobby, and not every hobby can become a means of making a living. However, if you truly enjoy it, then this hobby can bring us happiness that cannot be bought with any amount of money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like me, because I love drawing cartoons and weaving stories in my mind, I am usually very happy when I work. Of course, there are also times when I feel frustrated, such as when I can't draw what I envision or when my work is rejected. However, overall, I feel that happiness outweighs the frustrations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So I persisted, and although I can't say I've achieved great success, I'm very satisfied with my life now. As for your future, I don't know how many of you will enter the field of comics, but having more hobbies and interests will make life happier, won't it? If any of you want to become a comic artist in the future, I can offer some help while you also focus on your studies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's words immediately drew applause from the students in the comic club, while Linda's expression turned unpleasant upon seeing this.</p></div>
