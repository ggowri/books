        <h1>Chapter 2849</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Brian wanted to fall in love with anyone, it should be her. She looked like Grace the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Whitney Cooper came to Valda Theller's studio. After seeing Valda Theller, she said, "Do you have a minute? There's something I wanted to talk to you about, Miss Theller."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Valda Theller looked at her suspiciously. At first glance, she mistook her for Grace, but she could see their differences on closer inspection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was now pregnant and resting at home, but the woman in front of her was slim and had a flat belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Whitney Cooper, Brian's secretary abroad. There's something about Brian I wish to tell you. Don't you want to find out?" said Whitney Cooper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned. 'She&rsquo;s addressing Brian by his first name. Is she close to Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jealousy spread in her heart as she thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks, I'll ask Brian myself if there's anything I want to know about him. I don't need others to tell me. Miss Cooper, please leave if there's nothing else," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you've asked Brian about Grace yourself?" Whitney Cooper asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze, and the expression on her face changed. What she knew about Grace and Brian was from online, other people, or her speculation. She had never asked him herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was like a taboo topic between them. It was an elephant in the room, but she could never ask about it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper smiled at this. "It seems you've never asked about it. In that case, I can tell you some information. If you don't want to go outside with me, I can say it here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned. "I said I'll ask myself if I want to know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper walked casually to the bookshelf nearby. She flipped through the comics on the bookshelf and said, "You must be smug these days. Brian spent 100 million dollars on your portrait. Do you think he loves you? How funny. Do you know how deep his feelings for Grace are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pressed her lips tightly. 'Of course, I know. How can I not know?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace likes purple gowns, so he never lets the women around him wear purple gowns. The food he likes is also food that Grace likes. He has Grace's photos on his phone, so no one is allowed to touch his phone. He&rsquo;ll also remember everything Grace has said to him for the rest of his life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper said and turned to look at Valda Theller. "I don't think you've worn a purple gown in front of him before, nor have you looked through his phone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Valda Theller quivered subtly. "What are you trying to say? Are you trying to sow discord to ruin our relationship?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper said, "I just want you to recognize reality. Don't you think I look like Grace? Because of my face, he didn't hesitate to save me when I was in trouble and made me his private secretary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper said with a smile on her lips as if she was recalling the good old days. "He used to fall into a trance when he looked at me. He would even... hug me and tell me about his past and obsession with Grace, which he probably never told you about!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper seemed to be provoking her with every word she said. Valda Theller only felt her chest being stuffy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So? What are you trying to say?" Valda Theller took a deep breath and said, not wanting to show weakness in front of this woman. "If you think you&rsquo;ll cause any conflict between Brian and me and affect our relationship by saying this, it's just wishful thinking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to clarify that you don't look like Grace! He won't love you at all! I don't know why Brian wants people to think you're his girlfriend, but I think there must be a reason for this. Don't you want to know?" Whitney Cooper said. All she had to do today was plant a seed of doubt.</p></div>
