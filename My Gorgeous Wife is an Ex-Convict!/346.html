        <h1>Chapter 345</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly opened his eyes and looked at her. She... returned, panting just like before. Even though she was afraid of him, disgusted with him, and perhaps even hated him, she did not want him to hurt? At the thought of this, it seemed that even the pain in his body had become much less intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason cooperated by opening his lips and swallowing the medicine Grace fed him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes fell on his lips, and sure enough, there were distinct teeth marks on his lips. He must have been in such severe pain that he bit his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you look at me like that again, you'll make me think you want to kiss me." Jason's voice rang. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately came to herself, her face turning red all of a sudden. "I just saw that you bit your lip. I didn't mean anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&hellip; doesn't matter if you mean anything else. You can kiss me whenever you want, Sis," he said. Though his face was still pale and his forehead was still covered with a layer of thin sweat, he did not stammer as he had before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned away from looking at Jason's face to avoid herself from getting any redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes went to the spirit tablet placed on the table in front of her. The incense was still burning, but it was almost done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to burn any more incense? The current one is nearly burnt out," said Grace. Generally speaking, the burning of the incense could not be broken until the worship was over. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tonight... Looking at the burning incense and candles, as well as offerings of food and fruits, he should be worshipping his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason heard this and made a gesture to stand up, but Grace quickly pressed on his shoulder and said, "Don't move, I'll do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she went to the table, picked up the incense, and leaned close to the candle to light it. Then, she held the incense as she looked at the man in the black and white photo before bowing three times. She put it in the incense burner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes seemed to flicker with surprise. For a moment, he looked at the woman in front of him in awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not expect her to bow to his father. He could see some of her profile from his point of view. He could not see her face very well, but he could feel that she was serious with the three bows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did his father... see her? This was the woman he liked, and later he would tie this woman to his side. He would make her inseparable from him and make her as dependent on him as fish was on the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not repeat his father's mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After putting in the incense, Grace turned around and caught Jason's eyes. She immediately felt a little awkward. "Well&hellip; Is that a photo of your mother?" she asked as she was at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she felt a little regretful after finishing the question! During the time they had spent together, she knew that his mother was someone he did not want to talk about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was thinking of hurrying on to another topic when he replied, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned as she had not expected an actual answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think she's pretty?" he asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a nod. To be fair, his mother was beautiful and her beauty was absolutely impressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she is. My father loved her so much that he took her words as imperial edicts. He would do everything in his power to get whatever she wanted," he said darkly. "However, one day, when the man who could have given anything she wanted ran away from home for her and could no longer give her all those fine things in life, he was nothing but a worthless man to her."</p></div>
