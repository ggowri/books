        <h1>Chapter 146</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's body froze. "That's right. Even if I yell right now, who is going to barge in and save me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Saving me would be going against Jason. Who would be so stupid?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she snapped out of her trance, his lips were kissing hers and he pried open her teeth, tasting all of her sweetness.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No! I don't want it to be like this!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Almost subconsciously, she suddenly bit him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the next moment, Grace's mouth was flooded with a bloody taste and she was taken aback. "That's... Jason's blood. I know, I just bit his tongue."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even so, he continued to kiss her, assertively forcing her to swallow his blood!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She did not know how much time had passed. When the kiss ended, her lips felt numb and the bloody taste in her mouth was very strong.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Did it taste good?" he asked quietly. The corners of his lips were raised and a trickle of blood was slowly flowing down from one side of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His faint smile was complemented by the dark red blood, making it seem extra bright.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She opened her mouth to speak but the taste of blood grew even stronger and saliva mixed with blood similarly trickled down from the corners of her lips.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He raised a finger and gently wiped away the redness at the corner of her lips. "As a matter of fact, this is the first time a woman has drunk my blood. Sister, you have truly proven yourself to be the exception to many of my rules."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let me go, please," she begged with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you that unwilling to stay by my side?" he asked, his fingers gently stroking her beautiful head of hair.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His movements were tender but her body could not help shivering and her hair stood on end.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I just want to... live my life peacefully." Every time she swallowed, it felt as if she was drinking his blood.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So staying by my side wouldn't be peaceful?" he asked smilingly. He reached out his fingers and abruptly tore at her clothes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, her shoulder was exposed to the open air.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's entire body stiffened suddenly and she hastily shut her eyes, not moving at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Since there's no use in struggling, the only thing I can do is to endure it passively.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I already understood this principle when I was in jail."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She could feel his lips kissing her neck and collarbone while his fingers touched her skin...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Bear with it, bear with it. Pretend he's Jason and not Jason!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She mentally repeated that sentiment to herself but it was as if she was devoid of willpower and unable to restrain herself. She shivered even more violently until a nauseous feeling mixed with the stench of the blood rose within her...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Uh!" Grace abruptly opened her eyes and covered her mouth with her hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, she felt the force on her loosening and she hurriedly got out of bed to rush to the toilet. She leaned over the sink and started to throw up unceasingly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She retched over the sink. She had not had much to eat that day and her stomach was empty so she only vomited some bile and nothing else.</p></div>
