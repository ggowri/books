        <h1>Chapter 1089</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even though she doesn&rsquo;t love me, she's now with me, isn't she?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt a heavy weight on one side of her shoulder. Part of his weight was now on her shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was like a man exhausted to the core, looking for some support&mdash;even if it was only temporary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to be his support, his only support in this world. If she pushed him away, it was as if he would fall off a precipice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'God, how could I have such an idea?' thought Grace as she laughed at herself. She could never be his only support. It was only a delusion given by his weariness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... You should rest. I'll go back to my room," said Grace as she tried to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, with a spin, he had suddenly pinned her down on the bed before she could take a step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me go!" She tried to push him away in a panic, but he only held her tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't do anything to you. I'm just&hellip; going to hold you like this," he muttered as he buried his face against her shoulders, taking in her scent and temperature almost greedily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if this was the only way to fill the space in his heart, to reassure him that he could... go to sleep...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened as she was worried that Jason might do something to her, but he just held her... as he said he would!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he held her in his arms tightly like a child holding their favorite toy. She could not break free at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides... Even if she did break free, he could probably use force to keep her in his arms if he wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened in Jason's arms while her hand was pressed against his chest. Unobstructed by clothes, she touched his skin directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands felt hotter and hotter... However, he held her so tightly that she could not even move her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She distracted herself by thinking of irrelevant things. In the end, she simply recited legal provisions in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, Grace heard the sound of Jason's even breathing. The arms around her loosened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated for a moment and asked softly, "Jason, are you... asleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What answered her was still the sound of even breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he... asleep or not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He said he couldn't sleep, but now... He fell asleep just like that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surprised, but it was probably a good thing for her that he was asleep now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She moved her body carefully and gently lifted his arms. She managed to move most of her body with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did she finally get a good look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was sleeping soundly. Otherwise, with his alertness, he would have woken up! It seemed that he was really having trouble sleeping these days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lowered her head to look at him as he slept. His closed eyelids covered those bright eyes, and his long eyelashes added beauty to his sleeping face. The thin lips under his high nose bridge were shut lightly while tinted with a light rosy color.</p></div>
