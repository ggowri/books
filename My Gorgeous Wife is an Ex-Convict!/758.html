        <h1>Chapter 757</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the dream, the little boy misstepped and slipped on the edge of the cliff. The little girl instinctively pulled the boy and both of them ended up sliding down together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little girl held on to the little boy's hand and did not let it go. Then, she pulled the little boy up with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked to the edge of the cliff and looked down warily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This side of the cliff was relatively steep. It was pretty dangerous, even for adults. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If you accidentally fell, you would break a few bones even if your life was not in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, Grace stepped back a few more steps, getting away from the edge of the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had not mistaken her for someone else. He recognized her, but she no longer remembered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she began to remember him, he mistook someone else for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be a secret&ndash;A secret buried in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, there was a cracking sound like a foot stepping on the twig on the ground. Grace turned her head around, and to her surprise, she found Brian here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was wearing the same black suit and white shirt. The only thing different from when he got out of the Lu family's house was that he had a long stick of candied haws in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the candied haws were still wrapped in a layer of plastic wrap which had not been opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon seeing her, a flash of surprise also came over his indifferent face. "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm... Supposed to be the one asking you that!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked behind Brian, and there was no sign of Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sis didn't come up the hill with Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here?" he asked with a slight frown and took a step nearer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was offering incense to my grandmother's grave on the nearby hill and followed the path here," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes stared at her. Brian's voice was cold. "What I asked was why are you 'here'?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is she here in a place that means so much to me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The questioning at the hospital's exit passageway that day was clear. She was not! He had mistaken everything. It was his mistake to think she was &lsquo;her&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Stella Lindsay who saved his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he finally calmed down and could ignore her, she suddenly appeared at this very spot. This threw a boulder into his calm heart, causing ripples in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Brian's eyes, Grace suddenly shuddered and realized what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He... Was asking why she was so &lsquo;coincidentally&rsquo; standing on the edge of the cliff where the accident happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not admit anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Things would only get messier if she did!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I don't know what you're talking about. I just walked here by accident. Can't I come here?" she asked while pretending not to understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes darkened, and he could not help laughing at himself. 'What kind of reply was I expecting?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't mean anything to you, but it's different for me." He also walked to the edge of the cliff and was looking at the slightly steep cliff.</p></div>
