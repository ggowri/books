        <h1>Chapter 3470</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing her club activities as usual, Veronica walked out of the school gate at the end of the day. However, she noticed that the Reed family's car was still parked at the entrance and had not driven away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason was standing at the school gate, his beautiful dark eyes fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Veronica's footsteps paused as if she had seen something from many years ago. Back then, before he started school, she would see him waiting for her at the school gate every day after she finished classes. He was just a small figure crouching there, eagerly waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if it's windy and rainy, even if he's covered in bruises, he will still come to wait for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's nose suddenly felt a bit sour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The closer they were, the more they relied on each other, the more naive and ridiculous she seemed, and the more intense her pain became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica avoided starting a conversation and didn't look at Mason. Instead, she lifted her feet and tried to walk past him and move forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had only taken a few steps when Mason stopped her and said, "Veronica, please don't ignore me, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "I want to go home, please move aside first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica..." He reached out and grabbed her sleeve, just like when they were kids. Whenever she got mad at him for something, he would always do this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And whenever he does this, she always forgets everything that was bothering her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time - "If you really treated me as Veronica, you wouldn't treat me like this! Mason, you've made me truly understand what the Reed family is, and who the second son of the Reed family is! There will always be a difference between us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the difference?" he asked. "I know you're angry, angry that I caused you and Daniel to break up, but that was Daniel's own choice. He chose money over his feelings for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica gave a bitter smile. "You don't understand what I'm really angry about!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she tried to pull her dress away from his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then tell me, what are you really angry about?" he asked, stubbornly refusing to let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's you," she glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, more and more students were coming out onto the campus, and everyone's attention was drawn to them as they struggled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica knew that if she didn't make things clear with Mason today, he would probably stand with her at the school gate all day, as he never cared about other people's opinions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's find somewhere else to talk, not stand at the school gate," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he obediently agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He directly took her hand and led her into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car shields us from the outside gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason asked, "Where does Veronica want to meet me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Find a quiet place where no one will disturb us," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he replied, then instructed the driver to drive to a restaurant. They arrived at the entrance and he led her to a private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The soundproofing of the private room is excellent. Inside the room, you won't hear any noise from outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this place okay? Veronica has been here before and really liked the desserts. Today, she can eat more," he said and proceeded to order some dishes from the waiter standing nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica realized that all the dishes he ordered were her favorites!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He always knows her preferences, what colors she likes, what dishes she loves to eat, and what habitual movements she has.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knows everything about her too well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But how could he not know that by manipulating her feelings like this, she would become so disgusted with him?!</p></div>
