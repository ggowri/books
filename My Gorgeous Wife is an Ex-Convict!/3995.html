        <h1>Chapter 3993</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Irene raised her hand to touch the other person's body, a sudden force made her body sink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she realized what was happening, her face was already pressed against the coffee table, her hands were tied behind her back, and she was kneeling on the ground in a sorry state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the person who was restraining her at the moment was not Mick, but a...strange man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reed! How should we deal with her?" the man asked Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Throw her out and take this bottle of wine to be tested," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," the man replied, grabbing Irene and preparing to drag her out of the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Irene shouted anxiously. Why was everything going so differently from what she had planned?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she was dragged out of the private room looking like this, she would never be able to stay in this hotel again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What puzzled her even more was who this man was who had subdued her and when he had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadn't everyone left the private room? Why was this person still here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, if you really throw me out, how are you going to solve your physical problem now? I...I can help you solve it. Isn't that good?" Irene's voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that you have quite the nerve. At a time like this, you can still say such things!" Mick said disgustedly, then ordered the man, "Don't take the wine out, just feed it to her. Make her drink all the remaining wine and then throw her out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Irene was shocked and horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had drugged the wine, so she knew very well what kind of effect it would have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they really made her drink all the remaining wine and then threw her out, what would happen to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Irene's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, I was wrong. I...I was wrong. I won't dare to do it again next time. Please...please spare me! We are like siblings, spare me!" she pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her pleading did not move Mick's face in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Irene, we are not siblings, and when you plotted against me, you should have thought about the consequences," said Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can you spare Nancy, but not me? I just wanted to be closer to you, but Nancy used you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Mick suddenly shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was becoming more and more uncomfortable, and Irene's constant mention of Nancy was making him more and more irritable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He directly ordered Irene's bodyguard who was holding her, "Give her alcohol!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard picked up the bottle and poured all the remaining alcohol into Irene's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick watched this scene in front of him, but in his mind, he saw the scene where Nancy was forcibly given alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, watching Nancy being forced to drink, he felt a sharp pain in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to use all his self-control to maintain his cold indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He repeatedly told himself in his heart that the woman was just someone who betrayed and deceived him, and was not worthy of sympathy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, watching Irene being given alcohol, all he felt was disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, all the alcohol was consumed, and the bodyguard carried Irene out of the private room. Mick's command was, "Guard the door of the private room and don't let anyone in."</span></p></div>
