        <h1>Chapter 2041</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, don't mind Chase Harper. Even if you think he's a good guy, don't mind him..." he muttered as his sexy thin lips kissed the corner of her lips. He brushed his lips across her thin lips, then down to her collarbone&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace gasped and shivered gently. His kiss tickled her senses as he knew her body better than anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, are you... Are you jealous again?" she asked with a slight pant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He paused and said in a whisper, "What are you going to do if I say I'm jealous again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What am I going to do?' Grace blushed slightly. Then, she suddenly turned over and pressed Jason under her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His bright peach blossom eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She lowered her head as she ran her fingers gently over his face and said in a low panting voice, "Then I'll try my best to tell you how much I love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This time, she made the first move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She bent over and kissed the corners of his eyes. Then, she went down the bridge of his nose and eventually reached his lips. Her fingers undid his robe little by little...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After she calmed him down, she said, "You know that I love you the most, yet you're still jealous. I just feel sorry for the state of Chase Harper's marriage. He's such a nice man but has an unhappy marriage. He's now divorced from his wife with a three-year-old girl."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said and kissed Jason on the cheek. "You're always jealous that it makes me feel as if I don&rsquo;t express my love to you enough that you feel insecure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared at her. Even now, he would sometimes feel insecure because he loved her so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew she would risk her life for him but still did not want her to care about other men. He domineeringly wanted all of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you think it's too exhausting to be with me?" he asked in a mutter, afraid his love would suffocate her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was afraid he wanted too much, and she would be overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just think I have to love you more," Grace said with a smile and kissed Jason's lips again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How could she not love this man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla suddenly shuddered and looked around. She realized she had been overthinking and no one was staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What's wrong with me? It feels as if someone's watching me from a distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Martin Weiss has already left Emerald City and returned to the Weiss family&rsquo;s house. There's no way he&rsquo;d keep looking at me from afar in silence. Besides, this feeling isn&rsquo;t the same as the feeling of Martin Weiss watching me in secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;I must just be nervous,' she thought to herself. Perhaps Nelson's bullying incident at school had put her on edge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, I'll go restock. You look after the store," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," replied Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla then rode her electric tricycle toward the small market in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The store needed to be restocked once a week. Once she reached the market, Kyla skillfully found the old sellers to restock the goods her store needed. </p></div>
