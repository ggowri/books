        <h1>Chapter 1785</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She froze. She... did not know how to refute that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What he said next almost made her faint. "This is proof. In case you default in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What... What do you mean?" she snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Aren&rsquo;t you eating here with me today because you want to compensate for my car&rsquo;s damages?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm not going to default. I&rsquo;ll just ask you for a discount when you set the compensation fees," Lina retorted in a mumble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So you're not going to default on this, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So, are you going to take responsibility for me too?" His thin lips parted slightly, and his dark eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His gaze was full of emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina felt as if she was trapped in Hadwin Stephenson's words. She chuckled dryly and hurriedly lowered her head to continue eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A touch of disappointment flashed across Hadwin Stephenson's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does she... still refuse to be with me? Even though she's pregnant with my baby, she still resists me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The blood curse in his body had not been removed. Once it was completely removed and there were no more obstacles or danger between them, he... would come clean to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After the meal, Lina felt like she had survived a disaster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "Let me send you home. I'll have the driver bring your car over to return it to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What... What about the damages?" She had not forgotten the ultimate goal of her meal with him today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He saw her eager eyes and asked, "When's your next pregnancy check-up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Huh?" She was stunned by his sudden question. These two things were not relevant at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"In two weeks," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I'll accompany you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What?' She was startled. "You're... You're accompanying me?" She was even stammering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is there a problem?" he asked lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Of course, there's a problem, and it's a huge problem. If he accompanies me to my pregnancy check-up, then the whole world will know that I'm pregnant with his baby!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I can go alone, so don't bother." She smiled dryly and reminded him again, "About the car damages..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll accompany you to your pregnancy check-up in two weeks, and we can talk about the car damages then," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could not help whining in her heart... 'Do I have to wait another two weeks? And the biggest problem is that... he's going to accompany me for the pregnancy check-up.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina grimaced as she got into Hadwin Stephenson's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car drove to the entrance of Lina's apartment. She opened the door and was about to get down when Hadwin Stephenson suddenly reached out to grab her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." She looked at him with some surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, even God wants us to get back together, right?" He smiled slightly, but for some reason, his face seemed pale. However, a gleam of light could be seen in his eyes.</p></div>
