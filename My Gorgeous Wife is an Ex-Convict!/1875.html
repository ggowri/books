        <h1>Chapter 1873</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Watts has been regretting it, and she&rsquo;s been thinking about you all these years&mdash;" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He interrupted her and said, "Don't mention her again. I don't want to hear about her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to go on but paused and said no more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The children were already asleep when they got back to Reed Residence. Grace and Jason went back to their bedroom. When Jason changed out of his clothes, she caught sight of the scar on his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She felt another pang in her heart. The scar was so glaring that it represented the pain he had suffered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'With current medical technology, he could have removed a scar like that with a laser procedure, but he kept it on his body. Did he do that to remind himself not to forget the pain his mother caused him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, is this really going to make you happy?" Grace asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" He turned to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She walked up to him and raised her hand to gently stroke the scar on his chest. "Are you really happy never letting go of the past?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stiffened and gave her a complicated look. "What's the matter? Are you going to plead for her again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I want Mrs. Watts to get what she deserves, but I also want you to let go of the past. You&rsquo;ll never be happy if you don't move on," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll be able to move on when the woman gets the punishment she deserves," he said, pulling her hand down and turning around to enter the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace pulled out her phone from the side of her body and frowned at the text message she received today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had asked Brian's men to find her mentor and his wife's whereabouts. Today, they told her that they had found them. It turned out they were in a shabby apartment not far from the street where Jay's father died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts was in a bad condition. Her fever had reached the point where she would faint at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's men were guarding the apartment, and meals were delivered to them daily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's brows furrowed deeply. They must send Mrs. Watts to the hospital now, or she might die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want Mrs. Watts to die, let alone let Jay kill his own mother. It would be so sad if that happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, he would have no opportunity to atone if he regretted it after she died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was just like how Mrs. Watts's mistake had caused Jay's father to die. Even though Mrs. Watts regretted it countless times afterward, it was pointless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Finally, Grace seemed to have made up her mind. She texted them back and put her phone away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She walked straight to the bathroom and opened the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The mist blinded her eyes, and she heard the sound of water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason was under the showerhead. Grace instantly caught sight of his body. Doubt seemed to flash across his dark peach blossom eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace quickly stepped forward, threw her arms around his neck, stood on tiptoes, and kissed him hard on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The warm water poured on her, making her wet.</p></div>
