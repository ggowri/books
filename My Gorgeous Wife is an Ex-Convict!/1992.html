        <h1>Chapter 1990</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I also want to tell her that for some reason, I have a feeling that someone is watching me these days but whenever I turn around to look, I can't see anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I imagining things?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But if someone&rsquo;s watching me, who is it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As he thought of it, Jasper turned over and the blanket around her loosened a little. One of her hands was fumbling around as usual, and when it touched his hand, she quieted down again and stopped moving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William carefully covered Jasper with the blanket with his free hand before lying down on her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Under the blanket, their two little hands clasped together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wondered how long he could sleep with her like this every night. He also knew that he was a boy and she was a girl. They should sleep separately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, his mother had harmed her family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he hoped it would last longer! He liked having her sleep beside him and having her hand instinctively grasp his to fall asleep soundly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if... he was needed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps no one in the world needed him. Perhaps he was nothing but a mere nuisance, but she needed him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That was all that mattered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the other hand, a man stood in front of the French window of a presidential suite, gazing down condescendingly at the neon lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the coffee table behind him was a DNA report of the two blood samples submitted. They were father and son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough... That was his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The man whispered, "William?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Who would have thought that he would get a child from the night he got into trouble in tMason Swansonty? The child's biological mother, Lily&mdash;whom he had investigated and perhaps disdained the most&mdash;had died in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Regardless, Lily did a good thing by leaving the Barlow family a child with their bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Had it not been for the hospital examinations, he would have no idea that the people close to him had been drugging him over the years to cut off the Barlow family's bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would never have another child of his own blood. In other words, William would be his only biological child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Since the child was his flesh and blood, he had to bring him back to the Barlow family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The man took out his phone and dialed a number. "Make the arrangements. I want to see the kid tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," the person on the other end of the line answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, William met a stranger in one of the kindergarten&rsquo;s rooms while the children were taking their naps.</p></div>
