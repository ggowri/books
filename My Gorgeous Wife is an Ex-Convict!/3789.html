        <h1>Chapter 3787</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for her home...when she returned to her small apartment, it was dark and cold, and he wasn't there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So where could he be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept thinking and suddenly remembered when they were walking around at the </span><span>Stanford University festival, they talked about their childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mentioned how when she was in elementary school and he wasn't old enough to attend yet, he would wait for her at the school gate every day after class and they would walk home together holding hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he was just a child staying with her family and was often beaten by his father and stepmother, so he always had injuries. It was a difficult time for them, but they relied on each other and it was also a warm memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also said that if they had the chance, they would go back to the school area to take a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be...that Mason went there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But other than there, she couldn't think of any other place he might go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Veronica quickly ran out of her apartment, hailed a taxi, and gave the driver the address of her old elementary school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will he come? Where will he come?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she couldn't find him despite wanting to see him, she felt so anxious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the taxi stopped in front of the elementary school, Veronica paid and hurriedly got off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the sky had completely darkened, and the moon in the sky was like a veil, making it difficult to see clearly. In the dark night covered by thick clouds, only a few scattered stars twinkled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elementary school was still similar to what she remembered, except that some of the buildings seemed to have changed when she looked through the iron gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was no one standing at the school gate, it was empty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Mason didn't come here?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's heart sank, and a sense of emptiness swept over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood dumbly at the entrance of the campus, looking at the iron gate in front of her. There were many memories of her and Mason here. Whenever she walked to the school gate after school, her eyes would unconsciously search for that familiar figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if seeing that figure would make her feel at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, where was that figure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she and Mason got back together, she had made up her mind in her heart that there should be no more misunderstandings between them, and they should not separate because of misunderstandings like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, would it be the same as before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she heard footsteps behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a quiet moment, the footsteps behind her became even more pronounced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica shuddered and stiffened up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone was approaching?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was night and the place was a bit secluded, it wasn't too late yet, so there shouldn't be... any danger, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly turned around and saw a familiar figure, causing her to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was different from usual. At this moment, he exuded a coldness, as if he was wrapped in ice, giving off a feeling of keeping people at a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just like... when he first came to the Barlow family and she first saw him, she felt the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here?" His cold voice rang out as he looked at her with indifferent eyes in the darkness.</span></p></div>
