        <h1>Chapter 2303</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could get on with her life, and not much would change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she happened to run into Kyla and found out that she was doing better than herself, which caused her to have a change of plans. That was how she ended up like this. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never expected this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She ended up in prison again after finally making it out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't come to hear you say these. I just want to know where Amber Mitchell is," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman taunted, saying, "You really care about Amber Mitchell! Amber Mitchell helped you in prison and I helped you too! Why won't you repay my kindness? Is this how you treat me? I had to ask Neal Reid to see you several times to make you see me, and Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s name had to be brought up before you would see me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you did help me, and I'm grateful. However, you don't want my gratitude. You&rsquo;re so greedy that you were even willing to hurt me. Jacqueline Bowman, how could you and Amber Mitchell be the same?" Kyla said without mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman said fiercely, "I just want what I deserve! I helped you when we were in prison. Now that you've married a wealthy man, you should repay me well. If you hadn&rsquo;t repeatedly rejected me, would I have taken things so far? Kyla, you forced me to do all that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You forced yourself. One will often end up with nothing when one is too greedy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well said, but who in this world isn't greedy? Some people just fail!" said Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stared at her. "I'm just asking you where Amber Mitchell is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha, you want Amber Mitchell's whereabouts? Okay, let me out and I'll tell you where Amber Mitchell is once I get out," Jacqueline Bowman said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was not surprised that she would make such a negotiation. After all, she had thought about it on her way here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your case is already a criminal case, and I'm not in the position to get you out. But I can write a memorandum of understanding and find you a good lawyer so that you can take a few years off your sentence," said Kyla. It was the best she could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jacqueline Bowman was not content. "What? A few years off? Kyla, are you looking down on me? Find a way to get me acquitted, or you can forget about finding out Amber Mitchell's whereabouts!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her coldly, got up, and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman suddenly said, "Don't you care if Amber Mitchell is suffering right now? Kyla, it seems you're really cold-blooded, huh? You don't care about how miserable the people who previously helped you are after marrying a wealthy man!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did you say?" Kyla paused and turned to look at Jacqueline Bowman again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell is suffering right now. People think she's crazy. She's being abused but can't fight for herself. She seems to be living in hell. After all, not everyone is lucky enough like you to marry Martin Weiss after getting out of prison!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes constricted. She could hardly believe what she heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was smart. She was able to cover her tracks back then! How could she... end up so miserably?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're lying!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha, why would I lie to you? I&rsquo;m speaking the truth. You may let the law punish me if you don't care about her misery! But if you want to know where she is, get me out of here!" Jacqueline Bowman spoke so firmly that there was no room for negotiation.</p></div>
