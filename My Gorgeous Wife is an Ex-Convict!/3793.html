        <h1>Chapter 3791</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is something wrong?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yesterday, after Mason came home, he said he broke up with Sister Veronica," Jasper said. "I was really confused. They seemed to have a good relationship before, didn't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Mason say why they broke up?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He said he was tired," Jasper said. "Breaking up for this reason is just ridiculous! Should I go and ask him what really happened? But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper hesitated. Although she really wanted to find out what happened between Mason and Sister Veronica, they rarely talked about relationship issues, and Mason was generally a man of few words. She didn't know how to broach the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Sister Veronica, Jasper had sent a tentative text message to her earlier in the day, but she hadn't replied. Jasper didn't want to ask again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, based on yesterday's situation, it seemed that Mason had dumped Sister Veronica. He said he was tired, so they broke up. Sister Veronica seemed to be the unlucky victim! She was probably very upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me ask your Mason," William said, noticing Jasper's hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ask him?" Jasper was surprised. "Will Mason tell you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the triplets, William and Mason had the weakest relationship. They only exchanged a few greetings every time they met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As a guy, there might be some things that are easier to talk about," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper thought about it and nodded. "That would be great. I really don't know what happened between them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not a bother. It's only natural for a boyfriend to help his girlfriend in times of trouble," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suddenly hugged William's waist and buried her face in his chest. "Let's never break up for no reason like this again. And you can't say things like 'I'm tired' like </span><span>Mason did!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William hugged Jasper back with both arms. "We will never have a day of breaking up, so you can't think about these things. I will never say 'break up' to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if one day in the future, she comes to him to say goodbye, he will desperately try to keep her, make her change her mind, and be with him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chose him, which is the luckiest thing in his life, so he will cherish this luck even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the afternoon, on his way to find Mason, William ran into Lawrence on the school's tree-lined path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment they passed each other, William suddenly said, "Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence paused. "What's up, Mr. Barlow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William suddenly raised his hand and punched Lawrence in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence stumbled back two steps and touched his mouth, which was bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat, "Mr. Barlow, do you want to be punished by the school for hitting someone? Or do you think the Barlow family's donation to the school can easily solve this matter without any consequences?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Punished?" William sneered. "It doesn't matter if I'm punished! I just want you to understand that if you ever dare to force Jasper again and do anything excessive to her, I will not let you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence suddenly laughed. "Did she tell you? That I kissed her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's face turned ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lawrence seemed even more pleased. "Speaking of which, her lips are really soft. Kissing her feels great..."</span></p></div>
