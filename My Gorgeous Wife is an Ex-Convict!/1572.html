        <h1>Chapter 1570</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Anthony Sherman's car drove over. He was surprised to see Hadwin Stephenson standing beside Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Hadwin Stephenson was not a celebrity, Anthony Sherman's company happened to be working with Stephenson Group. As a mid-level employee in the company, Anthony Sherman had seen photos of Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina also saw Anthony Sherman and waved her hand at Hadwin Stephenson, saying in between hiccups, "Okay... I... I'm getting in the car... Goodbye..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She opened the passenger door and got in the car as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the next moment, Hadwin Stephenson instantly grabbed Lina's hand and forcibly pulled her away from the car. He said to Anthony Sherman who was in the car, "Go. I'll send her home today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Without waiting for Anthony Sherman to speak, Hadwin Stephenson dragged Lina toward his car that was parked on the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson... Let... Let me go..." shouted Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her shouts made Anthony Sherman more sure that this man was indeed Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, why was the president of Stephenson Group here? The way he had talked to him... was almost like... he was jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jealous? Is Hadwin Stephenson jealous of me?' Anthony Sherman shuddered at the thought of this possibility, and a thought flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is Hadwin Stephenson... Lina's ex-boyfriend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If this is true... maybe Hadwin Stephenson isn't that in love with that person from the Jackson family after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Maybe Hadwin Stephenson... still has Lina in his heart!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pulled Lina to his car and suddenly let go of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina slumped almost unsteadily into the passenger seat. Before she knew it, Hadwin Stephenson was already in the driver's seat and had started the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car sped in the direction of Lina's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Fasten your seat belt," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was still in a daze. She subconsciously listened to what he said and fastened her seat belt. She could not help looking at Hadwin Stephenson, who was driving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His face... seemed paler than before, and there seemed to be a thin layer of sweat on his forehead. He frowned slightly as if he was feeling uncomfortable. It was as if he was suppressing something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the car stopped at the intersection as it was a red light, Lina could not help asking, "Are you okay? Are you sick? You&rsquo;re sweating on your forehead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She drew a tissue that was nearby and unconsciously raised her hand to wipe off the sweat on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before her hand could touch his forehead, he said sharply, "Don't touch me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's hand instantly froze in mid-air. She seemed to have sobered up a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, feeling a little embarrassed, she said, "Okay, got it. I won't touch you. You can wipe your sweat off yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, she put down the tissue and withdrew her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does he even resent me for touching him now? Then why did he pull me into his car?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a depressive air inside the car.</p></div>
