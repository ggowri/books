        <h1>Chapter 2826</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and Brian lay in the same bed that night, but Brian did not do anything to her. He only lay beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did... uh... touch him a little bit, especially his shapely abs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she did that unconsciously after she fell asleep. When she woke up in the morning, her hand was still in his bathrobe, pressed against his abs!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of what had happened when she woke up this morning, Valda Theller had the impulse to kill herself. He must think she was a pervert now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian drove back to tMason Swansonty in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to return to your apartment or studio?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh... My apartment," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright," he replied and drove toward her apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car fell silent again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long pause, his voice suddenly rang out. "What's the matter? Are you embarrassed to talk to me now because you love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Cough... Cough..." She choked. Well, he was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced at her flushed face out of the corners of his eyes. "You seem to blush easily. Are you going to keep blushing and saying nothing like this for the rest of our relationship?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No." She hesitated slightly before suddenly saying, "I'm sorry I stuck my hand in your bathrobe this morning... I didn't mean to. I didn't know I would do that after falling asleep..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stammered to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled. "Remember what I said yesterday? Yesterday, you said you wanted to force yourself on me and touch me. I said I didn't mind you having such ideas. I don't mind you doing that either. Speaking of which, you left out one step. You didn't force yourself on me, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Cough... Cough..." Valda Theller choked herself again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he say that to encourage me to force myself on him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, we're a couple. You have nothing to be ashamed of, but I hope you won't avoid me. Don't be silent because you're embarrassed. It&rsquo;ll make me feel like I did something wrong," Brian said slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though her blushing and awkwardness were adorable, he liked to hear her talk. He liked her chattering and how she got along with him naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller bit her lip slightly before nodding heavily and saying, "Yeah, okay. L-Let's behave as usual."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the atmosphere in the car relaxed, and Valda Theller started chatting with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She realized how quickly time flew when the car reached her apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I'm getting out now," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a slight smile on Brian's lip. Perhaps even he did not realize that he was smiling more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at his smile blankly and impulsively went over to kiss him on his lips. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she gasped slightly as she asked nervously, "I... I'm your girlfriend, so it's okay for me to do this, right?"</p></div>
