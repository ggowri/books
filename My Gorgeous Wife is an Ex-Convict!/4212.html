        <h1>Chapter 4210</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Chandler stayed in Tina's ward, quietly watching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he wanted to imprint the image of her that he hadn't seen in the past six months into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, what happened to you? Since you met Kit, why didn't you come to find me?" Chandler asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the person on the hospital bed didn't answer him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he already knew the answer, he probably had to find it from Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened between Kit and Tina after they met? And how did Kit find Tina?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this could only be answered by Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler didn't sleep a wink that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Kit, too, didn't sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Kit was lying in the ward and couldn't move freely due to his injuries, he could at least estimate the time. Starting from when he called Chandler, if Chandler set off immediately, he should be here by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler should have seen Tina!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two people who should have been together finally met!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the liar also received punishment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the day finally dawned, Kit had a feeling that he was about to </span><span>be punished.</span></p></div>
