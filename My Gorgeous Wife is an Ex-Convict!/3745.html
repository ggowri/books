        <h1>Chapter 3743</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica pursed her lips tightly. Love? This word... seemed a bit too heavy. But if she didn't love him, why did she always think of Mason over the years? Why did she regret her misunderstanding of him in the past? Even now, why did she take the initiative to kiss him and hope to date him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think, yes, I love him! I just couldn't see my own feelings before," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when she finally understood, it was a bit late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, it's not too late, because now she's already "trying to date" Mason. Even if he has forgotten the past feelings, she will try her best to make him fall in love with her again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't see clearly?" Daniel suddenly sneered, "When did you not see your own feelings clearly? When we were together, did you already not see your own feelings clearly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned pale, "I'm sorry, but... when I was with you, I was sincere. At that time, I really only saw Mason as a younger brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he's not your brother," Daniel said, "Do you really think you and Mason will have a future? After we broke up, he went abroad for so many years, while you still had to work hard to support yourself. If he really cared about you, shouldn't he have solved these problems for you? He's very rich, isn't he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is very rich, and he can easily solve these problems for me, but I don't want to rely on others. Isn't it better to work hard and get these things myself?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a mocking look on Daniel's face, "The so-called self-reliance is just </span><span>because you don't dare to expect others to be your reliance for your whole life, and you're afraid that there will be a day when you will separate, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was stunned, looking at him somewhat dazedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're afraid that one day Mason will leave you, and you won't be able to handle the blow, so you don't want to be a parasite?" Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's eyelashes trembled slightly. Yes, parasite, a kind of parasitic plant. "The word 'parasite' is still somewhat poetic. If it sounds harsher, it can be called a leech."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Barlow family had always been leeches, relying on the Reed family to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to be a leech, I don't want to rely on others. It's not because I think we will definitely separate. Why can't I rely on myself? I also hope that one day, I can be someone else's reliance. If it's hard and difficult now, and I want to get comfort without working hard, how can I become someone else's reliance in the future?" Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was not loud, but it made Daniel feel so strong and powerful, as if something had exploded in his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really leaving now, goodbye." Veronica finished speaking and hurriedly left the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel stood there dumbfounded for a while before saying, "Veronica, you and Mason can't have a future. That guy is just a dark manipulator who uses money to do whatever he wants. He doesn't understand what love is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he would be there in the end, witnessing the outcome of their relationship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica left the company and called Mason. Her conversation with Daniel had taken longer than expected, and she was now running late for their meeting. She wasn't sure if Mason would still be waiting for her at the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Mason answered the phone, Veronica quickly apologized for being late and asked if he was still at the restaurant and if he could wait for her for half an hour. Mason agreed without any apparent displeasure in his voice, which relieved Veronica.</span></p></div>
