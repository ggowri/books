        <h1>Chapter 1277</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't lie?" He sneered. "If you didn't lie, does that mean you still have me in your heart? Do you still love me? You never got over me, have you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she replied. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sarcasm at the corners of his lips grew thicker. "Then why don't you prove to me that you have me in your heart, that you love me, and that you never got over me? What do you think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the man in front of her. What Brian said after taking her to the mansion made her realize she had always been in love with the man in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after Brian talked about missing and never missing, she figured she would still fall in love with Jason regardless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she felt for Brian was limited to their childhood friendship and gratitude for saving her life. She was also touched, but... it was not love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was willing to swear to stay with Jay for the rest of her life. It was not just for the children but probably for herself too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did not love him, then maybe she would not have any expectations for her future marriage and would not have firmly said that she had never fallen for Brian when he asked her those &lsquo;what ifs&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What woman would not fall for a man like Brian who would even give his life to save theirs?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only reason she did not fall for him was that another man had already occupied her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her hand and gently held Jason's face. The look in her eyes seemed like she had made up her mind. Her head slightly closed in the space between them, and she pressed her lips on his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was different from the kiss they had performed in front of Brian. This kiss was more lingering and gentle. It was as if she wanted to smooth his anger with the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He trembled with shock on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She closed her eyes while her hands gradually wrapped around his neck, drawing the distance between them closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss went on for so long that he fell into a trance. He only felt a sense of loss when her lips left his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if... it was not enough. It was as if... he wanted her to kiss him longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I do want you." Her voice rang gently in his ears. "You once said I shouldn't touch you if I'm not attracted to you. So now that I've touched you, it means I'm attracted to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her, and his voice seemed to squeeze through his throat. "Do you... really want me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have I not made it obvious by now?" she asked. 'If I weren&rsquo;t pregnant right now, um... I guess I could make it a little more obvious.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together. Then, he closed his eyes as if he was thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was moments later when he opened his eyes again. His gaze was like a net that caught her. Then, his lips immediately fell upon hers. He kissed her hard as his hoarse voice escaped from his lips. "Grace, don't lie to me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn called Grace at night and asked her how she was doing. After all, she had been feeling a little worried since Grace was taken away by Brian during the day.</p></div>
