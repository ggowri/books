        <h1>Chapter 1257</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian lowered his eyes and stared at his right hand, which... had held that bloody knee back then. His fingertips had also been stained with her blood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That was... the blood she had shed for me...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had fallen in love with her, but why did he miss her again and again? He even missed her last cry for help from him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If... I hadn't mistaken her for someone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And... if I hadn&rsquo;t been blinded by jealousy...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Stella hadn't taken Grace's place, I would've investigated more and verified things more carefully. Then everything might have been different! What a fool I was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I at least had the heart to check the information carefully, I wouldn't have missed out on Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Brian felt nothing but a piercing pain that almost left him breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to the firm the next day. She had not been back at the firm for several days now. Although she had asked for leave with Lawyer Carter, it was inappropriate to keep asking for leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she was now pregnant with triplets. She might not be able to complete a lot of work that followed. One usually could not carry triplets to full term, and they would be delivered early through C-section. Therefore, the remaining time she could work in the firm till her pregnancy was limited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace told Lawyer Carter about her pregnancy as soon as she returned to the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're pregnant?" Lawyer Carter was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yes, triplets. They're three months along now. I'll try my best to finish the work on hand now, but I'm afraid it'll be difficult for me to finish some of the newer work. You'll need to hire a new assistant. I'm so sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt very sorry. After all, she had only been working in the firm for a short time, but now she was suddenly pregnant and unable to complete many tasks. Lawyer Carter would have to hire a new assistant because of this, which would also trouble him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter only laughed and said, "Congratulations, you're the first person around me to have triplets! It'll be tough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I'm mentally prepared for that," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you plan to come back to the firm after delivering the babies? If you're willing to come back, I'll keep your position on hold," said Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at him gratefully at that. Lawyer Carter had been willing to give her a chance when she was having trouble finding a job, and now, he was even willing to keep her position on hold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, but it&rsquo;s alright. After all, I still have a lot of things to take care of after delivering the babies. I'm afraid it'll be a long time before I can go back to work, even if I want to," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay then. You can contact me if you ever want to re-engage in legal work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you..." Grace felt a sudden surge of nausea as she spoke. She quickly covered her mouth, made an apologetic gesture, and hurried off to the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Blaargh... Blaargh..." She vomited in the toilet for a long time before she was finally done, but her stomach felt somewhat empty.</p></div>
