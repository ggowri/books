        <h1>Chapter 1285</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He loved her, but he's going to marry another woman soon. Besides, he's the one who sent the woman he loved to jail. Even if he regrets it one day, Kyla may not forgive him. Kyla's whole life is ruined. So what if he regrets it later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found it unfair for Kyla Corbyn. She had fallen in love with a man who sent her to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Martin Weiss even had the cheek to fight her for Nelson&rsquo;s custody!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stiffened. "Do you think Kyla Corbyn won't forgive Martin Weiss even if he regrets what he&rsquo;s done and begs Kyla Corbyn for forgiveness one day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pondered about it and said, "I don't know. I'm not Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... what if it were you?" Jason asked hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "If it were me, I probably won't forgive him. Some mistakes can be forgiven, but some mistakes can't. Or rather, sometimes the so-called forgiveness is when the person no longer triggers your emotions. It's like they're strangers and can no longer affect you at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason only felt like there was something stuck in his chest, and his heart seemed to be immersed in ice water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's leave too," said Grace. It was only after she had taken two steps that she realized the person next to her was not following her. Therefore, she puzzledly turned to look at Jason who was still standing there. "Jay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to have just come back to his senses. A faint smile appeared on the corners of his lips. "Sure, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not speak much on their way back. Even though Grace brought up a few topics, Jason only answered with a few words and said nothing else afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car arrived at Reed Residence's gates, but two figures suddenly rushed over from the side. Before they could reach the car, they were stopped by the security guards at Reed Residence's gates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two yelled as they struggled to free themselves from the security guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was instantly stunned when she saw the two people. They were... her biological father, Tony Cummins, and her stepmother, Melinda Riley. Speaking of which, she had not seen them since they sold their house and left Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll get someone to drive them away," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll get out of the car and see what they're up to," said Grace after giving it some thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll go with you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got out of the car. Tony Cummins looked at his eldest daughter who was standing beside Jason. He regretted being so blind before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was having a hard time finding out where Grace was working, her colleagues had told him that his eldest daughter had married Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Emerald City's Master Reed! He was someone who could almost rule Emerald City. He was so much better than Sean!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had not fallen out with his eldest daughter, he would be living a good life right now. He would have everything he wanted. He could be living the good life because of his daughter instead of being so down and out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I... I heard you married Master Reed. Well... Why didn't you tell us you were married?" Tony Cummins put on a fatherly attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I thought my family had disowned me? Didn't you even sell your house when you left Emerald City? Do I still have a home?"</p></div>
