        <h1>Chapter 2080</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The distance between them was so close yet so far. It seemed as if he could not get close even if he did everything he could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What would it take for you to give me a little affection? I... only want a little bit..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She rejected him ruthlessly, saying, "There's nothing you can do, Martin Weiss. I told you, it's over between us. Let's act as if yesterday never happened. I hope you'll forget about it, and I'll forget about it too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes were full of pain. 'How can I forget?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss seemed to have lost his strength suddenly as he staggered back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla took a deep breath. "I hope you won't ever come to my store again. You can call me about anything regarding Nelson. This is the end of us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Kyla turned to leave, leaving Martin Weiss standing alone in the room. His mood was now different from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he heard the door close, Martin Weiss fell to his knees in dejection. His hands clenched together as he pounded the floor hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah... Ah... Ah!" Roars of pain escaped his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla returned to the store, and Mrs. Corbyn asked nervously when she saw her daughter return, "How did it go? Why did he come to see you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla reassured her mother. "It's nothing. But I made it clear that he should never come to the store again. It's impossible between us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn hesitated and said, "He... never got married or had any other woman after all these years. Perhaps he really&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom!" Kyla interrupted. She knew what her mother was trying to say. "If I get together with him, I&rsquo;ll just be reminded of the past every time I see him. I&rsquo;ll never be able to get over it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Everything was calm in the following days. Martin Weiss never came to her again, and Chase's ex-wife did not harass her again either. According to Chase, his ex-wife was aggressive in getting his shop, but she suddenly gave up and did not come looking for him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The store's business was relatively slow during weekends. Grace treated Kyla and Lina to a meal. It was an opportunity for the three women to get together too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was now eight months along in her pregnancy. She looked happy. They could tell Hadwin Stephenson had been feeding her plenty when they saw her round face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you 33 weeks along now?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, you're gonna be their godmother once they're born!" Lina said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you know whether you're getting a boy or a girl?" added Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina shook her head, "Hadwin and I think it's better to find out the gender when they're born. Consider it a surprise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at Lina's bulging pregnant belly and said emotionally, "Time does fly. In the blink of an eye, it&rsquo;s almost time for you to deliver your child.&rdquo;</p></div>
