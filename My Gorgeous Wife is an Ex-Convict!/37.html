        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if Lily really thought she was indeed better than everyone else, she was unable to say it out loud as the crowd gathered around her had gotten bigger.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily grew even angrier, especially when she saw that some of the gathered people had taken out their phones to record them. And yet, on the surface, she still had to maintain her composure.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was not long before more Sanitation Service Center workers, along with people sent by the police, arrived to help look for the ring.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was freezing cold and she and Annabelle were surrounded by onlookers as they were interrogated by the police, all while standing next to piles of garbage and breathing in waves of noxious fumes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Needless to say, the ring was ultimately not found. When the police finally allowed Lily and Annabelle to leave, the two of them were close to vomiting from the stench.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lily, what do we do? This incident has been blown way out of proportion. They&rsquo;re deeming it a criminal case," Annabelle said nervously when they were back in the car. She didn&rsquo;t mind the occasional prank or joke, but having the police involved was never a good thing. &rdquo;Who on earth reported the case? Even the police came."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'll handle it. It&rsquo;s not like the case can be resolved," Lily said, her face grim.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily was less worried about the criminal case and more concerned about her self-image. She was a celebrity who was often photographed in high-class venues and she&rsquo;d spent the last hours beside piles of garbage. Between the fans, workers, and police, there were plenty of people at the scene recording her and she was afraid it would turn into a trending topic. That was all she needed Ugh! She hurriedly called her agent and publicist to suppress all related news.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's body was engulfed in the stench of the garbage. Although she&rsquo;d worn gloves and had washed her hands multiple times, a faint odor still lingered on them. As for her body, even after changing out of her uniform into her day clothes and jacket, the smell still clung to her skin. "These rich people are too much. They just lose a ring and suddenly, we&rsquo;re the ones tortured for it!? If it's such an expensive ring, why didn't they look after it more closely themselves?" Claire grumbled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace gave her a few words of comfort, then took her bag and left.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Lily&rsquo;s farce, she went back home later than usual. The street lamps had already been lit. The Cold wind blew at her face and pricked her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today, she once again sensed the difference between her past and her present.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Lily had asked for the ring to be searched for, she had not even an ounce of strength with which to fight back.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because she needed this terrible job. No one else would hire her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her past self could have given up on this kind of job and still have found plenty of other opportunities, but it was extremely hard for her present self to find even this one posting.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she wanted to survive, stay warm, and eat well, she could only continue on.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, she stopped in her tracks and stared dazedly at the nearby figure standing by the gate of the apartment complex.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He waited for her to come back!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The light from the street lamp shone on him and his handsome face was the balm she needed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">My present self is different from my past self, at least. I'm no longer alone.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay." Grace quickly ran toward him but right before she reached him she hurriedly halted her footsteps.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He lifted his pretty eyes to stare at her confusedly. "Sister?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I... There's a strong stench on me now, so don't come too close to me," she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a hell of a day,&rdquo; she said and managed to laugh about it now. &ldquo;I stink. Let&rsquo;s go in. It's cold out here."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she spoke, she started toward the building, thinking if she got there quickly enough, she could jump into the shower and wash her clothes before she stunk up the room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But a pair of arms looped around her from behind and in the next moment, she was pulled into a tight embrace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay!" she cried out faintly.</p></div>
