        <h1>Chapter 3188</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he thought of that possibility, his disgust towards Lexi increased a bit more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you, if I ever run into trouble, I'll call you first," Valda smiled and said, "So you can trust me, I won't be stupid enough to get into trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her smile and couldn't help but curve his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her smile always seemed to easily infect him, and his mood would improve with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, come on, let's eat. The wontons today are pretty good," she said, spooning up a wonton and taking a bite to show how delicious it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes darkened, "Okay, I'll try it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But instead of reaching for a spoon, he held her face and, to her surprise, leaned in and kissed her lips, tasting the flavor of the wonton in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes widened suddenly, her face turning as red as a cloud at sunset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Goodness, who tastes food like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing their meal, Brian and Valda left the private room and went to the parking lot to retrieve their car. There, they ran into the Lambert family, who were hurrying over with Lexi by their side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert family rushed up to Brian as soon as they saw him and said, "Brian, our daughter Lexi was wrong to disrespect Miss Theller today. However, Lexi is still your cousin, and you almost broke her hand today. Let's just let this matter go. I...I will make sure she apologizes to Miss Theller!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need to apologize," Brian refused outright, "If she keeps trying to insult Valda over and over again, then there's no need for this kind of apology."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"On Lexi's side..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But in the future, don't tell anyone that she's my cousin or anything like that. If I hear you say it, don't blame me for not showing mercy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he said this, the Lambert couple's faces immediately turned extremely ugly, and Lexi's face was even paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that's the case, it means that the Hart family will no longer provide her with any assistance in the future. She won't even be able to benefit from the Hart family's reputation. How will she continue to thrive in the entertainment industry?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cousin's words shattered her dream of becoming a big star in the entertainment industry and making a lot of money. It can even be said that he destroyed her promising career prospects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, it must have been you who added fuel to the fire and said something, that's why Brian said such things to me!" Lexi said angrily to Valda, then turned to Brian with a pitiful expression and said, "Brian, I don't know how much bad things Valda said about me to you, but it's not true. I didn't say much about her, but she said I slandered her and even threatened to send me to jail."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda shrugged and replied, "I didn't say anything that wasn't true. You've been spreading rumors about me and I had to defend myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi retorted, "I never spread any rumors about you! You're just trying to make me look bad in front of Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian interrupted, "Okay, okay, let's calm down. Lexi, Valda, I don't want to hear any more accusations. Let's just focus on finding a solution to this problem."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Lexi directly turned the tables.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's gaze became increasingly cold as he spoke, "The things you said today are enough for me to have you arrested. Or I could call your classmates over right now and ask them what they heard!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi was taken aback, "Brian, do you really believe Valda's words like that? I'm your cousin, we've known each other for so many years, don't you believe me at all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with, why wouldn't I believe her over you?" Brian coldly retorted, "So don't challenge my bottom line again, otherwise the next time we meet might be in court!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, Brian took Valda's hand and got into the car, leaving the Lambert family of three standing there, looking at each other in confusion.</p></div>
