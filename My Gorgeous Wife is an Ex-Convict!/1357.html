        <h1>Chapter 1356</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn went to the hotel where Martin Weiss was staying and asked the hotel receptionist, "May I ask if Mr. Martin Weiss is in the hotel now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss has gone out and isn&rsquo;t back yet. If you want to look for Mr. Weiss, you can contact him or wait in the hotel lobby," they replied politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn pressed her lips together. It seemed she had no other option but to wait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for contacting Martin Weiss... She had long lost Martin Weiss's contact information. The only one she could contact was Martin Weiss's lawyer, who was in charge of the custody case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn sat in the lobby and waited without saying a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Time passed quietly until it was dark outside. Finally, she saw Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels walking into the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss saw Kyla Corbyn as soon as he walked into the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were many people in the hotel lobby, but it seemed that his eyes could always easily spot her in the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here?" asked Martin Weiss as he looked at Kyla Corbyn who had come up to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's something I want to talk to you about," said Kyla Corbyn as she pressed her somewhat dry lips together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Talk to me about?" He sneered, "Didn't you tell me not to disturb you for three months, Kyla Corbyn? Now you want to see me? Don't you find it funny?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words felt like a slap in her face, making her feel embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels laughed and said, "Kyla Corbyn, what do you want to see Martin for? Were you just playing hard to get when you said you were giving up custody? Martin won't fall for that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Paisley Daniels spoke, she took Martin Weiss's arm in an exceedingly intimate fashion and said, "Martin, let's go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," said Martin Weiss, moving his feet to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn suddenly reached out her hand and stopped Martin Weiss. "Can we talk in private? I only want a few minutes of your time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said coldly, "I don't think I have anything to talk about with you. Since you said three months, then I hope you won't bother me during the stipulated time as well. Besides, don't play hard to get with me. I'm not interested!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn trembled. The hand she held in front of Martin Weiss was ruthlessly pushed away by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels's figures as they walked toward the elevator, Kyla Corbyn's eyes dimmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Still... no? I didn't even get a chance to speak!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I destined to let Nelson down? But... I don't have much time left. I only have six months, and I might get so weak that I&rsquo;ll only be able to lie in bed in the last three months.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to fulfill her son's dream in her remaining days and leave him a beautiful memory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn suddenly clenched her teeth and rushed over just as Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels were about to get into the elevator. She grabbed Martin Weiss directly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" she said. Her fingers holding his arm were so tightly clenched that even her body was trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels had now stepped into the elevator. Seeing this, she immediately said crossly in the elevator, "Kyla Corbyn, what are you doing? Martin, don't bother with such women!"</p></div>
