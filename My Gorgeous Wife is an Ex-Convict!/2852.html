        <h1>Chapter 2850</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller asked rhetorically, "So, are you smug because you look similar to Grace? It's not surprising that two people look similar, but you're even trying to copy her hairstyle and fashion sense. Are you trying to imitate her and become her substitute? Do you think Brian would love a substitute?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if I'm a substitute? I love Brian, and I don't mind being a substitute for him!" Whitney Cooper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ll never want to be a substitute when I love someone. If you're a substitute, what's so great about getting temporary affection? You're only taking advantage! You're nothing when the real deal appears," Valda Theller said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper's expression became ghastly. She had wanted to embarrass Valda Theller, but now it seemed like she was the embarrassed one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you know? Brian loves Grace so much that he&rsquo;ll never fall in love with anyone else! Do you know how hard Brian cried and hugged me when he woke up in the middle of the night when we were abroad? Do you know how he begged me not to leave him&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough! Whitney Cooper, since when did you have the right to meddle in my affairs?" A shout interrupted Whitney Cooper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper and Valda Theller turned around to see Brian standing at the studio&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper froze. "Brian, what are you doing here?" Today was a work day. She came here early to avoid him and meet Valda Theller alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said coldly, "Why wouldn't I be here? And what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I just... learned online that Miss Theller is your girlfriend. I came here to have a look because I was curious." Whitney Cooper tried hard to make her expression look more like Grace's. "Brian, you won't blame me, will you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why wouldn't I blame you? What nonsense did you tell her?" His dark phoenix eyes were cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper bit her lip, looking pitiful. "Brian, I... I just told Miss Theller that I like you very much. I'm willing to do anything as long as I can stay with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she timidly went over to pull the hem of Brian's shirt. "Brian, I missed you so much when I was abroad. That's why I came here to look for you. I want to stay by your side as your secretary, can I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes flickered with confusion. Whitney Cooper already looked similar to Grace to begin with, and she looked even more like Grace with her hair, outfit, and makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if Grace was saying these words in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought of the woman he loved made his heart ache again. If only Grace wanted to stay by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian..." Whitney Cooper called out softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The confusion in Brian's eyes thickened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a pair of arms grabbed his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Brian is my boyfriend! If you&rsquo;re only Brian's secretary, Miss Cooper, I hope you&rsquo;ll keep your distance. Even if you like him, you should know he has a girlfriend now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice woke him up. He looked blankly at Valda Theller standing next to him with half of her body almost attached to his arm.</p></div>
