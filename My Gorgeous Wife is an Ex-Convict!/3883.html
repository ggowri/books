        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the doctor performing the examination was startled by her tears and quickly handed her a tissue, "Why are you crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm so happy to hear that there's a fetal bud and heartbeat," Veronica said. This step can be considered a milestone in pregnancy, as some natural miscarriages occur at this stage, resulting in the loss of the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, the fetal bud and heartbeat of the baby are good now. It must be a healthy baby," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica came out of the ultrasound room, Mason rushed up to her and asked, "What's wrong? Is there any problem with the test results?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," she shook her head and cried tears of joy again. "The baby is very healthy, with a fetal bud and heartbeat!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why are you crying?" he said, wiping away the tears from her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"These are tears of joy," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But even if they are tears of joy, I don't want you to cry," Mason whispered. "When I see your tears, I always feel a little sad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica sniffled and tried to stop her tears, while Mason took a tissue and carefully wiped away the tears from her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's go to your house," Veronica said proactively. "Tell them that we have a baby and we're getting married!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay!" Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, the Reed family gathered around the dining table, ready to eat. Before dinner, Jasper couldn't help but ask, "Mason, did you ask us all to come home for dinner tonight because there's something you want to tell us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, there is something I want to say," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not that you're going to get engaged to Veronica, is it?" Jasper said. She only said this casually and didn't take it seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Mason really wanted to get engaged to Veronica, it would be after they graduated from college.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, Mason's words made the whole family look shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not engaged, but married. I'm going to marry Veronica in two months!" said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Married?" Jasper's voice was clearly off-key.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick looked puzzled. "Why the rush?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason and Grace were the quickest to recover from their shock. They looked at each other as if they had guessed something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica is pregnant, so I want to get married as soon as possible," Mason seemed determined to shock them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper widened his eyes and looked at Mason in disbelief. "Mason, are you serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I'm joking?" Mason asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper closed his mouth and felt that he needed time to sort out his feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pregnant? Veronica is pregnant?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does that mean I'm going to be an aunt?" 11-year-old Jasmine asked innocently. Although she is now 150cm tall, her face still has a childish look, with chubby cheeks that make her look very cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...yes, you're going to be an aunt," Jasper replied nervously. And she was going to be an aunt, and her parents...were going to be grandparents, which seemed a bit early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But thinking about the new member of the family who was about to be born, Jasper was filled with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about the cute little baby, she couldn't wait for it to be born so she could hold it!</p></div>
