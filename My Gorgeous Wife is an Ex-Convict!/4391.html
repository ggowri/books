        <h1>Chapter 4389 Poor Uncle</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's face couldn't help but turned red. Although ever since he became famous, many people had praised his looks, he had gradually gone from feeling shy and awkward to not feeling anything at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the other party's compliments were ever so flattering, he wouldn't feel a ripple in his heart upon hearing them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, hearing these words from her, his heart suddenly raced, and blood rushed to his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert didn't need to look in the mirror to know that his face was probably very red by now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two arrived at the entrance of the kindergarten, they saw the teacher leading a line of little darlings out from inside. Meanwhile, the parents waiting at the entrance were picking up their children in an orderly manner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, whether they were corporate executives, CEOs, or celebrities, they all had to patiently line up to pick up their kids.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was in line behind Harley. Despite wearing a hat and mask, he still felt a bit uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had indeed become quite famous in the previous two years, and it was easy for people to recognize him, which could cause a bit of a stir.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he never saw any benefit in causing a commotion or attracting attention from others. His only fear was that if he was recognized, it might cause trouble for Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So back then, he was keeping his head as low as possible!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it was finally Harley's turn in line, he looked at the adorable Quinn, cheerfully raising his hand in greeting, "Hey, Quinn, it's my turn to pick you up today!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Harley!" Quinn excitedly ran up and hugged Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't seen Aunt Harley in such a long time, and she absolutely loved listening to Aunt Harley's stories. Because the stories Aunt Harley told were all her own creations, they were way more interesting than any storybook she'd ever read!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So today, she told her mom that she really wanted to see Aunt Harley, and she wanted Aunt Harley to pick her up from school.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe Aunt Harley had </span><span>actually shown</span><span> up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who was the person next to Aunt Harley?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's eyes widened, curiously looking at Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert felt a bit embarrassed under Quinn's gaze and said to Harley, "Let's head to the car first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Quinn's eyes widened suddenly as if he had thought of something, and he exclaimed, "It's the handsome pitiful uncle!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." Calvert stumbled, almost slipping because of this nickname. His face turned beet red. Even though he was wearing a mask, you could still tell he was very nervous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Quinn, this is a secret!" Harley signaled to Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn blinked, nodding smartly, then clamped her mouth shut tight as if terrified someone might discover this secret.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they got back in the car, Quinn curiously asked Harley, "Is he really the handsome, pitiful uncle?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was a bit exasperated, "He's Uncle Calvert, you can't call him 'pretty little pitiful uncle'."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Uncle is really handsome!" Quinn said earnestly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed! Harley strongly agrees with this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And poor Uncle, he's always crying, just can't stop!" Quinn added.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was embarrassed and could only explain to Calvert, "It's because she's seen the first TV show you acted in, she really liked that character."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert instantly understood what Harley was talking about.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that drama, he played the role of a supporting male character who was in love but couldn't have the woman he desired. He silently protected the female lead, never daring to confess his feelings. Every time he missed her or felt heartache for her, tears would fall from his eyes.</span></p></div>
