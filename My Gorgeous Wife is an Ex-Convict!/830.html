        <h1>Chapter 829</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, got it," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's going to be submitted tomorrow, so make sure you get it signed today." Lawyer Carter urged before giving Grace the contact details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Grace called, it was their secretary who answered. They just told Grace that the client would be at Magnificence for a party that night. If she wanted to get the documents signed, she could go to Magnificence. They even gave her the number of the banquet room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Magnificence was a famous nightclub in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Grace arrived, she found many men and women gathered at the banquet room. They seemed to be having a party. For a moment, Grace was confused about who she was looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had to call the secretary one more time before finding the client near the pool table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the son of a rich family with a pretty bad reputation. He was getting sued for being violent during his relationship with a girl who asked for compensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter took the case to defend him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had read the case files, and it was almost clear that the man had indeed violently assaulted the woman. Grace disliked such a man, but it was work after all&mdash;unless she quit now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Yu, please sign this document. It has to be officially submitted tomorrow," Grace said to Curtis Row who was playing pool with a beautiful woman in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row just glanced at her lazily and asked, "Can't you see I'm busy? Just wait till Jiao Jiao and I are finished. Then I'll sign it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jiao Jiao, who was in his arms, giggled. They then brought their bodies closer together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips together and kept quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One would always get bullied at work, and she had no means to escape it now. At least it was better than what she had experienced in prison. She just had to stand and wait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace just stood aside quietly while Curtis Row was having fun with the beautiful woman in his arms. Even if he finished one round, he would immediately start another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace reminded him that it was only a signature, but Curtis Row just left her on the sidelines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know how long she had been standing there for. It could very well have been an hour. As she had been standing like this for a long time, coupled with the air conditioning on full blast, her knees began to ache faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since her imprisonment, she had developed rheumatism. The bones in her fingers and knees were where the pain was most likely to occur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back when she lived in Reed Residence, she regularly took her medicine and was getting much better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after breaking up with Jason, she no longer went to the hospital to see a doctor nor did she take any medication.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was more than her income could afford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Just endure it. It'll be over soon,' Grace said to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was suddenly a commotion at the entrance. Curtis Row, who was playing pool with the beautiful woman, stopped and said to Jiao Jiao, "Come on. Let's meet the crown prince of the entertainment industry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jiao Jiao was excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately shuddered when she heard this. The crown prince of the entertainment industry&hellip; There was probably only one person in Emerald City with that title.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian!</p></div>
