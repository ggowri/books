        <h1>Chapter 825</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a thought." She shrugged. "As an architectural designer, I have to dream a little."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's true." He smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin joined the bidding on the popular plot Lina mentioned when the auction began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"President Stephenson." His assistant was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the plot was not part of their plan. It was so popular that the competition was intense, so the final price might not be pretty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they won the auction, they would probably earn a reputation rather than a profit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Hadwin said, "Bid for it and use this land to make a name for the Stephenson Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant stopped speaking, but his eyes could not help but wander to the woman who was drinking juice while surfing the internet on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'President Stephenson isn&rsquo;t going to bid for that plot just because of what the woman said, is he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it possible? Spending billions of dollars just because of what she said?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was crazy just thinking about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily sat in the private room and looked at the numbers jumping on the screen in front of her. 'Stephenson Group... is also bidding for that popular plot.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Earlier, she had clearly said that Stephenson Group was not interested in the land and other companies participating in the auction did not have what it took to get the land, so she was pretty confident she could get it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now... Stephenson Group was going to compete with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily gritted her teeth. Her gorgeous face was now contorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be because of the woman named Qin? Is that why Hadwin has decided to continue standing up for that woman and compete with the Atkinson family for the plot?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that not only Grace, but even her friend, a woman who had always been a nobody in her eyes, was now her obstacle!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sooner or later, I'll make them regret it! I'll make them see that I, Lily, am not someone they can pick on easily!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt relieved when the auction was over!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even laughed out loud when the Atkinson family lost their bid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On their way out, Lina once again bumped into Lily who was about to leave. She unceremoniously gave Lily a sarcastic look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director and her colleagues had already left, but Lina received a lot of text messages from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They all said that they did not help her out because it happened so quickly that they were stupefied. As such, they hoped she would not mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at these text messages, Lina pursed her lips and did not reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't feel comfortable in your current design firm, just go somewhere else," Hadwin said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina knew that Hadwin had figured out that she was unhappy because the director and her colleagues stayed quiet to keep themselves safe earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not that easy to get a new job!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How hard is it? I'll help you find a suitable place later," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. 'Oh, I forgot. These things are pretty easy for him.'</p></div>
