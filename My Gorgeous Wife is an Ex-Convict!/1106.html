        <h1>Chapter 1105</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In fact... it's not that you can't love me anymore. It's just that you're afraid I'll hurt you again, right?" Jason asked softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a feeling that he had seen through her. Perhaps it was like what he said. She was afraid. She was so afraid that she dared not love again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I won't hurt you again!" Jason restrained the charm in his eyes, leaving only seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slowly rising to his feet, he walked over to her while his eyes stared at her almond-shaped eyes. "You don't believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "Nobody can guarantee this sort of thing." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll make a vow if you still don't believe me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no need to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could speak, he lowered himself and knelt on one knee in front of her. His face was solemn, grave, and showed commitment. "I, Jason, swear that if I ever hurt you in the future, I'll make it up to you by tenfold. If I make you cry, then the pain will hurt my bones and burn my heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were full of shock. She never expected him to kneel in front of her like this, not to mention saying such things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked down at him blankly. He lowered his eyes, looked down, and murmured, "You know what? I heard that in some tribes with ancient customs, if one kisses the instep of another, then it's a sign of submission. It means you're willing to give them your loyalty and soul."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes widened, and his voice sounded far away yet close to her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is he talking about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is he going to do?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart was pounding uncontrollably. Then, she saw him gently removing the slipper from her right foot, almost in an alarming manner, before placing his lips to her instep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I love you, so I can give you everything I have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice, like the crooning of a cello, rang in her ears with determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mind went blank!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never expected Jason to do such a thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When had a proud man like him done such a thing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was because of this she... was extremely at a loss. He seemed to disrupt her calmness and persistence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It might not be hard to fall in love with him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he was attractive to women, and who could insist on not loving a man who would love a woman with all their heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All this time, she could only remind herself to forget how it felt to love him, to let go of the broken relationship and not love him. Then there would be no more pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was going to happen between her and Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked to the edge of the lotus pond. Grace was still worried as she looked at the lotus flowers in the pond. Just then, there were footsteps behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Jason here?' She thought to herself. The feeling of not knowing what to do came back. It was as if she did not know how to face him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she heard the person behind her calling her name, she was stunned. She quickly turned around and looked at the person behind her in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not Jason, it was... Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was dressed in a black shirt and trousers, quickly walking over to her.</p></div>
