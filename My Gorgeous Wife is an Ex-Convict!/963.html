        <h1>Chapter 962</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little relieved. If Mrs. Corbyn had gone out for groceries, she should not be too far away from home and would probably be back soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace asked more about the situation and said, "Nelson, listen here. Help your mother loosen her collar and put a pillow under her feet to raise it a little. I'll call the ambulance now. If your grandma comes back later, tell her what happened, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, got it," answered Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then called the emergency services and gave them Kyla's current address after explaining what happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">15 minutes later, Mrs. Corbyn called, saying that the ambulance had arrived. The paramedic checked and said that Kyla&rsquo;s condition should not be too serious, but just in case, they were sending her to the hospital for a check-up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was finally a little relieved. After asking which hospital the ambulance was going to, she hurried to the hospital after work and saw Kyla on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a week of not seeing her, Kyla, who was in a hospital gown, was much thinner than the last time Grace saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hospital gown looked a little too big on her. Her pale face looked a little haggard, and even her lips did not have much color.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, thank you for calling the emergency services today," said Kyla. She forgot to teach her son some general knowledge, causing him to panic when faced with such a sudden situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you pass out suddenly? What did the doctor say?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The doctor said it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s malnourished and has been sleeping poorly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. After all, people rarely fainted from malnutrition these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't have much of an appetite lately, so I've been eating less, and sometimes I can't sleep, so this happened." Kyla gave a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because of Martin Weiss?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla glanced over to Nelson who was already asleep in the bedside chair. Her son was a little shaken when she fainted, and it was not until she woke up that he finally fell asleep as he could finally be relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla thought of her son's red eyes when she awoke, she felt a pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not hide it from Grace. "Yeah. A few days ago, Martin Weiss explicitly told me that he would fight for Nelson's custody before he left Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to that, she had been feeling dispirited these days. She could not eat much, and she often suffered from insomnia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there no room to change all this?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head with a wry smile. "He's a man who's true to his words." There was no leeway at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not to mention when it came to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps her existence was a sin to him! How could such a man give her any leeway?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he does fight for custody, then we'll fight him for it. Kyla, if you don't have any lawyers in mind, then I'll handle this case for you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that with Kyla's current situation, it might be difficult for her to afford a high-profile lawyer, and if she was to find an ordinary lawyer, why not let her do it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, are you going to help me with my lawsuit?" Kyla seemed happy.</p></div>
