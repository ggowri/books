        <h1>Chapter 1877</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Watts, let&rsquo;s go to the hospital first. You can ask him yourself once your fever is gone," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay... Okay, I... I'll ask him myself!" Mrs. Watts mumbled and fell asleep again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Old Lawyer Watts glanced at each other before carrying Mrs. Watts out of the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, as soon as she left the apartment, the men guarding Mrs. Watts stopped them again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Madam, Old Lawyer Watts can leave anytime he wants, but Young master Reed didn't say that Old Lawyer Watts's... wife could leave!" they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm taking my mentor's wife to the hospital. Get out of the way!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry." They would not move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace just continued to walk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Madam, don't give us a hard time!" they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You know as well that I'm the young madam and the mistress of the Reed family. I want to take her away. If anything happens, I'll take responsibility. But if you keep blocking me, I won't let any of you off if anything happens to Mrs. Watts! You can see whether I&rsquo;ll keep my word!" Grace threatened them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The men looked at each other and eventually stepped back, allowing Grace and Old Lawyer Watts to leave with Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the three's back, one of them quickly called Jason's phone number. However, moments later, he put down the phone with a pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Young master Reed..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No one answered the phone," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace got in the car with Mrs. Watts and Old Lawyer Watts. She said to Old Lawyer Watts, "Mentor, I'll drive you out of town now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" Old Lawyer Watts was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You need to go back to L City. I'll send you to Emerald City's freeway, and someone will take you back to L City," said Grace. At least, her mentor had his own connections in L City, which would make things easier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jason..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll explain everything to Jay. We shouldn't let Mrs. Watts's illness drag on. Besides, even if Jay does report it to the police, you and Mrs. Watts would already be in L City. You should have a way to let the case be tried in L City," said Grace. This was the best way she could think of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Since Jay insisted on having Mrs. Watts pay the price and go to jail, then they should do it in L City where her mentor had more influence! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hearing this, Old Lawyer Watts sighed. He knew as well that it was best for them to go back to L City now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But if you let us return to L City and Jason finds out, you two will..." Old Lawyer Watts said with a look of guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace smiled reassuringly. "I'll try to get Jay to forgive me. Don't worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car drove toward Emerald City's freeway. Grace knew that she had to hurry up and have her mentor and his wife leave Emerald City before Jay woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was already four in the morning, and the sky was still dark. There were hardly any cars on the road, but Grace could not relax even for a moment.</p></div>
