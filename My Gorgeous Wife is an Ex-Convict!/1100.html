        <h1>Chapter 1099</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, Dr. Russell. I didn't expect... him to bring you here either," Grace said awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Dr. Russell did not ask any more questions. After all, at his age, he naturally knew that there were some questions he should not ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he just spread out the tools he had brought with him and asked Grace to hold out her right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The various needle knives reminded Grace of the pain she felt the last time she had the treatment, and it made her tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when Dr. Russell was about to insert a needle knife into the back of Grace's hand, Jason immediately grabbed Dr. Russell's wrist. "What is this for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Treatment, what else is there?" grumbled Dr. Russell. He hated being interrupted like that during his sessions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're using needle knives for the treatment, why not anesthetize her first?" asked Jason as he frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I anesthetize her, I can't get a clear reaction from her fingers. I need her most natural reaction for the treatment!" said Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was still hesitating. "But these needle knives..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up at Jason and said, "It's alright. I had the treatment once. Besides, this pain will go away after a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's just like bearing the pain when I was in prison. It'll pass.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had suffered the pain in prison without hope. Now, she suffered it with some hope. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted her fingers to be flexible again. Though they might not be as good as they were, it was worth the pain if they could get better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's expression changed slightly. Her words seemed to remind him of something. He let go of Dr. Russell's hand but immediately held Grace's left hand with their fingers interlaced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing?" she asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just grab my hand if you&rsquo;re in pain. I'll suffer the pain with you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks, I can stand it." She tried to pull her fingers out of his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he held on to her hand and looked at Dr. Russell. "That's all. Let's start."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell looked at Grace and Jason, unable to stop himself from sighing. He recalled how Brian had also stretched his hand out for Grace to hold the last time Grace came to his clinic for treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When two men did something similar to the same woman, it was obvious what it meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least one of the two was bound to fail, and this man seemed to be Brian's equal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell's mind sifted through the people in Emerald City who were similar in age to Brian. A moment later, he shuddered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason. Emerald City's Master Reed!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the way here, he had heard those who brought him here mentioning &lsquo;Master Reed&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This man can't be Jason, can he?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Dr. Russell stopped thinking about it. His main priority now was to treat Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sharp needle knife stabbed into the back of Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened, making a conscious attempt to clench her fist to bear the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her left hand was holding his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could feel her nails digging deep into his flesh, and even though her nails were usually trimmed and short, she knew that if she held on with such force, his hands would get hurt.</p></div>
