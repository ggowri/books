        <h1>Chapter 1806</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed walked up to Grace a little hesitantly. There seemed to be a look of struggle on his little face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mick, what's wrong?" Grace looked at her eldest son in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed's face was tense and slightly red. Then, he hugged Grace, who had crouched down, and kissed her on the cheek. "Mommy, I... I... missed... I missed you too..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed's face grew redder after saying this. After all, it was the first time he was saying such a thing in front of so many people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After saying that, Mick Reed saw a happy and excited smile on his mother's face. He suddenly felt happy to have said those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If his mother liked it, then&hellip; he would voice out more in the future. However, it would be difficult&hellip; if she wanted him to do and say the same things as his sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was a little boy nearby watching what was going on. He had seen the woman before and knew she was Jasper Reed's mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She's also the woman Mommy hates!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His mother had once told him that he and Jasper could never be friends. He did not understand why at the time, but now he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His mother almost killed this woman. He had received a lot of criticism while he was here. Everybody knew whose child he was as well as what his mother had done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The child of a maid had even run up to him and spat at him, saying he was the child of a bad person so he would also be a bad person in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is Mommy... a bad person? I guess so, but she's also my mommy. That's never going to change.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He remembered Jasper jumping in front of him and shielding him. The spit got all over her new beautiful pink dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The maid's child had paled with fear and they could not say a word. The other maids&rsquo; children were also stunned as they watched the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper said in a loud and clear voice, "His mommy&rsquo;s the one who did something bad, not him. He's not a bad kid, and he's never going to be one!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, she took him by the hand and went back to her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked a little regretfully at her dirtied dress. "What a pity. I like this dress a lot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry," he uttered those two words, which was rare for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper blinked in confusion. "Why are you apologizing to me? You're not the one who spat on my dress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you hadn't shielded me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I did it of my own accord," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, she asked the maid in charge of looking after her to help her get another dress to change into.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">From then on, the pink dress was deeply imprinted into his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After she changed out of her dirtied dress, she played the piano with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She kept having him play the piano with her these days, and he was also amazed at her piano skills. His piano teacher once said he was a genius.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it seemed to him that she was more gifted than he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although he could play all the notes perfectly, it seemed that the music he played was never as beautiful as hers. 'Is this what the teacher meant by playing with feelings?'</p></div>
