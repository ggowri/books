        <h1>Chapter 4182 Begging</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you know what you're saying?" Edmond stared fiercely at Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes," Kit said, "I won't listen to father anymore. Likewise, I will finish the last movie I have signed up for, and after that, I will retire from the entertainment industry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> That movie was given to him by Tina, so no matter what, he would finish it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After finishing it, he would completely retire!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What?" Edmond looked at his son in shock, "You want to retire, are you talking nonsense?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm not joking, I'm serious," Kit said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Edmond's face turned extremely ugly. "You better think it through. If you quit the entertainment industry, you'll have nothing. Even if you're my son, I won't help you in any way, and I'll take back the house I gave you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit replied calmly, "I've thought it through. I will quit the entertainment industry. As for what you want to do, it's up to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He had always been afraid of having nothing, so he climbed up desperately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But at this moment, when his father said he would have nothing, there was no longer that fear in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Perhaps it was because the thing he feared the most had already happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Compared to Tina, he realized that not having anything wasn't as scary as he had thought!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Moreover, from the beginning, she had nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You ungrateful child!" Edmond couldn't control himself and slapped Kit's face again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The other side of Kit's cheek now bore the marks of five fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit, however, remained calm as if he didn't feel the pain on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because for him, the pain in his heart was even stronger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It kept throbbing, again and again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> 72 hours of the golden search period had passed, a week had passed, half a month had passed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina still hadn't been found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This river led directly to the sea outside the city, so it was very likely that Tina's body had been washed into the sea by the current. But no one dared to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler continued to stay on the boat day and night, searching for Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When he was hungry, he would take a few bites of bread; when he was thirsty, he would drink a few sips of water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even when others advised Chandler to get off the boat and rest, he rejected them all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was like a madman searching for Tina on the surface of the river, not giving up even a glimmer of hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When Eugenia saw Chandler, she could hardly believe that the person in front of her was Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The man who used to look handsome and cold now wore wrinkled clothes, disheveled hair, and a face full of stubble, looking exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Chandler, that's enough!" Eugenia couldn't help but cry. "Please take a rest. If you don't rest properly, your body will collapse. If Tina knew that you were destroying yourself to find her, she would be upset."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After hearing the name "Tina," Chandler's body stiffened. "Tina doesn't like the cold. If she's in the water, she'll definitely complain. I... I need to find her quickly. I can't let her stay in the cold water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Even if we're searching and there are others helping, we haven't found her after all these days. Doesn't that mean Tina is still alive? Maybe she's been washed ashore somewhere, or maybe someone took her to the hospital..." Eugenia choked up.</p></div>
