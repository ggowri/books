        <h1>Chapter 1369</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled lightly. "If I'm going to die one day, I won't die in front of you because I don't want you to be the last person I see!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." He glared at her. He only found her words making his heart feel stuffy with pain. "Stop talking about dying all day long. What's the matter? Are you going to die to get my sympathy now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not answer him but lowered her head to swallow the pills one at a time until she was done. Then, she looked up and stared at him without wavering, saying, "Well then, do you feel sorry for me? If I were to die and you had the chance to save me, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was shocked. 'What does she mean? Is she dying?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The speculation flashed through his mind, but he dismissed it. 'How can it be? She&rsquo;s only saying this to get my sympathy, or perhaps she has some other motives.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could I possibly save you? Forget about it. Kyla Corbyn, I won't save you even if you die in front of me today!" he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled gently. "I thought so too. Martin Weiss, thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was stunned. Her thanks sounded so irritating. "Why are you thanking me? Is that sarcasm?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I really want to thank you," she said lightly. Her eyes shifted to her son who was still at the playground not far away. He was interacting with other children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to thank Martin Weiss for breaking her unrealistic fantasies, for letting her know that she was right to get over this man. She wanted to thank him for letting her get out of this relationship that was wrong from the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If there's another life, I hope we don't meet again." She did not even want to see him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face turned more and more gloomy. 'Don't meet again? Who does she think she is?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why did he feel so uncomfortable at the sight of her being this calm?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the amusement park, Martin Weiss drove Kyla Corbyn and Nelson home. The little one fell asleep next to Kyla Corbyn as soon as he got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We've gone to the amusement park now. Don't try any more tricks. Send Nelson over when the time is up. If you break your promise, don't blame me for showing no mercy," Martin Weiss said abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn only found it ridiculous. 'When has he had mercy for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't go back on my word. I just... hope you'll be nicer to Nelson," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's my son. Of course, I'll be nice to him," Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said nothing more. She only turned her head and looked at her son fondly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car arrived below the apartment, Kyla Corbyn was about to carry her son upstairs when Martin Weiss said, "I'll carry him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks, Mr. Weiss. I can carry Nelson." Kyla Corbyn refused. "I hope you can hug Nelson more when he starts living with you. I'll carry him for now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She picked the little one up and turned to head to the apartment's elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her back. As she was carrying the child, her back seemed slightly bent. She seemed to be struggling but still held the child to her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Has she held the child like this... all these years?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been carrying the child like this countless times when he still did not know of Nelson&rsquo;s existence...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's heart suddenly seemed to be stung by something.</p></div>
