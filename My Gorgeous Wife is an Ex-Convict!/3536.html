        <h1>Chapter 3534</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow family's business became even more difficult, as Archer repeatedly asked Veronica to reconcile with Mason. Otherwise, there would be no one to do business with the Barlow family, almost like giving away money as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In response to her father's request, Veronica simply said, "Dad, Mason won't reconcile with me. Even if I go to him again, it won't make any difference."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know where your food and drink come from? If you don't reconcile with Mason soon, our whole family will be out of business. Don't blame me for not recognizing you as my daughter!" Archer said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then don't recognize me," Veronica said. She was tired, really tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the Barlow family, she had always been just a tool to maintain the relationship with the Reed family. All the kindness shown to her by the Barlow family was only for their own benefit. Once they lost that benefit, everything would go back to the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, Veronica moved back to her old house alone. This house was left to her by her mother, and Archer had changed the name of the homeowner to Veronica's name early on in order to please her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This gave Veronica a place of her own to live independently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, seeing that Veronica was not willing to take action, Archer had to personally go to the Reed family. But on the Reed family's side, he hit a snag, which made Archer even more embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's situation at school was also becoming increasingly embarrassing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were always people making sarcastic remarks in her ear, and even when she walked around the school, there were some people who didn't even know her and were pointing and talking about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One afternoon, while she was getting her lunch in the school cafeteria and heading towards an empty table to eat, someone suddenly stuck out their foot and tripped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her food spilled all over the floor, and the other person said with a joking tone, "I couldn't walk properly earlier, turns out it's Mason from the Reed family's sister. Wait, that's not right, the Reed family only has two sisters, no older sister. Plus, your last name is Ho, not Reed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, now Mason from the Reed family has cut ties with her. I heard from my mom that her dad has been begging for help everywhere!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Their family is like a bunch of bloodsuckers. If it weren't for Mason, they wouldn't have any money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These mocking words kept pouring into Veronica's ears, and she knew very well that in the eyes of others, she was nothing more than a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite being surrounded by so many people, no one came up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even her former classmates who used to flatter her now keep their distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's nose tingles with a sense of loss. There was someone who would always stand in front of her whenever she was in danger, but that person is no longer around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This bitter feeling of wanting to cry grows stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wants to cry not because she was bullied, but because the person she thought she would always rely on is no longer by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stood up in embarrassment, determined not to let herself cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she wanted to cry, she didn't want to do it in front of these mocking people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening after school, Veronica walked out of the campus and unexpectedly saw the Reed family's driver. He stopped in front of her and said, "Miss He, Madam is waiting for you in the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica turned her head and saw a black Maybach parked not far away.</p></div>
