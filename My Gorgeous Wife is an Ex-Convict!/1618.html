        <h1>Chapter 1616</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every word she said was as painful as death by a thousand paper cuts. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Or if I have to find another man so you can stop showing up before me, then I&rsquo;ll look for one," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss could hardly stand still. 'Did she really just say that? Does she really...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you hate me that much?" he murmured. His words seemed to come from the back of his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It&rsquo;s not exactly hatred, but every time I see you, it brings back those old nightmares. Martin Weiss, do you know you're a nightmare to me? I just want to put all those bad things that have happened to me behind me,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was despair in his eyes, and the five fingers that had held her wrist tightly let go and fell to his side. He seemed to fill with a feeling of despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Nightmare...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It turns out that I'm just a nightmare to her. The sight of me only reminds her of those grievances!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the indifference on Kyla's face, Martin Weiss suddenly had a premonition that he might never be able to walk into the woman's heart again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even... maybe all he could do for her was to... 'never see each other!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If... never seeing each other is what you want, then I'll do as you wish," muttered Martin Weiss. The decision was like a gut-wrenching pain to him, but... he was willing to comply with her wishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every time she saw him was a nightmare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then let her nightmare be over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He seemed to grow older all of a sudden. "I'll leave you alone. If you encounter any trouble you can't solve, you can also call the company or leave a message in any company under the Weiss Group if you don't want to call me. You just have to tell them your name, and someone will help you. You don't even... have to see me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She still looked indifferent. It was as if anything he said could no longer affect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss stared at Kyla. She was so close to him. The moonlight fell on her face, and the traces of time on her face looked so clear in the moonlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was cold and distant now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She used to be...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He seemed to go back to the past with her cheerful voice ringing in his ears as she smiled at him sweetly. She said, "Martin, I'm glad you're my first love! Hehe!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin, tell me. How did I get so lucky to find a boyfriend like you? My friends envy me and ask how I managed to snag you! Tell me, did I snag you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if we separate one day, you must find me and bring me back to you. We&rsquo;ve promised to never separate!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... he could not bring her back to him after all. He found her, but... he was the one who had pushed her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The illusion of their past overlapped with reality before Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could not help but reach out to touch her cheek as if subconsciously trying to hold on to a glimmer of their beautiful past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, Kyla jerked her body to the side and dodged Martin Weiss's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hand missed and stopped in mid-air, dragging him back to reality.</p></div>
