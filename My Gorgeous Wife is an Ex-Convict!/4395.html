        <h1>Chapter 4393: How Could She Possibly Like Him</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Tina and her daughter were a bit too enthusiastic, but they really do like you. Tina thinks highly of you. She says you're bound to make it big in the entertainment industry, and not just as a flash in the pan, but as a lasting star. Tina has always had a knack for spotting talent in celebrities."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert gave a shy smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yearned for fame, not for its own sake, but so he could stand beside her, worthy of her love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... if that day really comes, would he have the courage to pursue her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, she was high above, an existence he needed to look up to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And also..." Harley's voice paused, "I have something to ask you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up?" Calvert asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like me?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When these words were spoken, Calvert was taken aback. He stared blankly at </span><span>Harley,</span><span> his eyes full of confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean the kind of liking between a man and a woman, not the kind of liking between friends," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip awkwardly, his dark eyes filled with struggle and hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How should he respond to her? If he tells the truth, then all his feelings over the years will be laid bare before her. What would she think of him then?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the train car, it suddenly became completely quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert, I want the truth," Harley's voice echoed again, like a stone thrown into his heart, causing ripples.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." His mouth was dry, his head bowed, his heart pounding wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind went blank. What kind of answer should he give her at a time like this?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you answer?" Harley's voice was asking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not!" He responded almost subconsciously. After a while, he slowly lifted his head, looking at the person in front of him, his voice trembling slightly as he said, "Yes, I like you. I like you in the way a man likes a woman."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a short sentence, but she had no idea how much courage it took for him to say it!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stared blankly at the person in front of him, his face flushed red. The unease, affection, and nervousness in his dark eyes were completely undisguised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, even if Calvert hadn't said it, she could feel that he liked her, perhaps even loved her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all this while, she's only ever seen him as a friend, never once considering the possibility of a romantic relationship between them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I got it!" In the end, that's what she responded with.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides this sentence, she suddenly didn't know what else to say!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's eyes gradually dimmed, and the once anxious heart seemed to slowly sink into an unfathomable abyss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Harley dropped him off at his residential complex that he got out of the car, looking lost. He managed to squeeze out a smile, "I'm sorry, if my answer earlier upset you, you can pretend you never heard it. Can we... can we still be friends?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley hesitated for a moment, "Let me think about it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body gave a slight shudder, "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the car slowly disappear from his sight, Calvert felt as if all his strength had been drained away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she just reject him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right, they must have rejected it!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly be worthy of her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he has a so-called handsome face that many people like, she has seen him at his lowest. How could she possibly like him!</span></p></div>
