        <h1>Chapter 1515</h1>
        <div><p>“No. There must be a reason why he hasn’t come,” Grace said, “He’ll definitely like you when he sees you.”</p><p>As for the reason why Jay had not come looking for her… He probably thought she was dead.</p><p>She had searched for related news on the internet. Her identity on the internet was Jason’s ‘deceased wife’.</p><p>When the train arrived in Emerald City, Grace held her daughter’s hand as they exited the carriage. When they reached the exit, she saw the silhouette of someone she used to be familiar with in the past. The person was waiting anxiously at the exit.</p><p>It was… Lina!</p><p>Grace’s eyes reddened instantly. She had forgotten about Lina in the past few years. It was after she recovered her memories when she finally re-established contact with Lina. </p><p>Grace still remembered how Lina had been completely in disbelief when she called her. The two of them had a video call afterward, and only after that did Lina believe that she was still alive. </p><p>“Lina!” At this moment, Grace shouted. When Lina heard her, she turned toward Grace and her eyes immediately reddened. </p><p>When Grace and her daughter walked over and stood in front of Lina, she was already in tears.</p><p>“You really… You really are still alive! I knew that you wouldn’t have died so easily! I knew it!” Lina hugged Grace tightly and shouted in between sobs. </p><p>Grace hugged her good friend back. Her eyes were also red. “Sorry, I’ve made you worry these past few years.”</p><p>“Oh, this is Jaylee, isn’t she?” Lina sobbed. She looked at the young girl beside Grace. She resembled Grace, but there was a little of Jason in her as well.</p><p>Lina had seen this kid before during previous video calls, but this was the first time they were meeting face to face.</p><p>“Godmother!” Jaylee said cutely, her soft voice softening Lina’s heart.</p><p>Lina squatted on the floor, raising her hand to pinch the kid’s soft cheek. How nice. It turned out that… more than one of Grace’s children had survived.</p><p>“This is not a good place to talk. Let’s leave first,” Grace said.</p><p>Only then did Lina come back to her senses. She said quickly, “Yes, yes, let’s continue this somewhere else.” God knew she had too many words she wanted to say. There were so many things that they had not managed to say during their video calls! </p><p>The three of them left the train station. Lina drove. She took Grace and her daughter to a children’s restaurant. They ordered food.</p><p>“Right, what’s Jaylee’s full name?” Lina asked. She knew that Grace’s daughter was named Jaylee after their video call. </p><p>She had paused for a while the first time she heard that name. She did not expect Grace to use ‘Jay’ in her daughter’s name. </p><p>Jason. Jay. Jaylee.</p><p>Even though Grace had lost her memories, she was still naturally attuned to the man’s name.</p><p>“Jaylee Cummins.”</p><p>“Jasper Reed.”</p><p>Both mother and daughter said at the same time. After that, Grace looked at her daughter. “Didn’t Mommy tell you that you have to change your name? It should be Jasper now.”</p><p></p></div>
