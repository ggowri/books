        <h1>Chapter 1413</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This woman had pushed him into hell with her mouth full of lies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, he wanted her to atone for it for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After walking out of the ward, Martin Weiss only felt that his heart was under some heavy pressure, making him gasp for breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He hated Paisley Daniels for fooling him and for setting Kyla Corbyn up. He hated himself even more for being so foolish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Daniels family had only moved their mouths and he stabbed the woman who saved his life with an invisible knife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even when he had stepped into the ward just now, the scenes of how he had forced Kyla Corbyn to kneel and grovel in the same ward recurred to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sound of her forehead hitting the floor seemed to echo in his ears, stinging him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why was I so cruel?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did I do it for Paisley Daniels? Or... was I just hurting her to conceal my care for her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because he felt she had made a fool of him and that she made Paisley miscarry as she was after the Weiss family&rsquo;s fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, he flew into a rage out of humiliation and vented his anger in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was right when she said he was blind. He could not even see who was fooling him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mister... Mr. Weiss, what Paisley Daniels did has nothing to do with me. I... I've said everything I needed to say. Let me go," Shane Currey repeatedly pleaded for mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had already gotten on the plane but was suddenly taken here. Then, the person who took him here told him to confess everything about him and Paisley Daniels to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Otherwise, he would probably be in jail for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That was why he confessed to everything. If he had known Paisley Daniels was going to give him trouble, he would have stayed away from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But... who the hell was behind getting me here? What other big shots have Paisley Daniels offended beside Martin Weiss?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Shane Currey was severely scolding Paisley Daniels in his heart but still had to smile at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let you go?" Martin Weiss sneered. If he let Shane Currey go, who would let him go? "I don't care about you and Paisley Daniels, but you shouldn't have helped her tamper with the bone marrow donation information and watch her take credit for Kyla Corbyn's donation!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss ordered his men as he spoke, "Take him to the police station."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His men responded and left with Shane Currey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Shane Currey was taken away, he could not help shouting, "Martin Weiss, since you don't care about me and Paisley Daniels, why should you care about the bone marrow donation? So what if Kyla Corbyn donated it? She's just an ordinary woman. Didn't you send her to prison for Paisley? And now you're acting remorseful?"</p></div>
