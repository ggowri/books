        <h1>Chapter 514</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had been a long time since she felt this way. Even though she knew that Grace was with Jason, she did not think that Grace had beaten her. After all, she was Brian's official girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Evelyn now felt that she was being outdone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian came back to his senses and said to Grace, "It seems quite a coincidence to see you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello," Grace responded simply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned his eyes to Jason. "I didn't expect you to be here today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I brought Grace here to show her around. After all, there are some people she is bound to know someday," Jason said lightly. However, there was just too much information in that one sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was shocked. What did he mean by 'bound to know'? Was Jason&hellip; hinting that he would marry Grace someday?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn felt another pang of jealousy at the thought of this, but she put on a smile and said, "Long time no see, Sis. Speaking of which, I've been wanting to apologize to you. Mom and Dad had no ill intentions, but they mishandled the matter regarding your mother&rsquo;s grave. There was a misunderstanding, so they said the wrong thing. Don't take it seriously, Sis. Dad misses you a lot these days. Why don't you go home and visit him when you're free?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's words were very condescending as if it had really all been a misunderstanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled a little. "There's no need to apologize. After all, it's none of your business, is it? What do you want to apologize for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said it lightly, but it made Evelyn a little speechless for a moment. She could only look like she was wronged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only glanced at Evelyn, slightly frowning. He did not know what the sisters were talking about, but it was clearly nothing good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, you're tired. I'll take you over there to rest," said Jason as he turned to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Grace responded with a sweet smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile made Brian fall into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was about to leave, Brian could not help reaching out and grabbing Grace's wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stopped in her tracks. She looked strangely at her wrist that was in Brian&rsquo;s hand, then at Brian. "Mr. Hart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only then that Brian recovered from his trance. What was wrong with him? The person in front of him was not the one he was looking for. He knew that, but when she was about to leave earlier, he seemed to have traveled back to the old days. The little girl had also smiled and told him to take good care of his wound. She said that they would meet soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after he let go of her hand, they never saw each other again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many times, he had dreamed of seizing the hand and not wanting to let go. Many times, he had woken up regretting why he let her go back then. If he had not let go, perhaps she would still be with him right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian knew that he should release her hand, but his hand seemed to go against his will. He continued to hold her hand, refusing to release it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another hand grabbed Brian's wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I think you'd better let go. I don't like to see another man grabbing my girlfriend's wrist like that," Jason's voice rang coldly, and his bright amorous eyes were icy cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had known Jason for many years, so he knew Jason well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He might look indifferent sometimes as his gaze was usually casual and unconcerned. However, it was not the same now. His eyes were cold, and Brian felt pain shooting up from his wrist.</p></div>
