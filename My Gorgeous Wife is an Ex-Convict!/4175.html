        <h1>Chapter 4173 Father-in-law's Thoughts</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler pondered for a moment. "I will mention it to the police and have them investigate Mr. Perkins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, he said to Tina, "Recently, I will arrange for some people to be by your side to protect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina wanted to say it wasn't necessary, but seeing Chandler's worried expression, she nodded. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the next few days, Tina would have bodyguards by her side, protecting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia, seeing this situation, pulled her friend aside and said, "Why did Chandler arrange so many bodyguards to follow you? Did something happen? Is he worried that you'll run away before the wedding, so the domineering CEO hired all these bodyguards to keep an eye on you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina rolled her eyes in exasperation. "Do I look like someone who would run away from a wedding?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well... not really. I can see the desire in your eyes to devour Chandler!" Eugenia teased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina couldn't help but laugh at her friend's joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in truth, Eugenia's words were not far from the truth. She did have that desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Speaking of which, if you didn't want to run away, why are there so many bodyguards around you? Could it be that there's a woman madly in love with Chandler, and he's worried that she might harm you out of jealousy, so he's protecting you like this?" Eugenia asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not because someone loves him, but because someone might have a grudge against him. So he's worried about my safety," Tina explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A grudge?" Eugenia shuddered and imagined a series of dramatic scenes in her mind, then glanced at the bodyguards following her friend. "Well, maybe Chandler should hire even more people. I don't think the number of bodyguards is enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It shouldn't be a problem. In a few more days, we should be able to successfully catch that person," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Ever since they identified Mr. Perkins as the mastermind behind the scenes, the police have been secretly investigating him and have gathered some evidence. They will soon launch a capture operation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "That's good," Eugenia reassured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But since that person hasn't been caught yet, let's not talk about this to anyone else," Tina reminded once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Don't worry," Eugenia replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, in the evening, when Chandler came to pick up Tina, he delivered some bad news, "Mr. Perkins has escaped."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What?" Tina exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But the police have already issued an online wanted notice for Mr. Perkins, and they have also deployed officers. They should be able to catch him in a few days!" Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Hmm," Tina responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In Tina's eyes, Mr. Perkins was truly insane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Not only did he exploit resources and commit such acts against Kit, but he also directly set fire to the Hunter family's factory as revenge against Chandler and her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If it hadn't been for someone discovering the fire in time, the consequences could have been even more devastating, and many people could have died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Therefore, Tina only hoped that the police could catch Mr. Perkins as soon as possible and bring him to justice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Unfortunately, on the day of Tina's wedding, Mr. Perkins still hadn't been caught.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> On the bright side, her unborn baby was doing well. All the check-ups showed normal results, and all the indicators were good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Upon learning about his daughter's pregnancy, Hadwin was both happy and angry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was happy because he would have a third generation, but angry because his daughter was now pregnant at such a young age and would become a mother so early. Moreover, pregnancy and childbirth are too strenuous for women!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As a result, after learning about his daughter's pregnancy, Hadwin became even more critical of Chandler, finding fault with everything he did.</p></div>
