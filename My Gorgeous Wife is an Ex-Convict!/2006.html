        <h1>Chapter 2004</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There are many things I want to do with them. For instance, I want to play games together, hug and kiss them, and hold the soft and chubby baby to sleep. By the way, I can also listen to songs and dance with them. Speaking of which, the boy band I've been following lately has some dances that would look super cute if children danced along!&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was speechless. He had a hunch that perhaps his worst fears would come true in a few years. If their child fangirled with her, then he...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson felt miserable as he imagined it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina continued with her wonderful imagination. "If I can meet those boy bands and celebrities with the baby, they could also kiss the baby... Wow, they're so much luckier than me! My mom never took me to meet celebrities when I was little."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson wondered how his future mother-in-law would feel if she heard what her daughter had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"By the way, Hadwin, if my anomaly scan turns out okay, can I go and see DZM for an autograph and take some photos with them when they're in Emerald City?" Lina looked &lsquo;intently&rsquo; at Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she meant was to let Hadwin Stephenson find a way to achieve her wish, of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly felt his head hurt. DZM was the boy band she had been obsessed with recently. "They're coming to Emerald City for a concert. Do you think it's appropriate to attend a concert when you're six months pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm not attending the concert. I just want to see them up close and shake their hands or something," Lina said immediately. Although she wanted to attend the concert, her body was not in the right shape to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could only attend concerts after delivering the baby,</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin, the doctor said it's important that pregnant women stay happy," added Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson felt helpless at the sound of it. In the end, he sighed and said, "Okay, I'll take you to see them for autographs, photos, and handshakes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was an easy task for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina cheered and immediately embraced Hadwin Stephenson's neck as she kissed his cheek again and again. "You're the best. I love you so much!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson would have been disgusted if another woman was the one speaking so dramatically. However, he enjoyed it when Lina said these words to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're dead meat if you ever stop loving me!" said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't worry, how could I not love you?! I'm never going to find another man like you who&rsquo;s handsome, rich, has a good figure, and likes me so much," she said as her hands tried to take advantage of him too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was amused by Lina's cheekiness. "Are you so sure I like you that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don&rsquo;t you?" Her round eyes stared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could not say something against his conscience under her gaze. "Yeah, I do like you. I like you so much..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was probably going to lose to her all his life, but he had no regrets!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The bed was cold at night!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's tiny body curled up under the covers. He knew Jasper had gone out for dinner with Uncle Reed and aunt Cummins. His warm bed had now seemed to turn cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'When will Jasper be back? Will she come into my room again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His mind could not help wondering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, he heard a noise outside.</p></div>
