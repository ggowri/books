        <h1>Chapter 1358</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's face showed a look of surprise. 'He... wants me to apologize to Paisley Daniels? Is there anything more ridiculous than asking someone who was framed to apologize to the person who framed them?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not the one who owed an apology for four years. It was Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, is spending time with your son a quid pro quo for something like that?" she murmured, the look of surprise on her face vanishing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly felt embarrassed at this moment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's up to me whatever terms I make!" Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath and said calmly, "Okay, I'll do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels waited anxiously in the presidential suite for Martin Weiss to return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect to see Martin Weiss and Kyla Corbyn coming in together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, why did you bring her in..." Paisley Daniels asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss did not speak, while Kyla Corbyn walked over to Paisley Daniels. She bent over and said with her head down, "Miss Daniels, what happened back then was all my fault. I shouldn't have pushed you down the stairs and made you lose your child. I deserved to go to prison. Please forgive me, Miss Daniels."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's eyes widened in surprise as she did not understand what was happening. 'What the hell is going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, what's this?" Paisley Daniels looked at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's apologizing to you. What about you? Are you going to forgive her?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was silent for a moment. She could not figure out what Martin Weiss had in mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked coldly at Kyla Corbyn. "It seems that your apology is too simple. Paisley doesn't even want to forgive you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn glanced up at Martin Weiss before kneeling in front of Paisley Daniels. "Miss Daniels, can you forgive me now?" There were no emotions in her voice. It was as if even kneeling like this was nothing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Paisley Daniels could speak, Martin Weiss hauled Kyla Corbyn up from the ground. "Do you like kneeling so much?" His voice lost its usual calmness as he roared. He only found it irritating to his eyes the moment he saw her kneel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you think that my apology was too simple, Mr. Weiss? Or if kneeling isn't enough, tell me what you want me to do. Shall I roll down the stairs too?" Kyla Corbyn said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her calmness was in sharp contrast to his anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"F*ck off!" He growled, shoving her straight out of the suite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please don't forget what you promised me, Mr. Weiss," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips tightly together, and those long narrow eyes of his glared at her. Then, with a bang, he slammed the door shut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn touched her nose and looked at the already closed door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least, he did not reject it in the end, so... he probably agreed to it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help smiling wryly. She had thought that her already shattered dignity could not be in a worse state, but it had not occurred to her that it could shatter further as there was something more humiliating than imprisonment.</p></div>
