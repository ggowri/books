        <h1>Chapter 1386</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, you're wrong to say so." Paisley Daniels leisurely sipped on tea as she sat at the table. "Don't you feel ashamed when you lie in front of children? You were jealous of me for being with Martin, so you deliberately pushed me down the stairs. You wanted both me and the baby inside of me dead in one go, but I was strong and survived. However, it's a pity that the child in my belly..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels deliberately glanced at Nelson as she spoke, "My child would&rsquo;ve been about your son's age if they were still alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley Daniels, shut up!" said Kyla Corbyn. She knew Paisley Daniels was deliberately saying this in front of Nelson. Children should not be involved in adults' feuds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you feeling guilty? Otherwise, why are you getting so angry?" Paisley Daniels chuckled softly as she got up and slowly walked up to Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? I got together with your daddy but your mommy was jealous that he liked me, so she hurt me and the baby in my belly. Think about it, your mommy killed a kid who would otherwise be the same age as you now!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels spoke cruel words to a child with a smiling expression!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a precocious child, Nelson naturally understood what Paisley Daniels was saying, but he did not believe her words no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, my mommy didn't do it! Mommy said she has never hurt anyone!" the little one shouted at the top of his lungs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's just your mommy lying to you. Why did she go to prison if she hadn&rsquo;t hurt me? Prison is full of bad people!" Paisley Daniels said as she raised her hand to touch Nelson's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't touch my son!" Kyla Corbyn waved Paisley Daniels's hand away, fearing that Paisley Daniels would take action against her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had merely waved her hand to stop Paisley Daniels&rsquo;s hand that was reaching out to Nelson. At most, it would only hurt Paisley Daniels&rsquo;s hand a little. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Paisley Daniels leaned back exaggeratedly as if under some force. Her back touched the tablecloth. As the tablecloth was tugged, the things on the table instantly hurtled off the table and fell on Paisley Daniels, putting her in a terrible mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Paisley Daniels let out a cry of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Daniels rushed to Paisley Daniels's side with worry. She held her daughter and shouted to Kyla Corbyn, "Isn't it enough that you've hurt Paisley once? Do you want to hurt Paisley a second time? How can you have such a wicked heart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Daniels was even more furious. "Kyla Corbyn, I won't let you off if anything happens to Paisley!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at the scene before her and understood that the Daniels family was deliberately setting her up. This time, it was right in front of Nelson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are they planning to make Nelson think I'm a vicious woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'They even planned to injure Paisley Daniels just to make me look bad!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But... why is Paisley Daniels going to so much trouble if it's just to make Nelson misunderstand? There could have been an easier way. Unless it's...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speculation flashed across Kyla Corbyn's mind. Just then, the door to the private room opened suddenly. A familiar and cold voice asked, "What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn suddenly stiffened and even stopped breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The speculation in her mind came true at that moment.</p></div>
