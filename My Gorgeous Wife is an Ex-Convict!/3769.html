        <h1>Chapter 3767</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, even if he uses schemes and tricks, you still like him. If he plays tricks on you, will you forgive him?" Lawrence asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper replied, "William won't harm me. If one day he really has to use some tricks on me, I think it's because he has no other choice. I'm afraid he will feel even worse. Besides, I don't think that day will come, so there's no need for me to forgive anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really trust him!" Lawrence's voice was filled with jealousy that he couldn't hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is the person I love, of course I have to trust him!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of pain in his heart surged up again. If her loved one was William, then who was his loved one? Was it the person in front of him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, he couldn't love her. She should be the person he hated! The person he wanted to take revenge on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust?" He tried hard to suppress the pain in his heart and sneered, "But trust is also the easiest thing to collapse between people. You trust William, do you think William will trust you the same way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!" She said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's ridiculous!" He said, suddenly exerting force and pressing her whole body against the door. Her back was tightly against the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you trying to do..." Before she could finish her words, she felt a heat on her lips. His lips were already pressed against hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is he doing...kissing her?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suddenly widened her eyes and struggled hard, but she couldn't break free at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone was turning the doorknob, as if trying to open the door. But Jasper was forced to be pressed on the other side of the door, so the door couldn't be opened at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" someone's voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This door seems to be broken, we can't open it," someone replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? Can't open it? Let me try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Jasper felt someone twisting the door handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, her struggle suddenly stopped, and her whole body was highly concentrated. If she made any noise now, and the people outside saw her and Lawrence in this state in the dim room, who knows what kind of rumors would spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, she wouldn't have cared too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the whole school knows that she is dating William. She's not afraid of what others say, but she doesn't want William to be involved in any trouble or criticized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you nervous?" Lawrence's voice sounded low in her ear. "If I pull you away now and let the people outside come in, and they see us in this situation, what would they think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his face was very close to hers, and she finally saw the expression on his face clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he was threatening and intimidating her, but why did he have a pained expression on his face? It was as if he was the one being threatened and intimidated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you better not struggle anymore, don't move, otherwise I can't guarantee what will happen!" Lawrence whispered, and was about to kiss Jasper's lips again, but suddenly, a hand blocked his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand was in between their lips, and her almond eyes were so bright even in the dim room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, her eyes were full of anger and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, she was Jasper of the Reed family, who dared to treat her like this?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, this door must be broken. I'll tell the others later. After this round is over, we need to fix it quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's go over there first," said someone.</span></p></div>
