        <h1>Chapter 2097</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, she asked, "Hasn't Terrence found out where Martin Weiss took Kyla?" Her anxious tone and expression were as if all she cared about was Kyla right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason felt helpless. "Any moment now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough. After a while, Terrence finally stepped into the office to report Kyla's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace then learned that Martin Weiss had taken Kyla from the hospital. Also... Kyla went to the hospital to get a medical abortion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is Kyla aborting the baby?" Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That seems to be the case," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where is Kyla now?" Grace asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss has taken Kyla to his mansion in Emerald City," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace then looked at Jason, and Jason knew what his wife was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then let's go get Kyla so that you can be relieved, okay?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're the best, Jay," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Such a simple sentence made Jason's eyes become tinged with joy. Obviously, he was flattered by her &lsquo;flattery&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence was already used to it. He knew long ago that no one's flattery could beat one casual statement from Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Only Grace could make Young master Reed spare no effort in doing things for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed Young master Reed was doomed to be at this woman's beck and call all his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence quickly arranged a car and gave the driver the detailed address of Martin Weiss's mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As the car drove toward Martin Weiss's mansion, Grace still looked worried and anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Will the mansion&rsquo;s security guards refuse to let us in?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If they refuse to let us in, we'll just force our way in," Jason said casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Force our way in?" She blinked, looked at him, and then at herself. "Uh... Just the two of us?" Technically speaking, he would probably act alone. She only knew a few defensive moves. If they did get in a fight, they would probably get beaten up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But...' Grace remembered Jason was pretty good at fighting. Even so, if Martin Weiss had a lot of guards, he probably could not win them in numbers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you thinking about?" Jason reached out his hand and flicked Grace on the forehead. "We have many bodyguards behind us. Even if we do get into a fight, we don't need to fight them ourselves."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Huh?" Grace froze and turned to look behind the car. "Do we have many bodyguards behind us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had no idea which of these cars belonged to the bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason smiled faintly. "In short, since we're already heading there, I'll take you into Martin Weiss's mansion to bring Kyla out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was pacing back and forth in a room in the mansion. Martin Weiss had taken her here and locked her in this room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could not figure out what he was trying to do, and he had not confiscated her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In other words, she could contact the outside world anytime she wanted.</p></div>
