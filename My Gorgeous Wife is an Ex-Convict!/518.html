        <h1>Chapter 517</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick gulped the saliva in his mouth. All right, it was obvious that Grace, whom he had just met, would one day marry into the Reed family and become their mistress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, she's really lucky then," muttered Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm the lucky one," Jason let out a whisper. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that her misfortune had made him lucky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the accident had not happened, she might have married Sean and bore his child by now. She would not have met him the way they did and he would not know that it was such a pleasant thing to be by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was shocked when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only thinking of one thing at this moment&mdash;Jason had really fallen for Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a glass of champagne from the waiter and drank it. It had a low alcohol content and a fruity taste. It tasted pretty good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not take too much of it. She was not a good drinker. She would get drunk easily if she drank too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked around as she sipped her champagne. She could hear the sound of people toasting as she looked around at the successful people present. She used to be a part of this society. She had talked to some of these upper-class people and hoped to meet more as it would be good for her career in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in those days, she would dress up meticulously when attending banquets and try her best to talk to others. She feared that she would embarrass Sean when she stood next to him, so she wanted to make sure that it would not happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, looking back on it now made her feel like that had been centuries ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, several women came up to Grace. Their leader said, "You're Jason's date today, aren't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her head and recognized that the women were all famous socialites in Emerald City. She had seen them in some gossip magazines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To put it more accurately, she did not recognize these women simply because she had read about them in gossip magazines but because she used to go out of her way to collect information about Emerald City&rsquo;s socialites so as to not embarrass Sean whenever she went out with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Among the three women before her, one was the granddaughter of a jewelry tycoon, one was the daughter of a chairman of a convenience store chain, and the other was the granddaughter of an owner of a famous five-star hotel in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, the most famous of the three was the granddaughter of the jewelry tycoon, Elsie Jordan. She was beautiful and proud. She usually had many suitors, but she did not seem to fancy anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elsie Jordan once told the media, "The man I like is of course the best. Otherwise, I'd rather not date."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During that time, many media speculated that the man Elsie Jordan liked was probably Jason. However, Jason and Jennifer Atkinson got engaged not long after that, so the rumors about Elsie Jordan and Jason naturally faded away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart sank a little as she thought of Jennifer Atkinson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I am," she said as she stood up, knowing in her heart that these three women were not here with good intentions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Elsie Jordan. What's your name?" Elsie Jordan said with a smile on her face as if she was here to make friends with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not think she would want to be friends with her, but it was inappropriate not to answer her, so she politely replied, "Grace."</p></div>
