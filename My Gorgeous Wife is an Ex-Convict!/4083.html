        <h1>Chapter 4081</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> You need to differentiate between your feelings for your idol and your feelings for your loved ones, and know which is more important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It's precisely because her mother could differentiate between the two that even now, her father is still at ease with her mother's fan behavior and even helps her mother with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although occasionally, her father would get jealous, her mother would always soothe his emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Thinking of her mother's usual behavior of soothing her father's emotions, Tina raised her hand and stroked Chandler's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler was slightly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia, who was standing next to them, widened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> What was Tina doing? The way she was stroking Chandler's head, it was like she was petting a puppy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And it was in front of so many people!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia noticed that it wasn't just her who was watching Tina and Chandler, but everyone in the studio was looking over, even Kit and Weldon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So don't be jealous, okay? Be good, I love you the most!" Tina said while stroking Chandler's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia had the urge to faint. Come on, did Tina really treat Chandler like a puppy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's appearance made people think of a fierce beast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A CEO-level figure being coaxed like this by a woman in front of so many people... what if Chandler gets angry?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Eugenia was trembling with fear, Chandler whispered, "Alright, if you can really do what you say, then I won't be jealous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course!" Tina took the initiative to kiss Chandler on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although there were other people around, she really wanted to kiss him right now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina has always been the type of person who does what she wants, regardless of the opinions of those around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler's body suddenly trembled, his eyelashes drooped slightly, and he bent down slightly to match Tina's kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was strange, because when he watched her filming earlier, he didn't feel good. He had a feeling of discomfort, like something was gnawing at his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, that uncomfortable feeling had completely disappeared, leaving only his affection for her and a desire to touch her more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She seemed to have a magical power that could soothe all his anxieties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because of her frankness? Or was it because she... was the one he was destined to be with?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sight of a man and a woman kissing in public didn't make people feel uncomfortable at all. On the contrary, it was a beautiful scene, as if it was only natural for them to be together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weldon tightly held his camera. If it weren't for the fact that one of the people involved was Chandler, he might have already lifted his camera and captured this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he knew that Tina was Chandler's fianc&eacute;e, he didn't expect Chandler to let her kiss him in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hunter valued etiquette and family rules, and Chandler was the future leader of the family. But now he was acting like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Hunter's old-fashioned people saw this, who knows what they would think.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weldon looked at the scene in front of him with a mocking gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And at Kit, not far from Weldon, he was also watching the scene!</p></div>
