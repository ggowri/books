        <h1>Chapter 3122</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda gave a price range, and the real estate agent immediately agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the agent and Valda walked out of the apartment, Valda unexpectedly saw another person - Amber!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Amber saw Valda, she was clearly taken aback and said, "Valda, what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm here to see the house," said Valda. "Are you... living here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I live on the 9th floor of this building," said Amber. "What a coincidence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, what a coincidence!" Valda smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Amber happened to be free, Valda suggested they come to this nearby restaurant to sit down and learn more about the neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you thinking of buying a house again?" Amber asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm planning to bring my godmother over, the one who saved me and Lisa. So we'll need two rooms, and that's why I'm thinking of buying another house," Valda explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you buy here, we'll be neighbors," Amber joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, we'll be neighbors," Valda laughed. "By the way, what about Simon? Has he gone back to Deer Capital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not yet, he'll be staying in Emerald City for a few more days. Today, I had work to do, so George took Simon out for a walk," Amber said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"George is also in Emerald City?" Valda was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, he's been in Emerald City for a while now," Amber said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the CEO of a big corporation, it was easy to guess why he would stay in Emerald City for a period of time. Valda looked at Amber and asked, "What's going on between you and him...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's impossible," said Amber calmly. "Whatever happened between him and me is in the past. I don't want to force ourselves to be together for the sake of the child. It wouldn't make me happy, and it might not be good for the child's emotional development either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber sighed and said, "Actually, I think it's pretty good now. I can do the work I like and also spend time with my children when I'm free. Life is quite fulfilling for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You know what kind of day you want for yourself, that's great," Valda said with a hint of envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, have you not yet figured out what kind of life you want?" asked Amber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know, actually I shouldn't feel inferior. I should stand by Brian's side and face it together. But sometimes, there is always a feeling of fear in my heart." She laughed at herself, "Is it awkward for me to be so hesitant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, you just love Brian too much," said Amber. "Because you love him, you keep hesitating. But once you've made up your mind, you'll be extremely determined."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I feel a bit embarrassed by what you said," Valda said. She knew she should have taken that step earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, being able to stay with the person you love for your whole life is a difficult yet very happy thing. Don't let yourself have any regrets," Amber said sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda took a deep breath and said, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After bidding farewell, Valda hailed a taxi and headed towards Brian's company.</p></div>
