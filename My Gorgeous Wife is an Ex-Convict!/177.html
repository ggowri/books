        <h1>Chapter 176</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such an intimate action sent chills running down the manager and Mr. Grant&rsquo;s spines as fear crept up in their hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was said that Jason never had any woman beside him all this while. Even with his late fianc&eacute;e, Jennifer Atkinson, both of them remained courteous toward each other. Nobody ever saw him being so close to another woman before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Plus, he was demanding justice for a woman in public?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maria Martin knelt and stuttered as she made her apology. &ldquo;Grace, it... it is my fault. I shouldn&rsquo;t have said such things to you. I... I&rsquo;ll never do that again. Please forgive me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace observed Maria Martin but did not feel any pity for her. After all, Maria Martin had never been merciful toward her either. Grace was not a saint who could sympathize with someone who had always mocked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she just did not like such methods. Even if Maria Martin had knelt down to apologize, she did not have a sliver of pleasure in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Sis, do you want to forgive her?&rdquo; Jason mumbled to her as if giving her a chance to decide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You can make the decision.&rdquo; Grace lowered her lids. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry and want to eat.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Jason said as he once again held Grace&rsquo;s hand and motioned for the manager to lead the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager immediately led the way while Maria Martin was still dumbfounded as she continued to kneel on the ground, unable to digest what had just happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Earlier... Did Jason address Grace as &lsquo;sis&rsquo;?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;What is the meaning of that? Since when did Grace become Jason&rsquo;s sister? But the problem is... The body language that Jason portrayed toward Grace is not of a brother-sister relationship. Instead, it&rsquo;s more like... between lovers!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Jason left, Mr. Grant bellowed at Maria Martin, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drag me along even if you have a death wish! Remember this, it&rsquo;s not because I don&rsquo;t want to help your family, it&rsquo;s because you have offended Jason. I&rsquo;m powerless to help you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Mr. Grant headed for the restaurant exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maria Martin was abruptly brought back to reality and quickly got up. She chased after Mr. Grant as he went out of the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I... I didn&rsquo;t know that woman had any relations with Jason. She... she purposely tried to trap me into this. She purposely used Jason to get rid of me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if she had done it on purpose or not, but right now, Jason is backing her up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t Jason let me off the hook already? Earlier, he didn&rsquo;t do anything to me, isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo; Maria Martin anxiously said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Grant looked at Maria Martin as if he was looking at an idiot. He used to think that this woman had some wits, but right now, he found her extremely dumb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if any human would care if they had stepped on an ant and killed it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ignoring Maria Martin, Mr. Grant immediately drove off. Before leaving, he even warned her not to come looking for him ever again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maria Martin&rsquo;s expression twisted with a mix of emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;How did this happen? I put in so much effort to curry favor with Mr. Grant and even had put up with so many losses, but everything is now gone in just a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all because of Grace! If she wasn&rsquo;t with Jason... Then...&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a thought came to Maria Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that my car being smashed and my family&rsquo;s company facing a crisis are all because of Grace! Just because I mocked and harmed Grace? Is that why all those had happened?!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, everyone in her family had been busily discussing, wondering who they managed to offend. At this precise moment, Maria Martin suddenly knew the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Jason!</p></div>
