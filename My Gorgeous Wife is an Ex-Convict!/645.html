        <h1>Chapter 644</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked into the changing room with the wedding dresses in hand while Lina went in to help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the lounge outside the changing room, Jason and Hadwin sat in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin looked at Jason who was in front of him. To be honest, he was quite surprised that Jason was getting married to Grace so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I recently heard that you're helping Miss Cummins to reverse her case." Hadwin took the initiative to speak, trying to find a topic of conversation with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're well informed," said Jason as he raised his eyes to look at Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, that's mainly because Lina is concerned about Miss Cummins's case, so I&rsquo;m paying more attention to this matter. However, I heard that in the appeal filed by the law firm you appointed, the culprit of this case was Dexter Rios?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes slightly and did not make a sound. His amorous eyes only looked at him with a cold glimmer in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've also looked into Miss Cummins's case. Although Dexter Rios may indeed have tried to avoid responsibility by blaming Miss Cummins, why didn't the Atkinson family suspect anything when Dexter Rios resigned so soon after the sentence was handed down?" said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason asked coldly, "What are you trying to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just think there seems to be something wrong with the Atkinson family," Hadwin said with a smile. "The Atkinson family seemed to be in a hurry to convict Grace. All kinds of news media and public opinion were intentionally or unintentionally forcing the case to be sentenced as soon as possible. It took far less time than a normal case would have taken to proceed from prosecution to sentencing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's thin lips were drawn almost in a straight line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin only continued, "Of course, it can also be said to be a special case. The impact of the case was so great that it may have taken less time. However, now that it can be proved that Miss Cummins was wronged at the beginning, it's doubtful whether the Atkinson family knew about it or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said coldly, "Thank you so much for your concern for Grace, President Stephenson. The law will tell us what happened with the case and what the truth is. The police will check whether there's something wrong with the Atkinson family, and I'll get payback for all of Grace's sufferings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That would be best," said Hadwin. If Grace's case was successfully reversed and the real culprit behind it could be found, then Lina would probably be relieved and would not have to worry about Grace's case all day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of Lina's concern for Grace, Hadwin could not help but feel a touch of jealousy. Although this was &lsquo;friendship&rsquo;, their friendship was... Lina, in particular, liked to read comics and novels about men falling in love with each other. It had imparted the idea that love was genderless to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not for how her eyes lit up every time she saw a male idol, he might have suspected her of having an affair with Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the long curtain at the changing room was pulled open by the staff and Grace and Lina stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only had Grace changed her dress, but even Lina changed into a bridesmaid dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at her in the white wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dress was conservative with a high neckline and long sleeves, but the sleeves were made of lace. It effectively covered the shallow scars on her arms. The waistline was high and fitting while the hemline was spread out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hair was not tied up as it usually was, and the tiara-shaped headwear on her head looked dreamy as well as beautiful. She looked just like a pure angel standing there quietly, looking at him with a smile&hellip;</p></div>
