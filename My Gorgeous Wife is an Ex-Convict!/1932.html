        <h1>Chapter 1930</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney also said to Lina, "No matter what the final result is, your mother and I will always have your back. With our pension, we can afford to raise a grandchild!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's eyes immediately watered. She wilfully got pregnant out of wedlock and decided to give birth to the baby, but her parents remained to be her strongest backer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How lucky she was to be their daughter in this life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After saying goodbye to her parents, Lina walked toward Stephenson Group&rsquo;s building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I going to meet Hadwin? Or should I say, will Hadwin meet me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now that she recalled it, she had been so close to happiness. If she had not misunderstood when she saw Katherine Jackson come out of Hadwin's mansion and instead believed that Hadwin loved her or asked him for clarification, would they not have separated?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina came to Stephenson Group's entrance, she suddenly stopped. She was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She saw a few figures coming out from inside, and the one leading them was... Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Dressed in a suit and tie, he was now thinner than she remembered. His black hair was slicked back, revealing his full forehead and fully exposing his beautiful face. At the same time, it also made him look daunting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was emitting a solemn and intimidating aura. Lina stared blankly at Hadwin Stephenson. There was only him in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As if he had noticed her gaze, Hadwin Stephenson slightly turned his head and looked at Lina. The moment he saw her, his pupils shrank and he stopped in his tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ting..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had just spoken one word when Hadwin Stephenson continued walking away. He turned away and was no longer looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if she were just a stranger to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing Hadwin Stephenson about to get in a black car that was parked outside, Lina instantly came to her senses. She hurried forward and stretched out her hand to grab Hadwin Stephenson's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin!" she said quickly, trying to stop him from leaving so quickly. "Give me some time. I have something to say to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stopped and looked coldly at the hand that was grabbing his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The people behind Hadwin Stephenson were surprised to see this. Some had begun to speculate about Lina's identity. Of course, some also recognized Lina as the woman who had a scandal with their president. The news had made it into tabloids. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at Lina's face. Those dark eyes looked at her indifferently. "Who am I to give you time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah..." Lina froze. His indifferent eyes stung her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't like being grabbed by strangers. Let go." Even his voice was indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Strangers?' Lina just felt like a sharp sword was stabbing into her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She once said they had nothing more to do with each other!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she just realized how hurtful those words were when he said them!</p></div>
