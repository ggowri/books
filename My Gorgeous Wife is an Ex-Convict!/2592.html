        <h1>Chapter 2590</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, Martin Weiss said nothing and just chose to leave after doing so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Have I... let him down too many times that he chose to say nothing?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand slowly touched the place where her liver was. His liver was here. It was the liver he gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she might not have much longer to live, but... he extended her life again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What about me? Am I going to sign the divorce papers as if I don't know anything? Or...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla gently looked down at the thought of it. Her hands also clenched slightly as if she was making up her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She came to her mother's room and gently knocked on the door. "Are you asleep, Mom?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn opened the room door and saw that her daughter had something to say, so she said, "Come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla entered the room, took a deep breath, and said, "Mom, I&rsquo;d like to make a trip to L City, but Trista is still young and has just gotten out of the neonatal care unit. She can't make such a long trip, so I want Trista to stay here. Can you help take care of her? I won&rsquo;t take her with me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn did not seem surprised that her daughter would say that. "Okay, I'll look after the two children while you go to L City. But you're going there alone, and you just got a little better. You should take good care of your health. Bring the medicine the doctor prescribed for you and take them on time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's too much trouble for you to take care of two kids yourself. I'm thinking of hiring someone else to help with the housework and other things so that you can take it easy too," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hire someone? Why would you waste the money? I can do it all by myself. I'm old, but I'm not too old to do these things. It's not too much work. At most, I'll just close the store for a few days," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the store had to be restocked regularly. If business was busy, she might not be able to look after the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's close the store until I come back, then. But I still think it&rsquo;ll be better if we hire someone to do the chores..." said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I'll have my hands tied if there's a stranger in the house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the mother and daughter were arguing, a slightly childish voice suddenly rang out. "I can take care of Grandma and Tristas. I&rsquo;ll do the chores."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson, why are you..." Kyla looked at her son in surprise. She thought her son had fallen asleep. She had planned to talk to her son about going to L City after discussing it with her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, I&rsquo;ll do the chores after coming home from school every day. I&rsquo;ll also help Grandma to take care of Tristas. Don't worry, I'm not a child anymore. I'm a big brother," Nelson Corbyn spoke like a little adult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her son's behavior. He was still a child, but he had to carry burdens he should not carry at his age!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She owed the child so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you hear what we said?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn nodded. "I know you&rsquo;re going to look for Daddy. aunt Cummins told me today that Daddy had donated his liver to Mommy a second time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out Nelson already knew. Kyla hesitated slightly and said, "Yes, I'm going to see Daddy. You..." She was worried about her son's reaction. After all, his son had always disliked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although things were better now, she was not sure whether her son accepted Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... don't hate Daddy, and I think Daddy is brave to have donated his liver to you for the second time," said Nelson Corbyn.</p></div>
