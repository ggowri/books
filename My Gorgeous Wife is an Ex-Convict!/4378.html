        <h1>Chapter 4376 The Choice</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell was taken aback. He had indeed forgotten about Harley's mother's past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, everyone around him belonged to prestigious and wealthy families. He had grown up in such an environment, and all his friends were from similar backgrounds. So much so, that he sometimes forgot that there were always exceptions in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If what I said earlier upset you, I apologize," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was somewhat surprised. After all, the Lornell she knew wasn't someone who would apologize easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I still hope you won't give people like Calvert a chance. I don't want to see you get hurt," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Harley couldn't help but inwardly mock herself, considering that the person who had hurt her the most was Lornell himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to avoid any awkwardness, Harley said, "I'll be careful, but Calvert is my friend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, there was a sudden commotion at the spot below where they were originally filming. A few people, who seemed to be onlookers, tried to rush towards the model, but they were stopped by the staff on site, turning the scene into a bit of a chaotic mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley frowned, what on earth was going on?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately wanted to rush out of the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go!" Lornell abruptly pulled Harley back. "If you go now and someone recognizes you, you'll probably end up in the news again, and become the subject of all sorts of rumors and gossip!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley pursed her lips, "Even so, I want to go and make sure. As for what happens next, I'll handle it myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she quickly left the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell stared at his empty </span><span>palm,</span><span> the sudden loss of warmth made him feel as if something was missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't take the photo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the look of obvious worry and anxiety on her face just now because she was concerned about Calvert?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so worried that she even forgot why she came to see him today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange emotion was slowly spreading in Lornell's chest. But he couldn&rsquo;t tell what this feeling was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell picked up the photo, his face darkening as he looked at the intimate couple depicted in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he had to wait for another opportunity to give the photo to Harley!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley rushed to the scene as fast as she could. The place was already in chaos, with a large number of fans gathered around. Some fans were stirring up trouble, and despite the efforts of the staff to maintain order, they were simply unable to control the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley caught sight of a staff member and approached, saying, "Take me to Calvert and the director."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" The staff member was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Harley," she declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that circle, everyone knew Harley!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, the staff escorted Harley into the temporary partition room designated for filming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The director, two models, and some other crew members were all in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was quite surprised when they saw Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Hart, what brings you here?" the director asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just happened to be nearby and saw some friends filming here. Then trouble broke out, so I came to check it out," Harley said, her gaze landing on Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his hair was soaking wet, and there was a distinct red mark on his cheek as if he'd been slapped!</span></p></div>
