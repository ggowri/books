        <h1>Chapter 1833</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I'll go with you," said Jason as the car headed for Emerald City&rsquo;s airport.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they reached the airport, Grace met Hadwin Stephenson in the VIP lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was in a black trench coat, and next to him was a black suitcase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're leaving Emerald City?" asked Grace as she panted. After finding out he was in the VIP lounge, she and Jay ran over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Can't I leave Emerald City?" Hadwin Stephenson looked at Grace indifferently and said, "I came to Emerald City for business. Now that it's done, I'm going home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace quickly asked, "What about Lina? Do you know that Lina is still lying in the hospital bed&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So what?" he interrupted coldly. "What does it matter to me what's going on with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." Grace immediately stepped forward and raised her hand to slap Hadwin Stephenson's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A loud slap rang out in the VIP lounge. Fortunately, it was a small separate room and no one else was there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked coldly at Grace, exuding a dangerous aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason quickly pulled Grace aside, afraid that Hadwin Stephenson would harm her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, I&rsquo;ll fight with you if you want!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson sneered, raised his hand to touch the cheek that was slapped. "Jason, what's the matter? Your wife slapped me in the face. Not only won't you apologize, but you&rsquo;re also going to bully me like this? Do you really think I'm afraid to lay a hand on you just because Emerald City is your territory?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I told you, I'll fight you if you want!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two men confronted each other, and the atmosphere seemed like it would explode at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "Hadwin Stephenson, I did slap you in the face, but I think one slap isn't enough! Lina was miserable enough when you broke up with her. Five years later, you messed with her again. Lina is lying in the hospital, but you&rsquo;re here planning to leave? What on earth does Lina mean to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson softly spat out the words, "What's the matter? Are you trying to get justice for Lina? Listen to me, Lina is the one who doesn't want me. She's the one who's trying to distance herself from me. She doesn't trust me at all! I'm just leaving her life as she requested!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What happened between you two? Why did she suddenly change her attitude when she was planning to get back together with you? Did you two argue?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson froze a little. 'Lina was planning to get back together with me?' However, he soon laughed at himself. Lina had spoken to him so resolutely. There was no use dwelling on the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said coldly, "Grace, I don't have to tell you that. What happened between Lina and me is none of your business! I can forget about the slap today, but that doesn't mean you can do it again. If you do it again, I won't let you off easily even though you're the mistress of the Reed family!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Hadwin Stephenson dragged his suitcase and left the VIP lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly and turned to look at Jason. "Was I too impulsive just now? I just wanted to find out what happened, but..."</p></div>
