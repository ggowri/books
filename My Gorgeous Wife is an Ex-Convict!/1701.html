        <h1>Chapter 1699</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she opened her eyes, there was still panic in them. Upon seeing Jason's face in front of her, for a moment, she felt as if a lifetime had passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay... Jay..." There was a quiver in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He said, "It's me. I'm sorry I hurt you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked at him blankly. Perhaps today's events had caused her to dream of her falling into the sea. It was at this moment that she realized it was just a dream. Five years had passed since she fell into the sea, but she still found it surreal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Am I really back? Have I really come back to his side?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She shuddered as she reached out her hand, trying to touch his face. However, she stopped in mid-air and was afraid to touch him. It was as if she was scared that everything was just an illusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyelashes quivered a little. He raised his hand and grabbed Grace's hand, pressing her palm against his cheek. "What's wrong? Did you have a bad dream?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She drew a long breath, and a wry smile appeared on her lips. "Yes, I had... a bad dream."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It haunted her like a nightmare, and she would have preferred not to remember it if she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What kind of dream was it?" he asked as he brushed her palm against his cheek. His dark eyes were staring at her the whole time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her body stiffened as her eyes flickered with guilt. She looked down and said, "I forgot. It just... felt like a bad dream."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she brought it up, she would only trigger him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" he whispered. He could see that she was guilty and lying. 'Does she know her hands go cold when she lies?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Your hands are a little cold."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are... Are they?" She tried to pull them back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her hands were still clasped in his, and he rubbed her hands against his palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let me warm you up." He looked down as he spoke, huffing at her hands gently as he rubbed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The night was cold, and her cold hands gradually warmed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, are you really willing to stay with me?" His voice rang out abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was stunned for a moment before saying, "Of course, I am!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's good." He looked down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He only hoped she was sincere, and what she had said in her dream about not forgiving him... 'What won&rsquo;t she forgive me for?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did she never forgive me five years ago? Has she never forgiven me for knowing who the real perpetrator is but being indifferent to her imprisonment? Even tacitly allowing others to hurt her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What happened in the end?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And when can I remember it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The incident with Irene Lynch and Oriel Lynch came to an end. Grace went to see Kyla with Lina, and the three women got together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's a good thing that your name was cleared on the spot, or God knows what would have happened," said Lina. She learned about it from the videos online afterward.</p></div>
