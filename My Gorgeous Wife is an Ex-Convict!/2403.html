        <h1>Chapter 2401</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow, who was not far away, also witnessed this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a smile on his thin lips, Philip Barlow swayed the wine glass in his hand with a half-smile. It seemed that there would be drama in Deer City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the party, Brian said to Grace, "Where do you live now? I'll send you back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace rejected and said, "No thanks. If you send me back and someone takes a photo of us, there&rsquo;ll be a lot of rumors.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes gazed at the person in front of him. "Are you afraid that Jason will misunderstand you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She met his eyes and replied gently, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke so straightforwardly and frankly. She did it so openly and naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had a faint feeling of jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had told himself many times that he had no right to be jealous because he was the one who missed his chance. He did not grasp it when he had it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he loves you and trusts you, he won't misunderstand," murmured Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't care if he&rsquo;ll misunderstand, but at the very least, I don't want to do something that will cause him to misunderstand," said Grace as she looked into Brian's deep phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He still looked at her with longing and love. She knew he had not moved on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe some things would take time to move on from. It was obvious that it had not been long enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a car had slowly driven up to Grace. The driver got down and greeted Grace respectfully before opening the door to the backseat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the car that Grace had arranged to pick her up. The driver had stopped nearby. He drove over when he saw Grace walking out of the party venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said to Brian, "Goodbye, Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" Brian suddenly shouted as he reached out his hand to stop her. "Were you trying to get close to Whitney Herrera tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze and looked at Brian in surprise. She did not expect him to be so perceptive that he could see that Whitney Herrera was her goal tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Brian saw Grace's expression, he knew he was right. "I don't care why you want to get close to Whitney Herrera, but I can be your stepping stone and help you get to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Grace was in a trance when Brian looked past her and toward another direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed his gaze and saw Whitney Herrera and Daley Moss coming out of the party venue. They saw her and Brian and were walking toward them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, I hope I can have a chance to talk with you more about the new project you&rsquo;re starting. My husband and I are interested in it," said Whitney Herrera as she walked forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled indifferently, "Alright. Grace is a fan of your past films, Miss Potter. I hope we can talk when we have the time. I think Grace will be elated if you're making a comeback, Miss Potter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Whitney Herrera's gaze fell on Grace.</p></div>
