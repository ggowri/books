        <h1>Chapter 3223</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, I remember now. The guy earlier, his name was Brian, right? Isn't his wife the one with a slight limp in her leg? It must be him. He also mentioned that his last name is Hart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, the prince of the entertainment industry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the people around finally reacted and some of them started searching for Brian's related pictures online to confirm if the man with the surname Hart they just saw was really the entertainment industry's young master.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, someone in the crowd murmured, "I... believe in love again. Oh my god, the prince must truly love his wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Valda got her beloved limited edition comic, she and Brian didn't really go around the anime convention much. After all, they had already gone around most of it before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you were competing, did you purposely make mistakes in some of the events because you calculated your score beforehand?" Valda asked as they walked outside the anime exhibition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Brian replied. "You wanted a third place prize, so there was no need to get high scores."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda found it unbelievable that he was manipulating the scores of the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, how did you almost answer all the questions correctly during the quiz?" Valda was also very curious about this, as he was not part of their circle and yet he was able to answer so many questions correctly, with only two questions left unanswered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because I've seen a lot of them, so I can naturally answer them," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've seen a lot of them?" She was stunned. "Have you seen all the anime, manga, and books about anime production related to those questions?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he continued to give her a positive answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She widened her eyes, looking extremely shocked. "When? When did you see all of those?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"During the year you disappeared, I had nothing to do, so I watched them all," he said casually, but her eyes suddenly turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could he have had nothing to do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had heard from Camille that during her disappearance, he was in a state of complete despair, neither human nor ghost-like, and even Camille thought that if they couldn't find her, he might commit suicide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What kind of emotions did he have when he was looking at these anime-related things back then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why... do we have to watch those..." she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because it's something you like, when I look at them, it's like I'm keeping you company while you watch," he said, raising his hand and gently stroking her reddened eyes. "Okay, don't cry. I won the prize for you today because I wanted you to be happy, not because I wanted you to cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I'm touched, not uncomfortable," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them walked out of the anime convention, and Valda felt a little thirsty. So Brian said, "Wait here for a moment, I'll go buy some water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she replied. Outside the exhibition hall, there were many benches along the tree-lined path where people could rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sat on the chair and lightly massaged her calf through her long skirt with one hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although rehabilitation has greatly reduced the degree to which she limps while walking, her legs still cannot handle walking for long distances. If she walks too much, it easily causes soreness and slight pain.</p></div>
