        <h1>Chapter 2888</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you! It's a good painting, and I like it very much. I didn't expect you to draw my daughter like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I saw the baby when I came to the hospital that day, so I remembered," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard from Jay that you and Brian both came to the hospital that day. I didn't scare you, did I?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled softly, "All that matters is that you're safe. Being alive is better than anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two women chatted while the two men looked at each other. Then, Jason said, "Brian, let's go get some air."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men got up and walked out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked uneasily at the ward door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "They&rsquo;ll be back soon. Don't worry. My Jay won't kidnap Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled, knowing that Jason probably had not told Grace about what happened that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, how are you and Brian's relationship? Does he treat you well?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He treats me well." It was true. He treated her well. He would give her everything she wanted these days, except letting her leave the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was making up for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "That's good. Brian might look cold, but he's responsible. He loves you and will only treat you better in the future. And I think he's not as indifferent as he used to be when you're around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more Grace spoke, the more bitter Valda Theller felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She forced herself to put a smile on her face. Then, she tried hard to steer the conversation to the baby as subtly as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's attention was diverted at the mention of her newborn daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outside the ward, Jason looked at Brian and asked, "What's going on between you and Valda Theller?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pressed her thin lips tightly, not wanting to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not interested in whether things are good or bad between you two. But since you&rsquo;ve chosen to pretend like nothing has happened and keep everything as it is in front of Grace today, don't let Grace find out that she's the reason for the conflict between you two," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know that. I won't let Grace find out about this," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had had someone delete Valda's videos at the comic fiesta online to prevent Grace from seeing them. That way, Grace would not beat herself up over it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all his fault!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller's good. She's better than I expected," Jason said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know she's good," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's just too kind that she's a little foolish. She and Grace have different characters. Why did you choose her?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His phoenix eyes looked down as Brian murmured, "Maybe it's because she's foolish." She was unlike any other woman he had met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But sometimes the more foolish the person, the harder it is to manipulate them," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian understood what Jason was trying to say. You could make a deal with interests and money with a smart person, but a foolish person was stubborn and only accepted facts.</p></div>
