        <h1>Chapter 1111</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a wry smile after Brian left. Her phone was still with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had taken her phone when she was locked up in the mansion, and she never saw it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that she would have to report that she lost her phone card and get a replacement as well as a new phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It did not cost much to get a replacement card, but a new phone... She heard a knock at the door as she was thinking about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Brian come back?' Grace stood up and opened the door to her rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to her surprise, it was Terrence at the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Miss Cummins. Here's your phone. Master Reed asked me to return it to you," said Terrence as he handed Grace her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the phone, and Terrence left without saying anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned on her phone once she was back in the house. It still had some battery left. She saw a lot of missed calls that were mostly from Lina and some from the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace called Lina back to let her know that she was safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was so flustered when she received a phone call from her best friend. "Did you... get away from Jason? Are you okay? Where did Jason take you? Did he do anything to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt her best friend's concern from the series of questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied, "He didn't do anything to me. Besides, I don't think he'll do anything to me anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean?" Lina was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's probably over between us," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Lina was a little hesitant to speak. Her best friend's voice was calm, but there seemed to be something else in it. "Are you sure you're okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine. Alright, I just called to let you know I'm back in the rental house and something like this probably won't happen again. My phone is dying, so I'm going to hang up now," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call, she checked her phone again. It was the same as it was before Jason took it. Actually, the only difference was that a photo had been deleted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A photo of... Jason as a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had seen his childhood photo album before they broke up and took a photo of him as a child with her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the breakup, she deleted his phone number but the photo remained on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The deleted photo was Jason telling her that they had nothing to do with each other anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was alright. It signified a clean break and no more entanglements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end&hellip; the man who called her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; and said he loved her had become a part of her memory&hellip; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed at herself as she looked down at her feet blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not that she was not touched and never thought about getting back together when he knelt in front of her and kissed her instep as he made the oath.</p></div>
