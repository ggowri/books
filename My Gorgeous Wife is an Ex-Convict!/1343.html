        <h1>Chapter 1342</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn finally sighed. She looked at Grace and said, "Yeah, I have stage three liver cancer. I probably have only half a year left. Although the doctor said chemotherapy might add two years to my life, I don't want to spend what&rsquo;s left of my life doing chemotherapy. I want to spend the last six months on my own terms!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Although she had a bad feeling when she saw the medications, she had no idea that Kyla Corbyn's illness would be so serious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... about surgery? What did the doctor say?" she asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It wouldn't make much of a difference unless I get a liver transplant, but because of my special blood type, I can&rsquo;t find a matching liver. We can forget about a liver transplant," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn said a little hesitantly, "I've thought about it. There&rsquo;s still a chance! Didn't you donate your bone marrow to someone before? The doctor said they're only a few years older than you and have the same blood type as you. Why don't we try to find that person? Maybe they're... willing to donate their liver to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, even if the donor donated part of their liver, the rest of their liver was enough to support their body&rsquo;s needs and would slowly grow again in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "Mom, stop it. It's been so long ago. Besides, hospitals have their regulations. They cannot disclose the name of their patients! Furthermore, I didn't expect anything in return when I donated my bone marrow. How can I go and ask them to cut a piece of their liver for me now? Isn&rsquo;t this just emotional blackmail?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, the surgery also has risks. If they donate their liver to me, that person will have to undergo another risky surgery. A liver donation has a much bigger risk than bone marrow donation. They are a few years older than me, so they must have a family and kids. It's like asking their entire family to risk their lives for me," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace listened to what the mother and daughter were talking about, her expression changed as if she had thought of something. "Kyla, you&rsquo;ve... donated your bone marrow before too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was years ago," Kyla Corbyn said lightly, not noticing Grace's use of the word &lsquo;too&rsquo;. "I registered in the bone marrow bank when I was younger. Who would have thought that not long after, someone called and asked me if I would like to donate? They said that someone with a unique blood type happened to match mine. So I donated, thinking I&rsquo;d be saving a life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned. 'Kyla and Paisley Daniels both donated their bone marrow. Is this a coincidence? Or is some of the truth being hidden? Maybe I should look into it more carefully.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, you need to get treatment for it no matter what. If you're worried about money, I can help you with that!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, thank you. I know what's going on with my illness. I'll cherish every day that follows," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that the best way was to find a suitable liver and have Kyla Corbyn undergo a liver transplant. Now, she wanted to find out whether Kyla Corbyn's bone marrow donation back then had anything to do with Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe... there would be another turn of events! If... it was as she had suspected...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving Kyla Corbyn's house, the driver drove Grace to the hospital where she was going to have her routine-check up for her pregnancy. Jason was already waiting there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Grace saw Jason, her eyes could not help turning red. She immediately walked over with her arms wide open and wrapped them around Jason's waist. Then, she buried her face deep in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" asked Jason as he lowered his head and looked at the person in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's nose felt sore. "Kyla... only has half a year left to live. If she doesn't find a suitable liver within six months, she'll..." She started sobbing.</p></div>
