        <h1>Chapter 2912</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there any nonsense? The people present will naturally have a measure in their hearts!" Raymond Bowman explained how Barbara Schuman had taken advantage of his liking for her to get him to approach Valda Theller, and then accused Valda Theller of shamelessness afterwards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hidden truths of the past were now being revealed by Raymond Bowman in this manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Raymond Bowman in shock. This man was not only dragging Barbara Schuman down, but also himself, by speaking in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should have been aware of the impact on his own reputation after saying these things, but he still spoke out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't... don't say anything, Raymond Bowman, please stop!" Barbara Schuman panicked and tried to stop Raymond Bowman from continuing, but her attempts were futile. Raymond Bowman continued to speak and revealed everything that had happened in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people around them began to look at Barbara Schuman with different eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After everything had been said, Raymond Bowman suddenly felt a sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps this matter had been weighing on his heart for too many years. Now, he finally had the courage to speak out, just to protect the person he wanted to protect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved her, wanted to protect her, and wanted to prevent her from being hurt again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Valda Theller, Raymond Bowman said, "Valda Theller, I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since they reunited, he had said sorry to her many times, but none of them were as heavy as this one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finally spoke after a while, "Everything is in the past now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After speaking, she turned around and was about to leave. At this moment, Barbara Schuman suddenly said, "What do you mean? I just wanted to help you two get together, but you deliberately threw dirt on me. That's too much!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she threw the red wine in her hand towards Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller instinctively tried to dodge, while Raymond Bowman instinctively tried to block the wine for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, someone else was faster and held Valda Theller in their arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a gasp from the people around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller recognized the familiar scent and knew who was holding her, even without looking up.</p></div>
