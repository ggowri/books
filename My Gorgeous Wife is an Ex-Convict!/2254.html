        <h1>Chapter 2252</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes fell on his son again as he said, "Let's go... then, Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn looked at Martin Weiss. He hesitated for a moment before calling him &lsquo;Daddy.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it was only one word, it made Martin Weiss smile. His eyes also seemed to be brimming with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should be content. Nelson was finally willing to call him &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo; after the mistakes he made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes glimmered a little when she saw that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three of them arrived at Nelson's school. As it was parent-child day, the school was bustling with parents accompanying their children to their respective classes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each class had a theme for the parent-child event. For example, some were doing haunted houses, where students and their parents would dress up as ghosts and monsters. There would also be some sound effects as well as light and shadow effects to add to the atmosphere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a class with a secret escape room and one with a Hansel and Gretel theme, where students would gift each other snacks and candies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson's class had a time-traveling beverage store that sold all sorts of drinks. The money to buy the drinks was taken from the class fee, and the drinks were bought from Kyla's store at their cost price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Prices were then set for the different drinks. The students and parents would serve the drinks together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a parent who was in charge of the extras' costumes in a film studio, so they had a lot of costumes on hand that could be lent for a day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the students picked out different costumes from different eras according to their preferences. Seeing children and adults walking in the classroom that was set up like a beverage store while wearing those costumes, one would be confused as to what era one was in. It made it rather interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to the student ID number, parents and students worked as waiters at different time slots. Each time slot was about half an hour long. After that, they were free to roam the school grounds. They could buy food and drinks from other classes or play some games.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In conclusion, the school's parent-child event was held like a carnival to encourage interaction between parents and their children. It could also strengthen the parent-child bond and improve their interactions with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson's student ID number was at the top of the list, so Kyla and Martin Weiss were among the first batch to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were eight parents and five students in this slot. Thirteen of them were going to work as waiters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They began choosing the props and costumes that they liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some classmates whispered to Nelson Corbyn, "Nelson Corbyn, your parents are both here today. Your daddy's so handsome! He's just like what the girls said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss previously announced their marriage at the store&rsquo;s entrance after getting their marriage certificate, so some students in Nelson's class had seen Martin Weiss before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some girls even voted Martin Weiss as the class's &lsquo;most handsome father&rsquo; in private.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn replied shyly, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He somehow felt like he was being praised as well when his classmates praised his father's good looks. Besides, whenever there was a parent-teacher meeting, sports day, or the like, his mother was usually the only one with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a lie to say that he did not envy the students who had both their parents accompanying them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the time, he never expected his father to participate in school activities with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his wish had come true today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many students in the class only had one parent with them today, but he had both parents with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn felt nothing but joy in his heart. He even felt motivated to work as a waiter later.</p></div>
