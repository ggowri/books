        <h1>Chapter 3024</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it's a bit inappropriate for children and can make one feel embarrassed and excited while watching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was stunned when she heard about how to increase the chances of getting pregnant for both men and women, as well as what to do afterwards to ensure a successful pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She really didn't know that there were so many details to consider when preparing for pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a voice suddenly sounded in her ear, "So, you really want to get pregnant, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was startled, then turned her head. Suddenly, a handsome face appeared before her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... that's not it. Camille sent it to me, and I just casually looked at it," she quickly explained. However, her flushed cheeks and stuttering voice made her words less convincing at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I understand," he said with a smile on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It really was from Camille," she said, raising her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I understand," he continued with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why does she feel like things are getting worse and worse?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Camille spoke up to her online, "How about it? I'm pretty thoughtful, right? I went to great lengths to find these things just to help you achieve your goal. You have to make sure Brian works hard. If he doesn't, you can use your beauty and power to seduce him and make him fall for you over and over again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda is extremely upset, because Brian is right next to her now! Camille's words have made Brian aware of the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And, what about beauty and strength, does she have any of those?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed to be quite interested, "It looks like those messages you received earlier were indeed sent by Camille."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes...yes," Valda awkwardly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She told me to work hard, but you can rest assured that I won't disobey. Of course, if you want to seduce me, I can also cooperate," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's head was almost hitting the desk. Oh my god, he... wasn't he supposed to have a cold and indifferent personality? When did he start making jokes all the time?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda quickly closed the chat box, fearing that her friend might send something shocking. Then, she awkwardly said to Brian, "Don't mind her, Camille was just joking with me. She didn't know you were reading the messages."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pitch-black phoenix eyes gazed at her, "But what if I don't consider this as nonsense?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked her eyes, what does he mean by that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, if I seriously wanted a child with you, would you be willing?" he asked in a low, seductive voice that seemed to have an invisible power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, she only felt that his gaze and his voice were like a net, tightly trapping her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She didn't want to break free, nor did she wish to break free!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she heard her own voice saying, "I do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, she is willing to have a child with him because she loves him and wants to spend the rest of her life with him. She also wants to have a child that belongs to both of them, a continuation of their lives together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of this... is so natural, it just falls into place...</p></div>
