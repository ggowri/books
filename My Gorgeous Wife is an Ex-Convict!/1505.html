        <h1>Chapter 1503</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence softly pushed the room door open and looked at Jason who was in the room. The man with the highest authority in Emerald City was currently lying on the ground in such an embarrassing state. His hands were clenching the clothes that Grace used to wear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The floor was scattered with Grace's photos that showed her at different stages in her life. There were photos of her from her adolescent days till her adulthood. She was smiling brightly in each of the photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the sweeter the smile was in the photo, the more it made others feel heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed&hellip;" Terrence softly spoke, "The group still needs your leadership. There are a few upcoming projects that you need to approve as well. If you continue being like this, then&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Still no news on Grace?" His hoarse voice interrupted Terrence with a mutter. However, he still did not open his eyes and they remained shut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if at that moment, he was hugging the person he loved most. He could even smell Grace&rsquo;s scent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was not willing to wake up from this fantasy. If he was awakened, only endless sufferings awaited him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No&hellip;" said Terrence. It had already been more than 40 days, and the search party had put it bluntly when they said that her corpse was probably eaten by large fishes in the sea. They were no longer able to locate her corpse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was just that Terrence dared not tell his boss that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was afraid the moment he said it, Young master Reed would really go crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, please tell me, where are you?" Jason hugged the clothes in his hands tighter. His face was almost buried in those clothes. "You said that you want me to live. But if I can't find you, there won't be any meaning for me to continue living. How am I supposed to keep living..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wake up, Young master Reed! If Young Madam can really see all of this in heaven and she sees you in such a state, it&rsquo;ll only make her sad," Terrence could not help but say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his statement had triggered Jason. The next second, Terrence was petrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because Jason's eyes that were initially closed were now open and glaring straight at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In his dark eyes, bloodlust glinted as the man gave off a murderous aura!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What do you mean she&rsquo;s in heaven? She's not even dead yet. She's not dead, do you hear me?!" Jason abruptly got up and immediately beat Terrence to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His five fingers grasped Terrence's neck. His stance was as if he was about to kill someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is Young master Reed&hellip; trying to kill me?!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A thought flashed through Terrence's mind, and deep in his heart, he was feeling utterly regretful. He should have known that currently, Young master Reed was not in his right mind and could not tolerate any more surprising news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He should not have said anything about Grace being in heaven earlier. 'By saying that, I was basically saying that Grace is dead. It&rsquo;d be surprising if Young master Reed could take it.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, he wanted to say something to make up for it but his neck was being grasped so tightly that he was unable to say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence thought he would be the most wronged person in this world if he ended up being choked to death like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, Young master Reed's strength became surprisingly powerful. Terrence&hellip; was unable to free himself from Young master Reed's grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that instant, a baby's cry was suddenly heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's body stiffened. 'Who&hellip; Who's crying there&hellip;' His stiffened fingers loosened up. He turned around to look behind only to see that the butler was carrying a baby with a helpless expression. He was standing at the door of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"This baby..." Jason looked at the crying baby with a blank look.</p></div>
