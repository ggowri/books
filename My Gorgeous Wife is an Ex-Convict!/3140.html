        <h1>Chapter 3138</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian!" she said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just that she's not worried for herself, but for someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It'll be okay in a moment, very soon!" he said, then walked straight towards Tracy and the other two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These three people looked at Brian walking towards them, and their hearts were filled with joy again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's your name?" Brian asked Tracy with a cold expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy is currently feeling both scared and happy. She is scared because of the look in the other person's eyes, but happy because this is an opportunity for her to get closer to Brian and advance her position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the other person has asked for her name, she can now talk to him more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My name is Tracy. My father is Finley Barlow, the chairman of Barlow Group. I have always admired you, Brian, which is why I chose to enter the entertainment industry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Barlow family?" Brian murmured softly. The next moment, he raised his hand and slapped Tracy directly across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This slap was very forceful, causing Tracy to stagger and blood to appear at the corner of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If there wasn't someone supporting her beside, she would have fallen directly to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy looked shocked, covering her slapped cheek. "Brian..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda is my fianc&eacute;e, she has never lied to me. Who are you to call her a fraud?!" Brian's gaze was cold as he spoke. "To me, she is my everything. Anyone who troubles or harasses her is also troubling and harassing me. The Barlow family, I will remember this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying these words, Brian stopped looking at Tracy and turned around to Valda's side. "Let's go!" he said, then immediately bent down and picked her up horizontally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" Valda exclaimed softly and instinctively wrapped her arms around Brian's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He walked quickly and in no time, he had already picked her up and carried her outside. He carefully placed her on the seat inside the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry for making you feel wronged," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda shook her head and said, "It's not that you made me feel wronged, and I know that when you said those words in the end, it wasn't just for Tracy to make things difficult for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was clearly speaking to everyone and letting those who heard him know that she was not to be messed with. Anyone who dared to harm her would pay the price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, whoever hurt you, I will make them pay a thousand times over," murmured Brian. He took Valda's hand and looked at the red swelling on the back of her right hand. He lowered his head and kissed her hand gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt a warm sensation on the back of her hand, not a painful heat, but the warmth of his lips. It kept passing through her skin and spreading throughout her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Make her feel like her body is getting hotter and hotter...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt a bit embarrassed and moved her wrist to pull her hand out of his, "Um... let's go back." She lowered her head and spoke softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at his empty palm and then at Valda, who had been keeping her head down. After a while, he said, "Okay, let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car slowly drove towards Valda's apartment, and all the way there, Valda kept her head down and remained silent.</p></div>
