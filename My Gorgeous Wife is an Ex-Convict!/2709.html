        <h1>Chapter 2707</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she still looked older. She was older than when she met Martin Weiss ten years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Let's do what we did back then!' she said to herself. Then, she smiled at herself in the mirror as if she was cheering herself up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must spend the day well because it would become a wonderful memory in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Walking out of the room, she saw Martin Weiss already in the dining room. Besides Martin Weiss, Shana Nicholls was also here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls already knew that Martin Weiss would spend the entire day with Kyla. However, Martin Weiss did not explain the specific reason to her. He only asked her to give him the medicine he needed that day and let her take the day off. He did not need her to take care of him today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Kyla walk over, Shana Nicholls reluctantly took out Martin Weiss's medicines and told her the dosage and time to take them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla memorized them one by one before saying to Shana Nicholls, "Nurse Ruan, you can leave the mansion now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls bit her lip slightly and glanced at Martin Weiss. Seeing that Martin Weiss had nothing to say, she reluctantly left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Martin Weiss and said, "Let's have breakfast first. After that, you&rsquo;ll take your medicine and we'll go out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said nothing to her and just told the servant to serve breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servant looked surprised to see their master having breakfast with the mistress but dared not ask any questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Breakfast was served. Kyla and Martin Weiss ate it together. Martin Weiss took a glimpse of Kyla out of the corners of his eyes. She seemed a little different than usual today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because she let her hair down?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was the first to finish her breakfast. Martin Weiss was still eating when she finished, so she looked at him and told him today's itinerary. "We're going to Moon Lake later. We'll have lunch somewhere around there before watching a movie. After the movie, we'll go shopping at the mall nearby and come home for dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's it?" He narrowed his eyes. He was surprised that the itinerary she arranged was... much simpler than he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like a normal couple's day out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled and said, "Yes, that's it. Of course, I&rsquo;ll stay with you until midnight after we get home. You'll be free once the clock strikes 12."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He found the word &lsquo;free&rsquo; somewhat irritating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Martin Weiss took his breakfast and medicine, Kyla and Martin Weiss left the mansion for Moon Lake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They often came to Moon Lake back when they were dating. Moon Lake was also a famous spot among many lovers, so it was nicknamed Lover's Lake in L City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were indeed many couples at Moon Lake. Kyla and Martin Weiss got out of the car and walked down the boulevard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly reached out and took Martin Weiss's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened instantly. "What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Holding your hand. Before we got married, we used to hold hands when we came here, didn't we? Since we're married now, isn't it natural for us to hold hands? Today, I want us to be a regular married couple," Kyla said slowly.</p></div>
