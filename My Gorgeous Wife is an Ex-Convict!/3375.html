        <h1>Chapter 3373</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And his lips continued to move, opening and closing as he said, "The only person you can choose is me. Do you understand what I'm saying, Tina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina nodded vigorously and said, "Understood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really understand?" He was now 15 years old and old enough to understand the meaning of marriage, but she was only 8 years old. Could she really understand? He doubted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, in the future, I can only marry Chandler and become his bride. I can't marry any other guy, right?" she said. "But I don't want to marry anyone else either. I like you the most, Chandler. I just want to be your bride."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said happily that her previous gloom had vanished completely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So when she grows up, she can become Chandler's bride, that's really great!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another dessert was eliminated. Tina thought for a moment and put on a serious expression as she said to Chandler, "Chandler, I will study hard in the future, strive for progress every day, be a good student, and in the future, be a good wife and mother! I will also have many, many good babies, so you cannot change your mind and marry another bride!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler looked at Tina in a daze as she spoke these words seriously in front of him. Is she afraid that he might change his mind?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You made a promise with my dad and mom, remember? As our teacher taught us, we should have the spirit of keeping our promises. Once we make a commitment, we cannot go back on our word," Tina continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then those shiny black eyes stared straight at Chandler, as if waiting for his response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler chuckled softly, lifted his hand and gently wiped the dessert off the corner of her lips. "Okay, I won't go back on my word, Tina. I'll wait for you to grow up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From a long time ago, he has been waiting for the day when she grows up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the same weekend, on the other side, Brian and Valda went to the amusement park with their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley is in high spirits today, having already played several popular activities this morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During lunchtime, they ate at the restaurant inside the park. However, they didn't choose the fancy private rooms, but instead opted to dine in the main hall like an ordinary family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and her daughter found an empty table to sit at, while Brian went to queue up to order food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda couldn't help but smile as she watched her husband's back disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, she has been studying various etiquette and learning how to speak in different situations to make herself look more like a wealthy wife for Brian. She accompanies him to some banquets and important occasions, striving not to embarrass him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she knew he wouldn't mind and would protect her even if she really embarrassed herself, she still wanted to do her best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Brian was also trying hard for her, being more like an ordinary person. They would eat at street stalls and go shopping at small vendors, as if they were an ordinary couple. They would browse through old bookstores in alleys and streets. When they visited their godmother Lisa, Brian would accompany her for a walk around the neighborhood and take their daughter to play with other children in the park.</p></div>
