        <h1>Chapter 1426</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many people online called her nasty names, and even the hospital staff gave her strange glances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels could only think of getting out of the hospital first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she was mobbed by a group of reporters the second she walked out of the hospital after going through the hospital discharge procedure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Daniels, what do you think of the video they played on the streets?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What was Mr. Weiss's reaction? Will your wedding go on as scheduled?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Was the baby you miscarried Mr. Weiss's or the man on the video?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did you deliberately frame Ms. Kyla Corbyn to make it appear that she caused you to miscarry the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The barrage of tough questions made Paisley Daniels look extremely grim, and the flashing lights embarrassed her even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Stop it! Stop it!" Paisley Daniels blocked the cameras with her hands, while Mr. Daniels, Mrs. Daniels, and some of the subordinates they brought with them helped hold off the reporters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the group finally got into the car, Paisley Daniels gritted her teeth in hatred. "Kyla Corbyn will pay for this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If it were not for Kyla Corbyn, how could she have ended up in such a situation?! It was all because of Kyla Corbyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let's leave Emerald City for a while. We'll take our time and plan this out when this issue settles down after some time!" said Mr. Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car headed for the Emerald City freeway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, halfway through their journey, several cars suddenly came out of nowhere and surrounded the Daniels family's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Someone got down from the car, and all three members of the Daniels family immediately stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Martin Weiss who stopped their car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, their car door opened and everyone inside was quickly subdued by Martin Weiss's men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wen... Martin, what are you doing?" Paisley Daniels's heart trembled with fear. She only found Martin Weiss's face so gloomy at the moment that he seemed to be tinged with a killing rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Daniels snapped, "Martin Weiss, what are you doing? Do you know you're breaking the law by doing this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Breaking the law?" Martin Weiss suddenly sneered and walked up to the three members of the Daniels family, step by step. He snapped, "How dare you accuse me of breaking the law in front of me? Do you know you're the real criminals? How could you... How could you have done that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For a moment, his eyes were full of intense anger and hatred.</p></div>
