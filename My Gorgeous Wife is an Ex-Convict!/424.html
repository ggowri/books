        <h1>Chapter 423</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she was able to follow the conversation, she became even more embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Consequently, Jason responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Oh. What&rsquo;s going on between you two, Jay? Are you lovers?&rdquo; Foreigners were known to be more straightforward with their way of phrasing things. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were any other domestic employee, they would not have dared to ask Jason such a question in such a direct manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Grace heard Jason respond in English, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the person I love the most.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In an instant, Grace felt as if her heart had been clenched tightly by an invisible hand. Not only that, but her heartbeats became stagnated. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the video conference was over, Jason walked toward Grace. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, why are you blushing?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No&hellip; It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Grace quickly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, Jason held onto Grace as he persistently looked at her blushing face. &ldquo;Is it because of the words those people said earlier?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not respond, but it seemed to be the case anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Next time, I&rsquo;ll take the opportunity to introduce you to them,&rdquo; Jason said. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Introduce?&rdquo; Grace exclaimed out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. &ldquo;Why? You don&rsquo;t want me to?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Uh&hellip; It was more like she felt taken aback by the matter. At this moment, Jason&rsquo;s passionate gaze seemed to glare out a sense of oppression. It was as if Grace would be set on fire like a fuse if she refused to do what he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought it over and said, &ldquo;I just think that we started dating recently, and they&rsquo;re the senior executives of your company who are overseas. Isn&rsquo;t it a bit too early&hellip; for you to introduce me to them?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; Jason&rsquo;s thin lips showed a smile, and his fingers stroked her blushing face. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s going a tad slow. But, Sis, if you think it&rsquo;s a bit too fast, then I&rsquo;ll wait until you&rsquo;re ready to be introduced to them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace heard his words and finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then&hellip; then you should put your hands down for now so that you can have your meal,&rdquo; Grace replied as he had not stopped touching her face throughout the entire ordeal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want to let go. You face is soft, and I like touching it,&rdquo; Jason muttered, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if the longer I touch it, the more addictive it gets.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless. &lsquo;Is that considered a compliment?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ultimately, Jason refused to let go. He only put his hand down after a while longer. Grace was then finally able to eat as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had prepared three dishes along with soup for the day&rsquo;s lunch. They were all usual home-cooked dishes. However, because of the guidance Grace received from the chef of the Reed Residence, the dishes turned out to look extraordinarily better than take-out meals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Did you make these, Sis?&rdquo; Jason was slightly surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yeah, but your house&rsquo;s chef was there to guide me,&rdquo; Grace added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Jason took a bite, Grace looked at him expectantly and asked, &ldquo;How is it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good.&rdquo; Jason replied with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But, they&rsquo;re still not as good as your chef&rsquo;s, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No, I prefer the ones you made,&rdquo; Jason replied, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you make, I&rsquo;ll like them more.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; merely sweet talk, right?&rsquo; Grace thought to herself. At this moment, her mobile phone rang, and Grace looked at the caller ID. It was a call from Kyla Corbyn, thus Grace answered it.</p></div>
