        <h1>Chapter 2926</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Valda Theller returned to the table, but Camille Strickland was nowhere to be seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was this woman who took Camille!" Valda Theller exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shortly after, the bar's surveillance footage showed the woman taking Camille Strickland to a car parked outside the bar and driving away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the license plate of the car was clearly visible in the footage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart took out his phone and dialed the number of tMason Swansonty's traffic department, asking them to check the surveillance along the route to find the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller waited nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry," Brian Hart reassured her softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But that woman deliberately knocked out Camille and took her away. It's obvious that she has bad intentions. Where is she taking Camille? Could it be a kidnapping?" Valda Theller began to speculate about various possibilities in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If the other party is really kidnapping for ransom, then no matter how much money it takes, I can pay it. Valda Theller, I will definitely help you save your friend," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the man in front of her, feeling a bit stunned. She bit her lip and said, "Thank you..." She had rejected him before and was worried that he would refuse when she called him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But he appeared in front of her without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she could rely on herself and not on him, but when something happened, all she could think of was asking him for help!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller despised herself in her heart, but at the same time, she was grateful that she had found Brian Hart. In such a short time, he had uncovered the truth about her friend's disappearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, the others in the surveillance room looked at Brian Hart in surprise. They couldn't believe that this legendary figure could be so gentle with an ordinary-looking woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Didn't they say that Brian Hart was as cold as ice and hadn't had a woman by his side for many years?</p></div>
