        <h1>Chapter 3328</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a gift for the newborn, she used her own savings to buy a small gold charm to bless the child with safety and longevity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the item Lisa presented was not worth much money, Valda still cherished it greatly. To her, it was a strong expression of Lisa's emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa also gave Valda a big red envelope for good luck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The money inside was all saved up by Lisa, and Valda felt grateful in her heart. "Godmother, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You, just being able to safely give birth to the child is good enough. I'll go back to the church later to say a prayer and thank God for his blessings," said Lisa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's go worship together," said Mrs. Hart, the elderly woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Old Mr. Hart also agreed, "Yes, let's go together to pay our respects and fulfill our wishes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, the relatives of the Hart family, including their friends Mr. and Mrs. Hart, as well as Brian and Valda's own friends, gradually learned about the birth of their daughter. They came to the hospital to congratulate the Hart family on their new little princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's hospital room is quite lively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the VIP ward is spacious and divided into two rooms. The inner room is where Valda rests, while the outer room is for visitors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, although many people come to visit, it is not too noisy for Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, because the child needs to drink milk every 2-3 hours, Valda's sleep is not good. Sometimes she is extremely tired, but still has to feed the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, there are specialized caregivers and nannies, so Valda feels much more relaxed compared to ordinary mothers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian has become a 24-hour personal caregiver, rarely leaving Valda's side unless necessary. Even at night, he sleeps on a cot next to Valda's hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And every time Valda feeds the baby, Brian also wakes up to keep her company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt sorry for Brian as she looked at his clearly exhausted face. "Actually, once you fall asleep, you don't need to wake up specifically to keep me company. When I feed the baby, there are caregivers and nannies around, so there won't be any problems."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She just wants him to be able to sleep a little longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm worried, if I can keep an eye on things, I'll feel more at ease," said Brian. "Besides, you just had a baby and you're going through so much, how can I sleep soundly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While speaking, Brian took Valda's hand and said, "When you were giving birth, I watched you in pain, but I couldn't take that pain away from you. I felt so powerless at that time. I couldn't feel your pain, but at least I hope I can share your hardship and experience it together with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda stared at the man in front of her, who always managed to break down her defenses without even trying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her godmother and mother-in-law repeatedly reminded her not to cry during her postpartum confinement, she couldn't help but feel her eyes welling up with tears at this moment. She felt as though the tears were about to spill out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He saw her red eyes and the watery layer in her eyes, and quickly said, "Don't cry. I didn't say these things to make you cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why did you still make me feel so touched?" she complained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, it's my fault," he said, gently kissing her fingertips.</p></div>
