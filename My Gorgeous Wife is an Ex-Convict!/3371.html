        <h1>Chapter 3369</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of person are you?!" exclaimed Lonny in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person didn't speak, they just looked at Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler spoke to Lonny in a calm tone, "I told you, we need Vice President Gary from Lazy Cat Culture to come over here." He then took out his phone and dialed a number. "This is Chandler. Can you ask Vice President Gary from Lazy Cat Culture to come to the Sleeping Cat Exhibition Hall in Emerald City? He should be in Emerald City right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the call ended, the person on the other end of the phone stared at their phone with a look of disbelief on their face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sleeping Cat Exhibition Hall? What's that all about?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lonny, Laura, and the on-site staff are all looking at Chandler with surprise on their faces. However, the way they are looking at him makes it seem like they are looking at a fool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lonny said, "Young people who try to show off their wealth should also consider the appropriate occasion!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff spoke to Chandler, "Sir, please do not cause trouble here. Otherwise, I will have to call security."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler lowered his head and said to Tina, "We have to wait here for a little while. If you're bored, I can have someone accompany you to other places to stroll around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina shook her head and said, "Chandler, what if this set of stamps is really reserved for them? What will we do if we can't buy it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you really like it, then just have them remake the stamp set," said Chandler, as if he was talking about something as simple as that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff on the side were amused, "Reproduction? Do you know what reproduction represents? We have to start a new production line. Is it worth all the trouble just for your desire to have a seal? This is a limited edition, once it's sold out, it's gone..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler ignored the staff member's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, unlike others who don't believe, Tina believes. She knows that whatever Chandler says, he can definitely make it happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff attempted to hand over the seal to Lonny again, but Chandler's subordinates once again blocked them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing the situation, the staff immediately made an internal call and said, "Send a few people over here, there are people causing trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Laura heard this, she sneered at Tina and said, "Soon, you will be kicked out! How pathetic!" Tomorrow, she will definitely go to class and tell her classmates about this, so that more people can mock Tina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lonny remained silent, pursing his lips. He knew that if he mentioned the name of the White Maple Group, the staff would be too afraid to ask the security guards to remove them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But since the other person didn't say anything, why bother bringing it up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, it's like watching a good show. He can just stand by and watch. If he ends up embarrassing himself, it's not just his own embarrassment, but also the embarrassment of the White Maple Group. If the boss finds out, he might even be pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, several security guards in event uniforms quickly walked over. The staff pointed at Chandler, about to have the guards escort Chandler and Tina out of the venue. Suddenly, a voice rang out, "Wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff looked up, but suddenly froze in shock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person running over was none other than Vice President Gary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you come, Vice President Gary?" the staff asked in surprise.</p></div>
