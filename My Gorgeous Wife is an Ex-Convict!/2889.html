        <h1>Chapter 2887</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He and Phoebe Cross were not even friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to explain this to me," said Valda Theller. They had broken up, and she did not need these explanations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she knew better than anyone that he had always been in love with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of Grace, Valda Theller said, "I want to go to the hospital to see Grace. Can I?" The last time she visited Grace, Grace was still unconscious, so she wanted to check on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hesitation flashed across Brian's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry. I won't say anything to trigger Grace. I&rsquo;ll still pretend to be your girlfriend in front of Grace. If Grace asks you, you can say we're doing quite well. When Grace has recovered, I can make an excuse to say we've broken up. Of course, I can take all the blame. For example, I thought being with you attracted too much attention, or I couldn&rsquo;t get used to being with you, or I had fallen for someone else&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish speaking, she was suddenly pulled into a wide embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands held her tightly as his husky voice muttered in her ear, "Valda... I'm the one who's at fault. It's me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She still had his and Grace's best interests at heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know her kindness makes me feel bad?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why haven't I fallen in love with her yet? I want to fall for her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt the urge to cry as she longed for the warm embrace, but she once again told herself not to long for his embrace because the consequence might make her a different person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you just can't fall for me. And it's no one's fault."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was her fault for meeting him so late, and he was too loyal!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Valda Theller, accompanied by Brian, went to the hospital and met Grace, who was still lying in the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had woken up, but she did not look well and even looked weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sat by the hospital bed, peeling an apple for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Emerald City's famous Young master Reed gently cut a slice and feed it to his wife, Valda Theller was envious of their affection for each other. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every woman wanted to be gently treated by their loved ones and be together forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, how are you?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ve been feeling much better in the last two days. Don't worry. It's already a lot better than I thought." Grace smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had to recuperate for a long time, she thought it was worth it in exchange for a little life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is... a longevity charm that Brian and I bought for the baby. We wish the baby safety," she said as she handed the gift to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was the one who bought it, but saying they had bought it together sounded more natural.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And this..." said Valda Theller as she took out a painting, which was not big. It was only the size of an A4 paper. "I painted it for you. I hope you like it".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked and found that the figure in the painting was herself holding a baby as she lay in a field of flowers. In the painting, she was looking at the baby gently while the baby was cooing, looking healthy and strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The whole painting was soft and loving, making her and the baby seem alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The baby... looked like the one in the photo Jay had shown her.</p></div>
