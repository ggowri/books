        <h1>Chapter 454</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the local tyrant of Emerald City wanted to help someone reverse a case, it was sure to be a success!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Grace was innocent! Whoever was behind it was sure to be found out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina, relieved from her gloom, brightened up. "It's almost noon. Let's have lunch together." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded, and the four of them walked out of the detention center before getting into their car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was busy going through the list of recommended food in S City and found several restaurants to try. Then, she asked Grace to choose one. The two men had no objections, so Hadwin drove up to the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a local specialty restaurant here in S City, and it had a long-established reputation. Four of them got out of the car and asked for a private room before they started ordering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Lina did most of the ordering, but she based her orders on the recommendations she read online. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Lina had ordered by referring to her phone, she looked at the 20 or so dishes. There were only four of them, so she embarrassedly said, "It seems we&rsquo;ve ordered a little too much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can order anything you like. We rarely come here, so we might as well try more of this place&rsquo;s specialties," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was immediately at ease again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, while waiting for the dishes to be served, Lina held her phone and showed Grace the various posters of The King's Lover, the TV series she recommended earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think? Isn't Howell Webb's costume manly, seductive, and sexy?" Lina said with some excitement</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's face darkened right away. This woman who watched TV dramas and chased after idols all day long obviously forgot that he was her boyfriend now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Worst of all, she presented herself to him as if she were always looking at him with fascination. In the next moment, however, she was again fascinated by all kinds of idols and celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace could see the posters, the phone was taken away by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason peered down at the posters on her phone, swiping to see more of them. After a while, he looked up and stared at Grace. "Is this your ideal type?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went into a frenzy of embarrassment. "Well... I... I had high hopes for this actor. His acting is good, and some of the TV series he starred in were also pretty good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Fine, how about I ask my secretary to ask Howell Webb out some other day, so you can have a good look and ask for an autograph or something?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes widened with admiration on her face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Oh my God! Was Jason going to help Grace meet her idol? Lina was impressed. It was just too badass! With Jason's abilities, no matter which celebrity Grace was a fan of, Jason could ask them out. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin looked at Lina and his face seemed a lot more gloomy. Did this woman... need to show her envy so visibly on her face?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was just a celebrity. Was he that good? It was just a meeting to get his signature. Could she really be that envious?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the waiter came in with the dishes, breaking the eerie atmosphere in the private room.</p></div>
