        <h1>Chapter 892</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she regretted it a little. 'I was drunk, so I can't remember exactly how we did the deed. It looks like I have to try a little harder and have another memorable time with him.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, as if remembering something, she cried out, "Ah, where's Grace? Wasn't I with Grace yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was annoyed when she mentioned this. "So you remember you were with Grace? What did you tell me yesterday? You said you had to work on a project. Then what happened? You took Grace to a place like that to watch a show."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina winced guiltily. "I just wanted to help Grace blow off some steam and not get sick. I did work on my project during the day. That's why... I only went to Grace in the afternoon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about the clothes you grabbed? I've never seen you grab my clothes, yet you would grab some stranger's clothes.&rdquo; He snapped, but his movements were gentle and careful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I got it... for Grace!" Lina immediately used Grace as an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Well, um, I did say I was going to give it to my best friend.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, yes. Where's the vest?" She remembered suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I threw it away," Hadwin said as he curled his lips, 'Am I going to save it for the new year if I don't throw it away now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked and said with a distressed expression on her face, "Why did you throw it away? Do you know that if I sell it online, I could at least earn 2,000 to 3,000 dollars from it?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart ached at the loss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that all? I'll give you the money later!" He rolled his eyes at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you give me the money, that means I didn't earn it. It's much more satisfying when you spend the money you earn! Hey, rub a little harder. A little more to the left... Yes, there it is. Rub a little more. It feels good here," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was getting pissed off by this girl!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the one questioning her at first, but she ended up commanding him instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you send Grace home yesterday? Was she drunk too?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She was drunk, but it wasn't me who sent her home. It was Jason," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was surprised and instantly widened her eyes before turning to look at Hadwin. "Jason? He went to the bar too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, he even saw you two dancing and singing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What was he doing there? Didn't he break up with Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you go and ask him that?" Hadwin raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was rendered speechless. After considering the way Jason behaved, Lina thought it would be better to ask Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she remembered one thing and quickly picked up her phone that was left on the bedside, ready to make a call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm making a call. I didn't go home all night. My parents should be worried." She could imagine her parents lecturing her for a long while after going home today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've already told your parents. They won't worry anymore," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What?' Lina blinked before reacting. "You told them... I was staying at your place for the night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You tell me," he replied, raising his eyebrows.</p></div>
