        <h1>Chapter 404</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want the small restaurant that Kyla worked so hard to run to be messed up by these people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was the so-called &lsquo;sense of justice&rsquo; in her body that had begun to rise again. After all, did she not become a lawyer in the hope that justice could be served?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was done talking, the men's faces took on a ghastly expression. Then, one of them looked around, looking apprehensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was about to leave, one of them suddenly grabbed Grace by the arm, trying to stop her from leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man pulled so hard that Grace dropped her phone, making it fall to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone saw her phone screen in the recording interface and cried with a ghastly expression, "She's recording, Boss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"F*ck. How dare you pull such a stunt?" One of them became so enraged that he raised his hand to hit Grace, forgetting that he was out in the open with the cast's fans around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, there was a cry of surprise all around. Grace closed her eyes subconsciously and raised her hand in an attempt to block his falling hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the cries of surprise seemed to change a little. There were gasps and exclamations, but Grace did not feel pain. Instead, she felt a hand on her shoulder, drawing her toward a slightly cold embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened her eyes and saw a handsome face with sharp edges. However, the man&rsquo;s usually indifferent face was now a little angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What&rsquo;s going on?" Brian's voice was horribly cold as he grabbed the hand that was about to hit Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man's forehead broke out in a cold sweat. He was feeling as if his hand was about to break. However, what frightened him more than the pain in his hand was the man in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was&hellip; the crown prince of the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the scene before him, could it be that... the crown prince was trying to help the delivery girl?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The others who were with the man quickly stepped forward and said, "She's just a delivery girl, Master Hart. There was a bug in their food. We just got desperate and&hellip; Uh, it's no big deal, no big deal." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All these people wanted to do now was to get it over with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian lowered his eyes to look at Grace and asked, "Are you all right?" There was a hint of rare tenderness and concern in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "I'm all right, thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had it not been for Brian, she would have really lost out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked down at the phone that had fallen to the ground and was about to bend down to pick it up before Brian picked it up first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this yours?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she answered, taking her phone from his hand and checking it roughly. Luckily, it did not break, and the screen did not crack either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other crewmates&rsquo; eyes were wide with shock when they watched Brian bend down to pick up Grace's phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since when did&hellip; Master Hart help people pick up things on the ground?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if something had fallen to the ground, there should be someone else to pick it up, right?</p></div>
