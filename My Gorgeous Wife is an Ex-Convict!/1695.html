        <h1>Chapter 1693</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just when the words were about to escape her throat, a figure emerged from the bathroom not far away. It was Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch only saw Jason looking toward Grace, and those eyes that were filled with chills and malice before were replaced with endless tenderness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The man did not care about the Reed family's reputation. Was Grace the only one he cared about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch's heart suddenly sank, and the policewoman accompanying her yelled, "Hurry up! Don't delay our time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch resumed walking again while Grace headed over. The resentment in Irene Lynch's heart grew as she watched Grace get closer and closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I'm in this situation now because of Grace. If it hadn't been for Grace... If she didn't...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as they passed each other, Irene Lynch crashed into Grace with all her strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ah!" Grace was caught off guard by the collision. The window in that hallway was open and it was right next to Grace. Due to the impact, she was thrown sideways and out of the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was so desperate to knock Grace out of the window that even the policewoman could not stop her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt as though her feet were already in the air. She tried to hold on to something and stabilize herself but it was to no avail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her upper body was now out of the window and she could even see the blue sky and white clouds outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Am I... going to fall and die?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that instance, the image of her sitting in the car recurred to her. The car seemed to be leaning back while she looked at the sky through the windshield...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She felt reluctant but also determined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She mumbled the same name... "Jay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, a hand seized her wrist and pulled her back through the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Thump! She crashed into a wide embrace, and the familiar scent immediately calmed her panicked heart down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'This is... '</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay!" she cried out in a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, are you okay?" Jason asked anxiously. His heart almost stopped after what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could hardly imagine what would have happened if he were too late and missed her wrist. She would have fallen. Was he going to lose her then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His heart ached at the thought! The pain felt familiar. It was as if he had been... in such pain before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm alright," said Grace after gasping a little. She felt his hands holding her so tightly that it was as though he wanted to meld himself to her. His embrace was so tight that she could feel him trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if... he were the one who was about to fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm fine. I'm fine." She raised her hands, wrapped them around his waist, and patted him on the back. She was now the one comforting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you really... alright?" It took him a long time before he finally loosened his arms a little. His dark eyes were looking at her with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah." She nodded and found his eyes a little misty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch had already been taken down by the policewoman, who said apologetically, "Mr. Reed, Mrs. Reed, sorry to have startled you..."</p></div>
