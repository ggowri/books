        <h1>Chapter 465</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no one in the room answered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned and went straight into his room, then into hers through the door that connected their rooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was dark in her room. The window was shaded by the curtains, and the lights were not turned on. He could only see through the dim daylight that filtered through the curtain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this did not affect his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked around the room and soon saw Grace in a corner. Her body was curled up while her arms were folded around her knees. Her face was buried in between her knees as if she was trying to curl herself into a shrimp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He remembered that he had seen her in a corner in the same posture once before...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he felt as if his heart had been pricked by something. The video he saw earlier replayed again and again in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the video, she was slapped in the face before being dragged out of the mall. Even though it was hard to hear what they were saying in the video because of the distance, he could sort of guess what the Atkinson family had said to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flash of anger in his black eyes. It was directed at the Atkinson family and himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should have warned the Atkinson family not to harm her! That way, she would not have been so humiliated today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis..." he crouched down slowly and called out to her softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remained in the same position&mdash;motionless as if frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis..." The volume of his voice rose slightly. "No matter what happens, I'll always be here for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body suddenly shivered. Her shoulders dropped a little, and she slowly raised her head. Her face was pale, her almond-shaped eyes were red, and her pink lips beneath her nose had distinct teeth marks where he could imagine how hard she had been biting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you cry?" he asked while his long fingers slowly brushed past her red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body stiffened, and she seemed to be trying hard to force out a smile from the corners of her mouth. "I... didn't cry. I... I'm just a little tired, so I&rsquo;m resting against the wall for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared deeply at the woman in front of him. Did she know how bad her lies were? The smile she tried hard to fake seemed to sting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know all about it. Don't ever force yourself to smile like that in front of me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he wanted to see was her happy smile, not the smile that would make his heart ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason picked Grace up as he spoke, carefully holding her in his arms as he walked over to the sofa. Then, he sat her down on the sofa and examined her hands and feet as well as her skin that was exposed. He saw that there were no other injuries except the bruising on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, however, was taken aback by what he said. He knew all about it? "What do you know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know what happened to you today. Someone took a video of the incident and posted it online," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body immediately stiffened, and she bit her lower lip again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she had mentally prepared herself to accept the embarrassment and not dwell on it, the thought of the humiliation being recorded and posted online seemed to magnify it an infinite number of times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did she have to suffer all this? She had done nothing wrong, so why was she still suffering from the consequences?!</p></div>
