        <h1>Chapter 715</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not feel any pain as all his attention was on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, let go so I can take you to the hospital," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Let go? No, I can't let go, because&hellip;' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I won't let go. I... I'll take you up there. You must hold on to me..." Grace said these words almost unconsciously while in the throes of the pain in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian heard these words, his body became rigid suddenly. For a split second, his blood seemed to stop flowing. He even stopped breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'These words... These words are&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes stared at the person in front of him, and his face moved closer to hers as he tried to listen more closely to the vague mumbles coming out from her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why would she say that? Only &lsquo;she&rsquo; would know this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice rang out. "Brian, what are you trying to do to my fianc&eacute;e?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Grace's body was swept into the arms of another man, but her hand was still holding Brian's hand firmly. She would not let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared gloomily at her clenched hand, then looked down on Grace's pale and agonized face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, what's come over you?" The gloom on his face turned to worry. "Is your head hurting again? Don't worry, you'll be alright soon. You'll be alright soon..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His clear and elegant voice rang in her ear. He wrapped his arms around her and held her head against his chest as if he was coaxing a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When had Young Master Reed ever coaxed someone like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Grace could make him do that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... Jay! It's Jason calling me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though her head was still hurting and she seemed to have become a little dazed, Grace still managed to open her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her lashes quivered a little as her almond-shaped eyes opened slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace caught sight of Jason's anxious face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have a bad headache?" Jason asked hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me... Rest a little..." she murmured as if leaning against him would make her headache better. "Jason, talk to me again... Alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to hear his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together, then began to talk about what food they were having tonight, what the scenery was like, and the recent state of the international economy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In short, he said whatever came to mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His clear voice was like a pair of gentle hands, suppressing her headache little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stood beside them, his phoenix eyes still fixed on Grace. The three of them formed a strange stance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Grace finally felt as if her headache had eased, and she looked a little better now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Has your headache eased?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," answered Grace. Her mind, dazed by the pain, was slowly recovering. Her almond-shaped eyes contracted suddenly at the sight of Brian beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly remembered that she was talking to Brian just before she got a headache. Then as she was about to fall, her hand grabbed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes moved to her right hand, which was still holding Brian's wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt awkward for a moment and immediately let go. "Sorry, I only did that out of sheer desperation."</p></div>
