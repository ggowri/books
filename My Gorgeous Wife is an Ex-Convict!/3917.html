        <h1>Chapter 3915</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing this, Clarissa immediately stood in front of Nancy and said, "Where do you think you're going? You were so pleased with yourself after watching the play yesterday. Who do you think you are? Do you really think Mick would be interested in you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was about to retort, but seeing the worried look on her mother's face, she swallowed her words and said, "I didn't watch any play, and Mick and I have no relationship. Can I leave now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, her words were obviously useless. Clarissa didn't move aside and said, "If there's no relationship, then why did Mick speak up for you? Nancy, do you really think you're a Miss of the Schultz family just because your mother married into it? You're just a dog of our Schultz family. Do you think Mick would be interested in a dog?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The merciless insult made Nancy's eyes turn cold. "Clarissa, I never thought of becoming a Miss of the Schultz family. I don't know if Mick likes me, but at least I know he won't like you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This sentence obviously provoked Clarissa. She raised her hand and slapped Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy took the slap head-on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, she could have dodged, but she didn't choose to. She knew that if she dodged, her mother would be the one to take the hit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shouldn't have impulsively retorted just now. Maybe if she had endured it, it would have passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after the slap, Clarissa became even more ruthless. She directly slapped Nancy several times and even kicked her to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The feeling of pain spread throughout her body, but Nancy told herself to endure it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she didn't endure it, then her mother would have to endure the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eileen saw this scene and could only plead with Clarissa, "Clarissa... please don't hit Nancy anymore. Whatever she did wrong, I'll make her compensate you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what if I want to hit her? Since she's a dog, she should recognize her own identity!" Clarissa said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa, no matter what, Nancy is your sister without blood relation. How can you say she is... is a dog..." Eileen couldn't bear to see her own daughter being insulted like this and wanted to argue for her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to Clarissa, this sounded like adding fuel to the fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa turned to Eileen and said hatefully, "If you hadn't insisted on entering the Schultz family, how could I have become sisters with your daughter? Let me tell you, you are just parasites of the Schultz family! Your daughter is the dog of the Schultz family, and so are you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eileen trembled all over. "How can you say that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why can't I say that? I can do whatever I want. Even if I hit you, my dad won't say anything!" Clarissa raised her hand and was about to slap her stepmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before her hand could touch Eileen, it was intercepted by Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop!" Nancy stopped Clarissa and said, "You can hit me, but don't hit my mom. No matter what, she is still your stepmother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stepmother? I don't even know what kind of fox charm your mom used to seduce my dad! You and your mother should have been kicked out of the Schultz family long ago!" Clarissa insisted on hitting Eileen with an imposing manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In order to protect her mother, Nancy stood in front of her and took the hit from Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even so, Clarissa still felt it wasn't enough. She dragged Nancy to the balcony and pinched her neck with both hands, as if she wanted to strangle her to death!</p></div>
