        <h1>Chapter 246</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Most of the people there did not hear what Jason said to the director. They just watched Jason walking toward the extras. Everyone on the set could not help but start discussing and guessing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several female extras were shocked into some kind of ecstasy when they saw Jason approaching them. They immediately put on what they thought was their most alluring smiles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In particular, Sabrina Briggs longed for a chance to plunge herself directly into Jason's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her mind, she was even wondering if she was going to pretend to faint, or if she was going to stumble and bump into Jason so that they could talk. That way, she could make friends with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, that man was Jason&mdash;the man who ruled Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Jason was interested in her, even if she could only be a secret lover, it was still what many women dreamt of. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Jason had never been close to women. His only fianc&eacute;e died in a car accident more than three years ago. If she did manage to seduce Jason, she might finally have a chance to marry into a wealthy family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had always been confident about her appearance and figure, but she felt that she had no connections. She was turned down in all her previous auditions, so she could only start as an extra.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sabrina Briggs kept coming up with all kinds of little thoughts. Seeing Jason getting closer and closer, she immediately shook herself. She intended to fall into his arms as Jason approached her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would probably look just like in the movies and TV series, right? Did the female lead and the male lead not begin their romance that way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, Jason stopped. Then, Sabrina Briggs could only watch Jason ask Grace, who stood not far away from her, with a smile, "I just happen to have some time today, so I came to see you. How about we all go back together when you're done with filming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sabrina Briggs's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other extras around Grace also looked on in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the extras did not know who Jason was, but if they looked at his posture and the way he dressed up, they could guess that he was a young master from a rich family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip a little, feeling rather uncomfortable now that everyone around her was looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt like she was being observed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't like me being here?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... a little too attention-grabbing," she whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't you take a little attention? I don't know how you became a lawyer. Don&rsquo;t a lot of people look at you during court trials," Jason quipped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes dimmed. Before her imprisonment, she had had no fear of people's gaze and could talk fluently with a thousand eyes upon her, but now she was afraid of being noticed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was not for paying off her grandmother's medical bills as soon as possible, she would not have chosen to be an extra.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason seemed to realize that Grace was bowing her head, looking very sad. He did not go on about it but raised his hand and gently patted Grace's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Oh my God! He&rsquo;s patting her head!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sabrina Briggs's eyes were goggling. What was the relationship between Grace and Jason?! Jason&hellip; was stroking Grace's head so tenderly.</p></div>
