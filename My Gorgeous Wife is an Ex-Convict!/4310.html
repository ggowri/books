        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Harley responded, then left the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell looked at Tina and said, "Tina, what do you want to talk to me about? Let me make it clear, I cannot break the rules of the Quentin family. Besides, we don't really have any relationship between us, do we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the indifferent face of Lornell. She had heard her father comment about the Quentin family before, saying that they were all cold-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because the Quentin family members were already accustomed to life and death, and they were all absorbed in improving their medical skills, which made them even more ruthless than ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Quentin family, studying medicine has never been about helping others, but merely about pursuing the pinnacle of medical knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it comes to saving lives, the Quentin family doesn't save just anyone; they only choose to save those they want to save.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if a patient is pitiful and begs desperately, the Quentin family won't be moved an inch if they don't want to save them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why it was so rare for Lornell to take the initiative to save Harley's life at such a young age, especially for someone from the Quentin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Tina think that maybe Lornell wasn't as heartless as the Quentin family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Tina said, "You know about the Chandler curse, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Lornell replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you know how to break the curse of the insect?" Tina asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Lornell was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his expression, she knew that he probably didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The parasites in Chandler's body will find people they are attracted to. Of course, that person is not specific and may not even be encountered in a lifetime. But if they do meet, the parasites in Chandler's body will react, and at that time, it will be known who that person is," Tina explained. "Back then, when my mother was pregnant with me, Chandler met my mother and sensed that she was the person who could cure the parasites. So when my mother had a difficult childbirth, the Hunter family intervened and arranged for me to be engaged to Chandler."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Lornell's usually indifferent face, a rare expression of shock appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you have an engagement because of the parasites?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what is the method to cure the parasites?" he stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tell you the method to remove the curse, and even provide support after I remove the curse from Chandler, to facilitate the Quentin family's research. But you must allow me to enter the Quentin family and help me remove the curse from Chandler," Tina laid out her conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell listened to the conditions Tina proposed and found them quite unexpected. He hadn't thought that Tina would propose such conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can let you enter the Quentin family, but if you can remove the curse, why do you need my help?" Lornell asked in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of embarrassment flashed across Tina's face. "To remove the curse, I need to give birth to a child with him and use the umbilical cord blood and placenta. The Quentin family should have good means to ensure a successful pregnancy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell raised an eyebrow. Was she asking the Quentin family for help in ensuring a successful pregnancy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And also..." Tina's expression became even more embarrassed. "Having a child is something that requires two people to accomplish. If Chandler is not willing, you have to help me </span><span>convince him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?" Lornell frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You Quentin family must have some kind of drug to make Chandler have a sexual relationship with me. But it has to be guaranteed that using that kind of drug won't have any effect on the child when I get pregnant," Tina said.</span></p></div>
