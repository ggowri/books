        <h1>Chapter 1558</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace turned to leave as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had just turned around, barely taking a step, when her wrist was caught by another hand. After getting spun around, she was dragged to the bed with such force that her back hit the soft bed hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before she could get up, Jason was already leaning over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hands were at her sides while his face was very close to hers. His breath sprayed over her face, and there seemed to be an uncontrollable rage in his dark eyes. "What's the matter? You wanted to talk to me when I didn't want to talk to you. And now you're going to leave when I want to talk to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm just trying to calm you down," said Grace as she struggled to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his body leaned more closer to her, imprisoning her in his arms. She could not get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, let me get up first," Grace said with a frown. The two were extremely close together. The obvious anger emanating from the person in front of her gave her a sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm calm," said Jason. The tip of his nose almost touched hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The closer they got to each other, the more her scent enveloped him. It was as if she could easily charm him. 'What the hell is wrong with me? Why am I getting so angry over her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Do I care? Do I care about her past with Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't fall in love with Brian, you hear me?" His voice rang coldly as if it was a warning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She paused. "I've never fallen in love with him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So you're saying I'm the one you're in love with?" he crooned softly, his face showing no emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes." She met his eyes without avoiding them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if I don't love you, will you always love me and never love anyone ,She was stunned. 'He doesn't love...' It was the second time today that she heard him say he did not love her. It still hurt to hear it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This man had once knelt before her, saying he would give her everything and all his feelings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You'll fall in love with me," Grace said with a somewhat sore nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason asked in reply with some amusement, "Why do you think so? Because I once loved you? Or is it like what you told our daughter, that I love you to death?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She stared blankly at him in silence. After some time, she said, "Would you believe me if I told you that you loved me enough to give anything for me? Even your own life. You were even willing to break all your rules and lay down your pride for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her as his thin lips pressed into a straight line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace laughed at herself. She knew he did not believe her. After all, he probably did not have much affection for her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She raised her hands and put them on his chest, trying to push him away so that he would get up. "Alright, I've said what I need to say. It's up to you whether you believe it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before she could finish speaking, his lips suddenly kissed hers. The next moment, Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He's... kissing me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The kiss was strong and overbearing with a vehemence that wanted to invade her. <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>It made her feel like she had nowhere to run.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was somewhat uncomfortable all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
