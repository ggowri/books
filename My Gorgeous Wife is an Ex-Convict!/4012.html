        <h1>Chapter 4010</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big Brother, let me accompany you back to your room," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I'm fine," Mick said, trying to push Jasper away, but he stumbled again and felt dizzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper once again supported his older brother and forcibly dragged him to the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Mick's bedroom, Jasper sat him down on the edge of the bed and said, "Big Brother, since you want to find Nancy, you should rest well now. Otherwise, what if you collapse before finding her? Nancy would be heartbroken if she saw you like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why didn't I believe her words back then? If I knew how serious she was when she said that, I would have told her not to do it!" Mick blamed himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Words?" Jasper was puzzled. "Do you mean the words under the wishing tree?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remembered that Nancy had mentioned something under the wishing tree before dragging Irene off the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, do you know what she said at that time?" Mick said with red eyes. "She said that if one day I needed her, she would repay me even if it meant going through fire and water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper gasped for breath!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did Nancy say these words to the eldest brother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Repay...haha, she really repaid me, but in this way. Why didn't she ask me if I wanted this kind of repayment?" Mick laughed wildly, but tears also welled up in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tears kept falling from his face, silently expressing his self-blame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper also felt self-blame in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for saving her, Nancy probably wouldn't have chosen to fall off the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big brother, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" Jasper kept apologizing. If she had been smarter or not resisted the bodyguards' protection, she wouldn't have been kidnapped by Irene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Nancy wouldn't have had an accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, I love her...I love her..." Mick murmured, "But I never told her until she fell off the cliff. No matter what she did to me before, I would forgive her. I don't care about the past, I just want her to be alive!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper shed tears, realizing that the eldest brother loved Nancy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she caused the eldest brother to lose the person he loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick choked, went crazy, and then, as if he had exhausted all his strength, fell into a deep sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, he hardly slept well, only two or three hours a day. As soon as he opened his eyes, he desperately searched for Nancy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at his elder brother and shed tears, then, as if he couldn't bear it anymore, covered his face and ran out of Mick's bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jasper ran downstairs, he was suddenly pulled by William and bumped into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you crying?" William asked with concern all over his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, he knew how much Jasper blamed himself, so whenever he had free time, he would come to the Reed family to see Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And at this moment, seeing Jasper's tear-stained face, he felt an immense sense of heartache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if we really can't find Nancy? William, why didn't I think of a better way at that time? If I had better eloquence and could persuade Irene, then... Nancy wouldn't have fallen off the cliff. Why am I so stupid?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper kept blaming himself.</p></div>
