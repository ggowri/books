        <h1>Chapter 1458</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe said indignantly, "You only broke a few fingers and spent three years in prison, but you're asking the Stevens family to pay with years of hard work!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had always looked down on Grace. Even though Grace was now the mistress of the Reed family, she still subconsciously regarded Grace as a regular citizen who was not good enough for the Stevens family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, a loud slap rang out before Grace could speak. Zoe was knocked off her feet and almost fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even one of her fingers is worth more than the entire Stevens family! Who is the Stevens family compared to my wife?" A cold male voice rang out. The way Jason looked at the Stevens siblings was ice-cold and spine-chilling, hitting them straight in the hearts!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe grabbed her cheek, shocked by the chill in Jason's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if she was only an ant in his eyes. She probably would not be able to speak again if she spoke one more word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe was terrified of Jason. No matter how good-looking he was, she felt nothing but fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She became silent and cowered behind Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean could only bite the bullet and say, "Master Reed, the Stevens family has always respected you. Please be the bigger person and spare us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason glanced lightly at Sean, saying, "But the Stevens family and the Atkinson family didn't spare my wife back then, so why should I spare you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's face turned red. "That... That was... all the Atkinson family's idea. The Stevens family is actually... innocent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How innocent are you? The Stevens family acquired many small and medium-sized enterprises in Emerald City with the Atkinson family's help. Your assets have at least doubled these years because of the Atkinson family&rsquo;s help. Sean, how dare you mention the word 'innocent'?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's sarcasm was like a hard slap in Sean's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said coldly, "The Stevens family will now pay whatever you took back then with interest. It seems that the Stevens family has put in a lot of effort to get you two here today, but... whoever helps you today is an enemy of the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's face immediately turned from red to white when Jason said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This not only meant that whoever helped the Stevens family today would suffer in the future, but it also served as a deterrent to the others!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If word got out, no one would dare to help the Stevens family anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was really trying to wipe out the Stevens family! The Stevens family was finished!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In a daze, Sean looked at Grace who was standing beside Jason. Who could have imagined that the woman he thought he could discard at any time... had now become the one who could determine the Stevens family's fate?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had not abandoned Grace that way and had been willing to find out the truth of the case for her, the Stevens family would not be reduced to such a situation now even if they got into some trouble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean was extremely regretful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, as if he had lost interest in the Stevens siblings, Jason turned to Grace and said, "Everything here is almost done. Let's go home and get a good rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Brian subconsciously stood in their way when they passed by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason frowned. "Brian, what's the matter? Do you really want to make a scene today?"</p></div>
