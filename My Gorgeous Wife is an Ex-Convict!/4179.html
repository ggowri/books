        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Finally, Mr. Perkins lost his patience and slapped Tina in the face, "Are you playing tricks on me?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Tina felt the pain on her face, but instead of crying out, she continued to stall for time, "How could I be playing tricks? My friend's life and my own are in your hands. Naturally, I want to stay alive. I'm seriously discussing with you, Mr. Perkins. Of course, if you release us now, I will be extremely grateful. In the future, I can persuade my dad and Chandler to cooperate with you, and then Mr. Perkins' position in Emerald City will be different..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Tina continued to make empty promises sincerely while feeling extremely anxious inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;She didn't know if this delay tactic was truly effective, and she didn't know if Chandler would discover the clues she left behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Just as Tina was running out of words, someone outside knocked on the door, "Boss, something happened outside, can you come out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Mr. Perkins frowned, "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;"Just now, Xiao Lu saw the news. The Hunter family and the Stephenson family didn't announce the cancellation of the wedding. The wedding is still going on. What's going on? Could it be that the person in front of me isn't Tina?" Mr. Perkins said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;"Well, boss, you should come out and see the live broadcast on TV!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Mr. Perkins immediately ordered his subordinate next to him, "You keep an eye on her. I'll go see the live broadcast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;The subordinate acknowledged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Mr. Perkins left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;But after a long time, he didn't come back, which made his subordinate uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;The subordinate held a gun against Tina and pushed her forward, walking all the way to the door, "Open the door!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Tina obediently complied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;When she opened the door and was pushed out, she saw the SWAT team standing right next to the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Tina immediately understood what had happened before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Chandler must have discovered the clues she left behind, so he called the police and they came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;However, Tina remained calm and continued to walk forward slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;At the moment the kidnapper with the gun walked out of the room with her, the SWAT team acted swiftly and decisively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;One person grabbed the hand of the kidnapper holding the gun, while another person quickly pointed a gun at the kidnapper's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;The kidnapper was subdued in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Tina breathed a sigh of relief. The kidnapping was resolved so quickly, she hadn't expected that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police entered the room and untied the bound Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia hugged Tina and cried, "Tina, why are you so foolish? How could you come here? What if something happened to you? What would we do if no one came to rescue us? Are you really planning to do what that maniac said?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, everything is fine now," Tina patted her friend's back to comfort her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Stephenson, your parents and Mr. Hunter are outside. When you go out, you'll be able to see them," the police told her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police were carrying out their mission and naturally couldn't let ordinary people enter the crime scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Chandler repeatedly hoped to accompany the police, he was still refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Tina replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After experiencing such an incident, she wanted to quickly see her parents and Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just then, Mr. Perkins, who was being escorted by the police, suddenly stared at Tina fiercely and laughed wildly, "Tina, you bitch, do you think you're saved? Haha, you'll die here with me!"</p></div>
