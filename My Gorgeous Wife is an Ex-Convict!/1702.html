        <h1>Chapter 1700</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was really pleased with how Irene Lynch and Damian Harmon ended up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"By the way, did Jason have an expert find that recording?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, Mick found it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mick?" Lina widened her eyes in surprise. "Are children nowadays so skilled?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla was also a little surprised, but because her son was intelligent and precocious as well, she was not as surprised as Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, he seems to be good with computers," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The three of them sat and chatted at the entrance of Kyla's store. Just then, out of the corners of her eyes, Grace caught a small figure walking toward the gate of the primary school nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace found the figure familiar. It was the little boy named Mason. After all, the boy had impressed her deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, to her surprise, the child was limping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Huh? Why are there no adults accompanying such a young child?" Lina could not help asking in confusion after seeing the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla then explained briefly to Lina about Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Poor kid. He's an adopted orphan but isn&rsquo;t welcome in his adopted family. He only has an older sister who&rsquo;s pretty nice to him, but she's young too and she lost her mother." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina thought that the family was chaotic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"People will think the siblings only have each other! Well, this boy got hurt the other day and can hardly walk, yet he still comes to wait for his sister at the school gate," Kyla said with a sigh. She sympathized with the child too, but it was someone else's family affairs, so she could not do much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He got hurt?" Grace froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah. I heard his sister and their stepmother had a conflict. The stepmother tried to beat up the sister but he stopped her and broke the cane. Their neighbors even called the police," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt a pinch in the heart. It stung a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They even used a cane. She could imagine how painful it was for the child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She immediately got up and went over to the little boy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hey, Grace..." Lina was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace has talked to the child before. She seems to care about him," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Speaking of which, Grace was pregnant with three children and one of them is still missing. I wonder how they&rsquo;re doing? Maybe it&rsquo;s because of empathy that she cares about this child," said Lina. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla said, "Maybe. If only Grace could find her child sooner. I wonder where that child is and how they&rsquo;re doing now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was a mother herself and knew how important a child was to a mother. She would probably be devastated if Nelson were separated from her one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We'll find them. If even a family like the Reed family can't find the child, I'm afraid there won't be many people in the world who can," Lina said optimistically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had now walked up to Mason. She approached him, but what she saw shocked her even more.</p></div>
