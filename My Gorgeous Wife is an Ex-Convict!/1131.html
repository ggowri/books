        <h1>Chapter 1130</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How did this happen? What the hell is Robert Brewer doing? I've drugged him. He&rsquo;s supposed to be completely drugged by now! However, he can't even subdue a woman!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was also stunned. She did not expect to see Brian when the door opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you... doing here?" Grace asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian came back to his senses and hurried over to Grace. "Are you okay? Did anything happen to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace could finish, Brian saw some tears on the sleeve of her shirt. It was not obvious at first sight, but he could see it when he got closer. "What's this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He grabbed me a few times when he came near," said Grace. However, she probably had to discard her shirt. The tears were in visible areas. She could not mend them even if she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian immediately turned pale and gently pulled Grace's sleeve up a little. He then saw the visible scratches on her arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those scratches hurt his eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know how she managed to save herself, but if this man wearing only a pair of boxers had succeeded, he did not even want to think&hellip; about the consequences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Robert Brewer suddenly turned over, staggered up from the ground, and jumped at Grace. "I... want you. Give me quickly... Give me... I... I can't take it anymore..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Robert Brewer was completely under the drug's control. He could not tell things apart at all. He just instinctively wanted to find a woman to relieve himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Robert Brewer who had suddenly rushed over, Brian instantly grabbed him and hit him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though his right hand was still bandaged, his left hand was relentless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those who had crowded around to see the commotion were astonished to see the crown prince, who was known for his indifference and elegance, beating a man so violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this the... The crown prince?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if the crown prince wanted to go hard on someone, he had plenty of ways. He would never do it himself. Not to mention&hellip; doing it in such a direct way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop it!" Grace rushed forward and grabbed Brian's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had seen Brian hitting someone at the charity gala's entrance last time. This was the second time! "This man must have taken some kind of drug. He probably doesn't even know what he's doing right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned and looked at Grace. "But he almost..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's probably a victim too. Besides, I was only scratched on the arm. I&rsquo;m not seriously injured," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she could almost guess who was the one behind this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian finally stopped hitting Robert Brewer, and the police and paramedics had now squeezed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the paramedics saw the way Robert Brewer looked, they immediately carried Robert Brewer onto the stretcher. "Who called 120?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I did!" Grace said immediately. She briefly explained to the paramedics how Robert Brewer flared up when she found him earlier and told them her guess that he might have been drugged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The paramedics carried Robert Brewer away quickly, then Grace said to the two policemen who came in, "I'm also the one who called the police just now. The man was drugged, and the lounge door was locked from the outside once I entered."</p></div>
