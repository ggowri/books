        <h1>Chapter 2846</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So that's what you wanted to ask." Brian suddenly understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded and immediately added, "Of course, it... it doesn't matter if you don't tell me. It doesn't matter at all..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she lowered her head, not wanting him to see her embarrassed expression and flushed face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You changed out of your clothes yourself," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Myself?" Valda Theller suddenly raised her head and stared at Brian in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Yes, but... it's not like I wasn&rsquo;t involved. After I brought you home yesterday, you woke up and started yelling that the gown wasn't comfortable, so you tried to get it off. But the gown had a zipper at the back and you couldn't pull it down anymore after pulling a third of it. Then you insisted that I pull the zipper for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And then..." she asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And then?" Brian had a faint smile he did not even notice. When she started to strip herself out of the gown last night, he turned away and did not look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she walked over to him when she could not get the zipper down. Her hands grabbed his waist as she yelled, "I... I need you to help unzip my dress or... I&rsquo;ll feel uncomfortable..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt as if a small animal was rubbing at him. Valda Theller was so soft that he wanted to hug her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He closed his eyes and tried to unzip her dress, but her hands began tugging his tie when he turned around. "Just... Just cover your eyes with this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry. I've closed my eyes and won't look," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She mumbled, "No, I can only be relieved... after you... blindfold yourself... I... I don't have a good figure. My boobs... uh... they&rsquo;re rather small. I can't let you see them... or... or you'll be disappointed. But... don't worry... I... I'll try to make them grow a little bigger..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been a little irritated by her distrust but did not know whether to laugh or cry when he heard her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you said you don't have a good figure and your boobs are small. You were worried I'd be disappointed. It wasn&rsquo;t enough for you that I had closed my eyes. You wouldn't be at ease until I put my tie over my eyes," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt like killing herself. 'Gosh! What did I say?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had known, she would have pretended she knew nothing and would not have asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." She looked at him sheepishly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I covered my eyes with a tie and pulled the zipper down for you. Then you took off the gown and ran to the wardrobe to take your pajamas before changing into them. You only removed my tie when you were done. So you don't have to worry about me seeing anything," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was slightly relieved. It turned out she changed into her pajamas herself after getting drunk!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stammered, "Well... Forget what I said last night... Forget it all... I... I&rsquo;ll prepare the hotpot for tonight first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she hurriedly went round Brian and immersed herself in cleaning the ingredients.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian leaned against a wall and watched. He failed to mention that she did not remove his tie from over his eyes as soon as she had changed into her pajamas. Instead, she had thrust herself into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was caught off guard as she pressed him on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, her lips were on his.</p></div>
