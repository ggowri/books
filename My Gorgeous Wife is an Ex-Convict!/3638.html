        <h1>Chapter 3636</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William instinctively took a step forward and protected Jasper from the little boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little boy flinched, but mustered up the courage to say, "Big brother, big sister, please, can you spare some money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's expression twitched as he looked at the child. From his appearance, he didn't seem like a typical beggar. His clothes were worn out, with torn sleeves and knees, and he was holding a regular enamel bowl, different from the ones beggars usually use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are your parents?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have parents, only a grandmother. She's sick, and I want to buy her something good to eat," the little boy replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's gaze flickered as she listened, and then she took out a few hundred </span><span>dollar</span><span> bills from her pocket and placed them in the boy's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little boy looked shocked, clearly not expecting the big sister to give him so much money all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep this money safe, don't lose it, okay?" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little boy nodded quickly, "Thank you... thank you, big sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, go buy some delicious food for your grandmother," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little boy turned and ran away. William said, "Who knows if what the kid said is true or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it's not true, it doesn't matter," Jasper said. "If it's false, I'll only lose a few hundred bucks. But if it's true, then my little help might be able to make this child a little happier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her abilities were limited, and there were too many people in this city who needed help. She couldn't help them all, but since she encountered this child, she hoped to give him a little bit of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder if Lawrence, after his parents had an accident and he disappeared, ever ended up on the streets. And back then, did anyone give Lawrence warmth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking about?" William's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was thinking about the children in the orphanage," Jasper said. "I told you before, our team organizes volunteering at the orphanage, taking turns to go and play music for the children there, using music therapy to provide them with some psychological treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, many of the children in the orphanage were abandoned by their parents, or perhaps both parents had died, and they became orphans. Naturally, these children would have more psychological issues than ordinary children, so we can't ignore their mental problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she goes to the orphanage to play music for those children, she would wonder if Lawrence had also ended up in an orphanage back then, and what kind of psychological issues he might have had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because... his parents were killed right in front of him, and those criminals even chased after him all the way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having experienced such darkness, it's only natural for him to have psychological issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hopes that during those years of his disappearance, he could have encountered someone who treated him well, allowing his psychological trauma to gradually heal and live a good life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, I want to buy some things and visit the children at the orphanage. It's been a long time since I last saw them," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," William smiled in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Jasper bought several bags of snacks that the children liked, and William drove them to the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Jasper arrived at the orphanage, the staff there, upon seeing Jasper, smiled and said, "Miss Reed, you've come. Coincidentally, your classmate is here today too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Classmate?" Jasper was taken aback.</span></p></div>
