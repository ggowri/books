        <h1>Chapter 286</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she continued working here in the future, she might not be able to avoid &lsquo;special treatment&rsquo; and would suffer peculiar looks from the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll pass. I want to change my working environment," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see." The director thought that the big shot behind Grace was going to give her a decent job, so with some more dissuasions, he agreed to Grace's resignation. Besides, he did not deduct her leave money and gave her one month's salary. He even got the finance department to settle it immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once out of the Sanitation Service Center, Grace took a deep breath. The extra one month's salary was also a gesture of goodwill from the director, which, to put it simply, had something to do with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had the backbone, she would have refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, she could not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her grandmother was still in the hospital. The money borrowed from Lina last time might not last long, and there might be subsequent expenses later. By then, her old debt would not be cleared, and she would owe a new one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked to the place where Claire worked and said goodbye to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Claire learned that Grace had resigned, she hurriedly said, "Why did you resign so suddenly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not good to ask for leave all the time," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is an accident. You can just ask for leave, I can do more," Claire said, looking at Grace's ten fingers that were still wrapped in gauze. "Is your hand all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can remove the gauze in two more days. It's all right," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What kind of job are you going to look for?" Claire asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe I&rsquo;ll work as a food delivery rider," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's going to be hard work." Claire sighed. She had to run around for that job, and it cost a lot more energy than sweeping the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not afraid of hard work." Grace smiled faintly. All she was afraid of now was the lack of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One would only know the importance of money when they needed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she was back in Reed Residence, Grace found Jason sitting on the sofa, waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come here," he said to her, holding out one hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip a little, hesitated for a moment, and went to his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took her hands gently in both of his and stroked his fingers over hers that were wrapped in gauze. "Where have you been?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was at the Sanitation Service Center," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The driver said you insisted that you didn't want him to send you there and got on the bus instead?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not used to being picked up," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a good thing you're back now. When you came back, he didn't see you and could not catch which bus you were on. If you had come back 15 minutes later, I'd have the whole city looking for you," Jason said calmly as if he was just casually talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback. "The whole city... looking for me?" That was a bit of an exaggeration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't I tell you to recuperate? What were you doing at the Sanitation Service Center?" He said and instructed the servant to bring her daily change of medicine and gauze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I went to go through the formalities of resigning," she answered truthfully. He probably would have found out eventually even if she did not tell him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to change your job? Why don't I see if I have a job for you?" he said.</p></div>
