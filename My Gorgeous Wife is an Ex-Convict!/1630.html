        <h1>Chapter 1628</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Speaking of which, Grace sighed. "If only my mentor had been my lawyer that year..." Then maybe she would not have spent three years in jail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was only being emotional, but Jason's heart suddenly violently contracted upon hearing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had forgiven him after learning the truth of the case back then but her body had still resisted him and even hated him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm sorry," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was shocked and immediately realized what he meant by his apology.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She thought for a moment and said, "Jay, I already forgave you for the case even though I was really sad when I found out the truth. I was heartbroken, upset, and didn't know who I could trust."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a pause, she slowly raised her hands and held his face. His skin was slightly cool, and his beautiful peach blossom eyes were staring at her right now. There was pain and regret in those eyes, just like back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her heart could not help wrenching again with a tinge of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "But I know you also regret having coldly looked on and not reaching out to help me when you knew who the real perpetrator was. That's why you kept asking me when we were together if I would forgive you when I found out that you had done something wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You know what I answered you back then?" she said, not knowing he had restored that part of his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His thin lips parted slightly, and he asked somewhat hoarsely, "What did you answer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I said I would forgive you. Even if you had done something wrong, I would forgive you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes glimmered slightly. "Did you forgive me because of that promise?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She bit her red lip slightly. "Not just because of the promise, but also because... I love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There seemed to be a hint of surprise in his eyes, and he looked at her somewhat blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If it were anyone else, I would never forgive them. But Jay, I was willing to forgive because it was you... You're the one I want to be with forever and the one I can't bear to leave even though I'm in pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He raised his hand and gently covered the back of her hand. "Grace... say it again. Say you can't bear to leave me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I can't bear to leave you," she repeated just as he wanted. "Jay, you know what? You always make my heart ache."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just like how there was a look of fragility and attachment in his eyes that made her heart ache faintly as though it was being pinched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She hoped he could smile happily and those beautiful peach blossom eyes could stop showing that look of fragility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's nose felt sore. Everyone thought he was strong and only respected and feared him. Even when the old master was alive, he just treated him as a tool to continue the Reed family's glory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was the only one who cared about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, you were the man I remembered and the man I wanted to be with when I lost my memories, so stop being upset. Because I'll never leave you," she said as she stood on her tiptoes and kissed him on the lips!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wanted to assure him and stop him from being this upset again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she could not do it five years ago, she hoped she could now!</p></div>
