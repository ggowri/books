        <h1>Chapter 1705</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow wanted to give the money to Grace again, and Grace took it this time. "Okay, I'll take the money. You can pay me the rest when you've saved enough money. We'll send you home now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina drove Grace and the two children to the He family&rsquo;s house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When they got there, the two adults sent the two children to the door of the He family&rsquo;s house. Their stepmother, Rosalind Bush, opened the door. When she saw the two children, she immediately shouted at Veronica Barlow, "Where the hell did you go, girl? If you don't want to stay in this house, then get out as soon as possible with that drag!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I left a note. I brought Mason to the hospital!" Veronica Barlow said with a straight face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Note? Hmph, what hospital? I think the two of you just went somewhere to play! Did you destroy someone else's property and need to pay compensation? I'm telling you, all the money in this house is mine and your dad's. None of it belongs to your dead mother!" Rosalind Bush scolded Veronica Barlow, thinking that Grace and Lina were here to ask for compensation after the children had caused some trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't talk about my mom like that!" Veronica Barlow instantly glared at Rosalind Bush like an enraged lion cub.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what if I talk about your mom? You're still dependent on your dad and me! I&rsquo;m warning you, you'd better behave yourself&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could not help but interrupt and say, "What are you talking about? You're their stepmother. Even if these two children aren't your own, you're still a mother. How can you scold them like that? Not to mention the way you beat the kid up. Do you know how many bruises Mason has on his body?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Rosalind Bush snapped. "As you said, I'm a mother. How I educate my children is my business. What does it have to do with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Lina's face reddened with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stepped forward and said to Rosalind Bush with a straight face, "Yes, you can educate your children, but it doesn't mean you can hit them. The hospital has test reports for Mason's injuries. If necessary, I can give these materials to the police or the local child protection agency. If it&rsquo;s proven that you're abusing your children, you&rsquo;ll be sentenced right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Rosalind Bush's expression changed. "Are... Are you threatening me? Which family doesn't hit their children? Do you have to go to jail for a couple of beatings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "That depends on what kind of beatings. The injuries on Mason today aren't ordinary beatings. Also, I&rsquo;m not simply threatening you. I'm a lawyer, and I can take legal responsibility for every word I say!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The atmosphere instantly froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Who is it?" The owner of the house, Archer Barlow, shouted as he came out. He could not help pausing at the sight of the confrontation before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Hello, Mr. He. My name is Grace, and I'm a lawyer. We accompanied the children to the hospital today. Li Ci is suffering from a lot of injuries, so please don't be so heavy-handed when you're educating him next time. Otherwise, you'll be suspected of child abuse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Archer Barlow instantly turned pale and said, "Yes... Yes, we'll pay attention to it! So sorry to have bothered you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, Archer Barlow pulled the two children into the house and shut the door!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina snapped. "Parents like them are really... I think they'll beat the kids up again! If you adopt a child and don't take good care of them, you might as well let others take care of them. Why adopt them in the first place? Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's eyes glimmered as if she had thought of something. 'Adopt... The He family only adopted Mason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the evening, Grace brought up the topic with Jason. <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>"What do you say if we adopt another child?"</p></div>
