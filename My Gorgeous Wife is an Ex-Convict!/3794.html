        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" William grabbed Lawrence by the collar and glared at him fiercely. "She's not someone you can toy with. If you continue to act recklessly, one day you'll exhaust the last bit of affection she has for you in her heart. I hope when that day comes, you won't regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence's face darkened. "What do you mean? What do you mean by 'won't regret it'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you understand? Or are you pretending not to?" William said. "She...doesn't owe you anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, William let go of Lawrence and left on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence stood there, staring at William's back, feeling a sense of unease in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came back for revenge. The more Jasper suffered, the happier he would be. What was there to regret?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When William found Mason, Mason had finished his class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, can we talk?" William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason glanced at William indifferently. "I don't think we have anything to talk about. If you want to find Jasper, you can call her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard you broke up with Sister Veronica, and Jasper is worried about you," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked coldly at him. "Since when did you become so nosy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Jasper's Mason, so it's not nosy," William smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who I break up with is none of your business, and I'm not interested in talking to you," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason finally got back together with Sister Veronica, wouldn't there be any regrets if they really broke up again?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regrets? Mason lifted his foot and didn't intend to pay attention to William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William quickly followed, "Mason, don't you really want to talk about it? Is the sudden breakup because of Daniel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the word "Daniel" came out of William's mouth, Mason's footsteps suddenly paused, and his gaze shot towards William like an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't the right place to talk about this. Why don't we find a place to sit down and talk?" William smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes later, Mason and William were sitting in a private room at a restaurant near the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That day at the school festival, the private room we ate in was also in this restaurant," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason pursed his lips, "How much do you know about Daniel's situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know that Daniel contacted a law firm in Emerald City today and is probably planning to sue you. Because this law firm has some connections with my family, they called my father, and my father told me. I'm sure Auntie Grace knows by now too," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason frowned. He didn't want to involve his family in these matters, but now, even if Jasper didn't say anything, his family would probably know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And along with the incident at the hospital where he hit Daniel, they would all know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper is really worried about you. You're siblings, it's only natural for her to worry about you," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, I'll talk to Jasper later," Mason said. "As for breaking up with Veronica, it's just that I'm tired and don't want to continue the relationship anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So even if Veronica dates someone else in the future, or even gets married and has children with someone else, you don't mind?" William asked.</span></p></div>
