        <h1>Chapter 4366 Never Get Close for the Sake of Profit</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought we were friends already, or do you think what I just said to Lornell was a joke?" Harley looked at Calvert, who was hanging his head in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Calvert was seen as a confident and charismatic model in the eyes of others, he always seemed to carry a sense of inferiority when he was in front of Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was somewhat at a loss: "I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think we're not friends, then what makes you believe that once you become a famous model, you can be my friend?" Harley took a step closer to Calvert and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" He was taken aback, his beautiful eyes meeting Harley's stunning ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this circle, there are many top models who want to be my friends. Besides, there are many popular stars, famous directors, and producers who want to befriend me, because I am Harley." She was the heiress of the Hart family, and she was very clear about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people didn't want to be friends with her because they liked her or thought she was great. They were purely interested in gaining more benefits from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you want to be my friend just because I'm Harley because I'm the daughter of the Hart family?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stared blankly at the person in front of him. He had a hunch that this question was about his future. If he didn't answer it well, she might never stand so close to him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope we can become friends because you're different from all the rich people I've met before, you..." He paused as if gathering the courage to say, "You don't look down on me with a superior gaze, instead, you look at me with an equal eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley chuckled. She knew that her own glow wasn't due to her abilities or talents. It was simply because of the aura of the Hart family. Without that, she was just an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we're friends," Harley said, "But I hope you're being honest today. Never approach me with ulterior motives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Calvert responded gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert seemed to understand that if he approached her with ulterior motives, they wouldn't even be able to remain friends!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't without any intentions. He wanted to be friends with her, hoping she would pay more attention to him, hoping to get closer to her, hoping to hear her talk more...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Are these goals considered interests?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it didn't count, then could he have stayed by her side forever with this intention?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Harley had occasionally met with Calvert in private, getting to know some of his family affairs. He learned that Calvert's mother had abandoned him, and his father was fond of gambling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Harley's view, it was nothing short of a miracle that Calvert had grown up so well, with good values and no bad habits to speak of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the income from his modeling career, Calvert had moved to a new place. He sent some money to his father every month, and for the time being, they were getting along peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? Today's your birthday?" Harley looked at Calvert with a surprised expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm-hmm." He nodded, "Thank you so much for agreeing to have dinner with me today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." Harley was at a loss for words. What was there to thank for in this situation? "Why didn't you tell me about your birthday earlier? I didn't even prepare a gift!"</span></p></div>
