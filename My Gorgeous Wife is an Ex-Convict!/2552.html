        <h1>Chapter 2550</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's expression changed instantly. 'Has&hellip; Has he found out?&rsquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;m not wondering whose child he is. I already know that Simon isn't your child. I only want to know how you managed to make him your child." George Gregory asked darkly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell suddenly laughed as if releasing her fear after it reached its climax. With this laugh, her twisted and repressed feelings were released.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did I do it? George Gregory, it's all thanks to you! If you hadn't turned a blind eye to Amber Mitchell at that time, you would&rsquo;ve known that she was pregnant with your child and I wouldn't have gotten the opportunity. It's a pity that she risked her life to give birth to the baby but ended up thinking that she gave birth to a stillborn!&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did you say? She risked her life to give birth to the baby?" he asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. She was hoping you'd get her out of the mental hospital!" Louise Mitchell said with a laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's face began to turn pale, and his hands at his sides clenched slowly as his nails dug into his palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It turns out Amber Mitchell was pregnant with my baby! She was locked up in the mental hospital while pregnant with my baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What was Amber Mitchell thinking while waiting for me to rescue her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But what about me? I married Louise Mitchell and ignored her. I didn't even allow people around me to talk about her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory felt a severe tightness in his heart. It felt like a heavy hammer hitting his heart. Then waves of pain continuously spread in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Louise Mitchell, you should just die!" George Gregory glared at the woman in front of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To think that a woman he had always looked down on would make such a fool of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I should just die? You're the one who should die. George Gregory, do you think you're a saint? What happened to Amber Mitchell despite her loving you so much? You dumped her after she got into the car accident. Hahaha!" Louise Mitchell laughed louder than ever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory suddenly got up, reached over the table, and grabbed Louise Mitchell by the neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's face instantly turned red. She stuck her tongue out, gasping for breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she seemed to be adding fuel to the fire by saying with difficulty, "You&rsquo;ve always thought... that Amber Mitchell cheated on you, didn't you? In fact... nothing ever went on... between her and Herman Moss. She had always loved you... It's funny that Herman Moss was actually saying goodbye to... Amber Mitchell on the day of the accident. Herman Moss was planning to go abroad, while Amber Mitchell... was only wishing him a safe trip... Amber Mitchell wanted nothing more than to be your bride at the time... Even..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even what?" George Gregory suddenly loosened his fingers and asked as he stared at Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Cough cough..." Louise Mitchell choked several times before catching her breath. Looking at George Gregory's ghastly pale face, she suddenly felt a sense of revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man's expression finally changed. He was no longer that high and mighty person who could manipulate others at will!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I even told Amber Mitchell that she should get together with Herman Moss and let me have you since Herman Moss liked her while I loved you. But guess what she said?" Louise Mitchell said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's lips quivered, but not a word came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly felt anxious. He had a premonition that what Louise Mitchell was going to utter would cause him a lifetime of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps what he should do now was stop listening and get out of here!</p></div>
