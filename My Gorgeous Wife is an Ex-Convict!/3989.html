        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there would have been no more hiding or deception between them from the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because she fell in love with him too late, or he loved her too early?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps life is full of regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was someone she didn't deserve, and now she didn't want to deceive him anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Nancy's silence, Mick frowned. "What's wrong? Is this question so difficult to answer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lower lip hard and after a while finally said, "It's not difficult, I... would still make the same choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed her collar tightly and asked, "The same choice, which means you don't regret it at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no room for regret." She looked up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome face was now filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she had known him, he had always been good at concealing his emotions, and the most she could feel from him was perhaps his expressionless face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his expression was so vivid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if all the veils that had once shrouded his face had been torn off, with no more concealment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by no room for regret?" He glared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are not me. You were born as the high and mighty Reed family's young master, and no one dared to disrespect you or bully you. You could easily distinguish right from wrong." She murmured, with a painful look in her almond eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I am different!" Nancy took a deep breath and continued, "I saw my mother fall off the building with my own eyes. I wanted to seek justice for her, but the police didn't believe me. The Schultz family's servants testified for Clarissa, proving that my mother fell off the building by herself and had nothing to do with Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In front of the wealthy and powerful Schultz family, I had no way to do anything for my mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know how to describe the feeling of powerlessness and guilt. As long as I can seek justice for my mother, I can sacrifice everything, even if it means becoming despicable and shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She told him everything she thought, because she didn't want to deceive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her despicableness, her darkness, her wickedness... she told him everything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So as long as I can seek justice for your mother, you don't mind using me, pretending to love me, or even having sex with me, right?" Mick said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," she said, "so you can take revenge on me however you want, I'm willing to bear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she owed him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her, his gaze becoming increasingly dark and his previously excited emotions turning into his usual expressionless state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, there was no emotion to be seen on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then... have sex with me," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy suddenly froze, staring wide-eyed, unable to believe what she had just heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you admit that having sex with me doesn't matter, then let's do it," he said. "Didn't you prepare yourself mentally to have sex with me when you went to the hotel with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's face gradually turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she went to the hotel with him, she really intended to use her body to get closer to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had prepared herself mentally for everything, and he didn't touch her. Instead, he took care of her all night because she had gotten drunk to boost her courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a gentleman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even bother to take advantage of a woman's body.</span></p></div>
