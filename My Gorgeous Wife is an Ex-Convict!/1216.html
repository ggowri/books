        <h1>Chapter 1215</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you're... not thinking about Grace, are you? Is it really okay for you to argue with Grace because of my lawsuit? Grace was even willing to beg to see you for Chase Harper. Is it alright for you to reject seeing her?" Stella said, pretending to be apologetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You needn't ask any more questions about us. Just talk to your lawyer about the issues that are related to the lawsuit," Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella suddenly started sobbing and seemed to wipe her tears as she lowered her head. "Brian, thank you. I thought you love Grace and would show your concern for her by advising me not to sue Chase Harper. I thought you&rsquo;d ask me to swallow the grievance, but... I didn't expect you to hire a lawyer for me and help me with my case. Thank you. That's so nice of you. You're... still the same person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to call him Bryn but gave up after remembering his previous warnings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no need to annoy him with a name. After all, the most important thing now was for him to avoid meeting Grace as much as possible and become increasingly estranged from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at Stella. "As long as everything you say is true, of course, I'll help you get justice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Grace was determined to help Chase Harper, he would see her after the case was resolved. He wanted her to know that Chase Harper, whom she cared about, was unworthy of her trust!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then she would naturally see that she had trusted the wrong man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian thought so at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could not tell whether he wanted justice for Stella or whether... he was more jealous of Chase Harper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lay on the hospital bed in the hospital's VIP ward with an IV drip on the back of her hand. Her pale face was so similar in shade to the white sheets covering her. She looked so haggard. Her brows were still furrowed even in her unconscious state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor had told Jason about Grace's current condition&mdash;slight dehydration, fatigue, excessive mood swings, and so on... These were exactly as Jason had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason was shocked when the doctor paused and said the next sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins is now 13 weeks pregnant and needs to take in enough nutrition. Otherwise, she might be at risk of miscarrying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? Did you say she's... pregnant?" The cold voice was a little out of tune when it spat these words out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were very few things in the world that could shock Jason. However, Jason was shocked now, looking incredulous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, the fetus is doing okay. But Miss Cummins has to take good care of the fetus after fainting this time," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason turned his head and stared at Grace who was still asleep. '13 weeks. That's three months ago, so the baby she&rsquo;s carrying now... is mine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's carrying my baby!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's heart was filled with a mixture of emotions. 'Does she know she's pregnant? And I...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason kept quiet as he stared at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was also shocked. 'Grace is pregnant? And by the look on Master Reed's face right now, the baby should be his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Grace just... make it?'</p></div>
