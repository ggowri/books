        <h1>Chapter 95</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn was a little confused. She hadn't expected that Brian would take a fancy to her lips.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But no matter what, this was her luck.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had to seize hold of Brian Hart and become the most popular actress. She could even... marry into a wealthy family and live a completely different life!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Evelyn seemed to have foreseen a good life in the future. However, she had not noticed that although the person in front of her was smiling, the smile was not genuine.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"By the way, do you know Jason Reed?" Brian suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn shook her head. How would she have ever gotten a chance to know someone like Jason?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian pursed his lips and said, "Don't get yourself into any trouble in the future. If you really offend him, I may not be able to protect you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, the more important thing was whether or not he still wanted to protect her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it was just for the sake of a substitute, there would be no need for him to go against Jason Reed. A substitute... Brian&rsquo;s eyes seemed to be covered in a layer of mist.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After searching for so many years, just how many substitutes would he have to go through to suppress the desire in his body?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before the engagement ceremony, Sean specifically sought out Jason and said, "Mr. Reed, it's a great honor to have you attend our humble event."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I will naturally come to your engagement party." Jason seemed to be hinting at something else as he said, "Speaking of which, it was not bad for you to break up with Grace before. This way, she has given up on you. If you had not given up on Grace at that time, perhaps today she still wouldn't have let you go."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean looked embarrassed. He didn't know whether he should respond to this or not.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh yes, how long will your sister be staying in the hospital this time?" Jason asked in a casual manner.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"One month." Sean felt a chill in his heart and quickly added, "But I'm afraid it will take half a year for the wound to heal completely."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He certainly knew how his sister had sustained this injury. But at this time, even if he knew, he had to pretend that he didn't.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then don't let her go out for the next half a year and make her stay at home to recuperate," Jason said faintly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay," Sean quickly replied. "I will make sure that my parents take good care of Zoe and let her stay at home to take care of herself."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Being able to read the situation was one of Sean's strongest characteristics.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was why he had broken up with Grace as soon as something bad happened to her. That was why he didn't dare to ask more about his sister's situation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, when your engagement ceremony is over, I'll leave. Grace is still waiting for me to return," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Sean no longer felt that it was because of his relationship with the Atkinson family that Jason had come to attend the engagement ceremony. He felt as if Jason was afraid... That he and Grace would have a chance in the future, so he had to come to watch the engagement ceremony personally. To ensure that Sean would be off the market, so to speak.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did Jason even consider Jennifer Atkinson to be as important as she had been back then?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It could mean only one thing&mdash;that Grace was of great importance to Jason Reed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean still could not believe it.</p></div>
