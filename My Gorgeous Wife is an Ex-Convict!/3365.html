        <h1>Chapter 3363</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already told my classmates that I'm going to see the Sleeping Cat Cartoon Exhibition!" Tina emphasized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So you can tell your classmates tomorrow that you're not going," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mummy, you can't do this. You're always chasing after those handsome guys yourself! Why won't you let me go see the Sleeping Cat exhibition?" Tina shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina's expression changed and she glanced at her husband from the corner of her eye before saying, "Nonsense, my mom doesn't go around chasing after handsome guys!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why not? Just a few days ago, I saw Mom secretly taking out a photo album of handsome guys from the safe in the closet!" Tina retorted bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina is sweating profusely. Please, when did your daughter see it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I remember there was a name on the cover, in the middle of the word, but I don't recognize it," Tina said, trying to recall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hubery Fidel, " said Hadwin. He glanced at his wife and then smiled slightly. "Lina, come with me to the study. Let's talk about something important."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Recently, within the past year, my wife has gained another idol named Hubery Fidel. He only became popular in middle age, and although he is already in his thirties, he looks young due to good maintenance. He is talented in singing, dancing, and acting, and my wife praises him as a great example of hard work paying off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, Hadwin has become somewhat numb to his wife's idol worship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, my wife has this hobby and there's no way to change it. He knew about this little hobby of hers since the beginning of their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina had a pained expression on her face as she followed Hadwin to the study. As they walked, she said, "Hadwin, Tina actually didn't see the whole picture. The truth of the matter is this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at the study, Hadwin closed the door and calmly asked, "Oh? So what's the truth? I remember you promised me not to buy Hubery's photo album a while ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well...one day I happened to pass by a bookstore and saw it, so I bought it," she said with an awkward smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, you didn't buy it on purpose?" Hadwin raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely not!" She quickly assured him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then tell me, which day did you buy it and from which bookstore? I remember Hubery's photo album this time was a limited edition, and it was sold out as soon as it came out. Which bookstore is so powerful to still have stock?" Hadwin asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina was dumbfounded, "You...you know about this too?" She had originally wanted to brush it off, but it was clear that her husband knew everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin approached Lina and said, "My wife loves Hubery so much, so as her husband, I naturally have to know more about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina chuckled dryly.</p></div>
