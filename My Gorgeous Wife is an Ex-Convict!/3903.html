        <h1>Chapter 3901</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the household staff already called him Mason, it was only natural for them to call her Mrs. Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica rubbed her nose and said, "It looks like I need to get used to this title quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need to rush. You can take your time to adjust," he said, leaning down and getting closer to her. "Tonight is our wedding night. I want you to only think of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face turned red all of a sudden. When did he learn to say such sweet words?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he said it with a serious expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he finished speaking, his lips brushed against her cheek and then moved down her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But...I haven't taken off my dress yet," Veronica said, feeling embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll help you," he whispered, his fingers already on the zipper of her dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..." Her face turned even redder. As the zipper slid down, she could feel her skin exposed to the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally, he could see every inch of her skin as it was revealed to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face felt like it was on fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Veronica herself didn't understand why she suddenly felt embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had been "honest with each other" before, so why was this moment different?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at this moment, she was too shy to look into his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" His voice whispered in her ear, with a hint of hoarseness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"N-nothing," she said, biting her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it's nothing, then why won't you look at me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course... it was because she was embarrassed! Veronica screamed in her mind, but what came out of her mouth was, "Don't look at me like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You haven't even looked at me, so how do you know how I'm looking at you?" He cupped her face in his hands, and at that moment, her gaze finally met his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your face is so red. Are you not used to this?" he continued, and her red dress had already slipped off her shoulders, revealing most of her upper body to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't look..." she said awkwardly, trying to pull up her dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his hand caught hers first. "We're husband and wife now, and besides, your body is beautiful..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Beautiful? Veronica seriously doubted it. Her figure was just average, and even a bit thin. From certain angles, it was clear that there were many areas that were lacking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's beautiful...so much so that I can't keep my sanity," he said softly, as if he could see the doubt in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His kisses rained down on her, one after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He worshipped her body with his kisses, making Veronica feel hotter and hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop!" she cried out softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He crouched down, looking up at her, "Don't you like it when I kiss you like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I want to kiss you too!" she said honestly, her face turning red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled slightly, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He tilted his head back, and as soon as she lowered hers, he could easily kiss her lips.</p></div>
