        <h1>Chapter 4049</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, I love you!" he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I love you too! I will only love you for the rest of my life." She responded, holding his face and kissing him actively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, Nancy witnessed Mick's great energy, which made her want to take back her previous words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had actually doubted whether her husband's "energy" was lacking due to work before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was simply impossible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Nancy woke up with a sore back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to sleep a little longer?" Mick asked. He seemed to be full of energy compared to her, who felt sore even lifting her arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I'll freshen up. We have to go back to the mansion today." Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had the wedding yesterday, and if they arrived too late today, it would seem like she didn't understand etiquette - even though the Reed family didn't really care about these things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you decide." Mick didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy got out of bed and headed to the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had only taken two steps when her legs suddenly gave out, and she almost fell. If Mick hadn't supported her waist, she would have fallen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Mick asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just... my legs are a bit weak," Nancy muttered apologetically. "It's because of what you did last night..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick immediately understood what was going on. "Okay, it's my fault. I didn't control myself yesterday," he said, carrying Nancy to the bathroom and helping her freshen up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they came out of the bathroom, Mick helped Nancy change her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had been living together for a while now, and they had seen everything there was to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, when she had just given birth, Nancy couldn't move much, and Mick had personally taken care of her, helping her bathe and change clothes, and even preventing the caregivers from doing it for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So even though Nancy was a bit embarrassed now, her arms were still sore, so she let Mick take care of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After changing into casual clothes, Mick started to comb Nancy's hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You know how to do this?" Nancy was a bit surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not that hard," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't planning on doing a simple ponytail, was he? If it was just a regular ponytail, then it really wasn't that hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to Nancy's surprise, Mick didn't do a ponytail. Instead, he braided her hair in a more complex way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when he finished, Nancy's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had a classical feel to it, but also gave off a youthful and sweet vibe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you learn to braid hair?" she asked in amazement. She had no idea he had this skill!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I learned recently. I figured since you and the baby are both girls, it'll come in handy someday," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How long have you been learning?" Nancy asked again. She wondered if he was working hard on braiding every night before going to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just check the video time and watch a few minutes every day," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Huh?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy blinked, "A few minutes?"</p></div>
