        <h1>Chapter 2069</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss had always been imposing. Now, he was even exuding a threatening aura as if he was silently blocking Chase Harper from Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The atmosphere suddenly became a little awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla quickly said to Chase Harper, "Chase, take Juliet home first. Mr. Weiss will take me home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper hesitated a little. "Okay, be safe... then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure," answered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper finished the formalities at the police station and left with his daughter. Martin Weiss stared at Kyla. "You call me Mr. Weiss but call him Chase?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One could tell whether they were familiar from that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at Martin Weiss somewhat speechlessly, "Should I call you Lil Ye?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened as he pursed his lips in silence. Compared to Lil Ye, it seemed that... Mr. Weiss sounded better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hungry? Do you want something to eat?" he asked after checking the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "No thanks, I'm going back to the store. Thank you for helping us find Juliet today. I gotta go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, before she could take a step, Martin Weiss grabbed her by the hand. "What's the matter? You were willing to get into my car when you needed my help. And now that you don't, you won't get into my car anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That&rsquo;s not it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, before she could finish, he had taken her hand and walked out of the police station. They went to his car and he opened the door to the passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla knew what Martin Weiss meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was insisting on taking her home today. Thinking that he had helped them find Juliet, Kyla pressed her lips together and got in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss drove toward Kyla's store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the way there, Martin Weiss said, "I don't see any need for Nelson to learn taekwondo. No matter how much he learns, it's just a way to help him keep fit. Taekwondo is of little use for when he&rsquo;s in trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla thought of what his son had said before. "So what combat practice did you take him to see that day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"To be precise, what he saw was Sanda with a few tweaks. If he wants to learn martial arts, it would be better if he learns that. It would also be enough for him to protect himself," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was silent for a moment before saying, "I'll ask Nelson. If he's willing to learn, I won't object."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss smiled at that. "That's great."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car was quiet again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, Kyla quivered slightly. She pressed the area where her liver was with one hand, only feeling a dull ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Since her liver transplant, she would go for a check-up every six months. Although the results were good, the area around her liver would still ache dully sometimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla gritted her teeth slightly, planning to swallow the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Are you okay?" Even though she tried to keep calm, Martin Weiss noticed something wrong with her and pulled over to the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nothing, I'm only feeling a little uncomfortable. I'll be alright in a minute," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes fell on the place where her hand was, and he frowned. "What is it? Is the area where your liver is aching? When did the pain start? Is the pain severe?"</p></div>
