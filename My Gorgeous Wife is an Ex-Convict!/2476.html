        <h1>Chapter 2474</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some even speculated that she might get back together with George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Netizen 1: [Herman Moss is dead, and Amber Mitchell has nothing left. Who will she turn to if she doesn&rsquo;t turn to George Gregory?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Other people left comments under that comment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Netizen 2: [Amber Mitchell used to have good looks, but now... She's considered a cripple, isn't she? She's even missing a finger. George Gregory can have any beautiful woman he wants. Will he take a fancy to Amber Mitchell?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Netizen 3: [Besides, it&rsquo;ll be funny if Amber Mitchell gets together with George Gregory. The former fianc&eacute;e is willing to be a homewrecker, while a homewrecker's bastard daughter becomes the wife. What a reversal!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Netizen 4: [Louise Mitchell even gave George Gregory a son. There's no way Amber Mitchell can shake Louise Mitchell's status!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell found the comments ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never thought of returning to George Gregory&rsquo;s side again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could these people think that someone who had been hurt so badly would return to the person who abandoned her in her hour of need?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing as he had abandoned her once, there would certainly be a second and a third time&hellip; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to be abandoned anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her love for George Gregory had been exhausted long ago. She was only left with hatred for him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the door was pushed open, and a bodyguard who looked like he was 30 years old walked up to Amber Mitchell, "Miss Mitchell, Young Madam is on her way and will arrive in a moment. Let's go to the hospital&rsquo;s entrance. We'll leave in a car when Young Madam arrives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Amber Mitchell nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bodyguard offered to help Amber Mitchell carry her luggage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Amber Mitchell left the ward, she realized there were about 20 bodyguards walking with her to the hospital&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh... I'm just going to the hospital&rsquo;s entrance. I don't need so many people to accompany me, do I?" Amber Mitchell said. After all, there were too many people to fit in one elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Madam said it's necessary. The entrance of the hospital is a little chaotic right now," the bodyguard said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Chaotic?' Amber Mitchell's eyes gleamed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are there a lot of reporters out there?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she arrived at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance, she found that reporters weren&rsquo;t the only people here. There were also members of the Mitchell family. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man she was supposed to call her father was saying how much he loved her and how happy he was that his daughter was finally a normal person after years of treatment! He also said he wanted to take her home and take good care of his daughter's health. He had been distressed over how his daughter would often harm herself over the years because of her mental illness. Now that his daughter was normal, he believed she would not harm herself again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell could hardly listen any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man was insincere to her mother back then. He had even indifferently ordered their servants, "The young miss isn't in her right mind. Tie her up. I'm taking her to the hospital for treatment!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kept struggling and screaming. "I'm not ill. I'm not insane. I'm normal!"</p></div>
