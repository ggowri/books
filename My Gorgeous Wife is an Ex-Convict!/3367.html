        <h1>Chapter 3365</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this the result of your thinking?" he said, raising his hand and poking the still visible bruise on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, it hurts... hurts..." she couldn't help but cry out in pain. She was already so pitiful, yet he still poked her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know it hurts. In the future, when you encounter situations like this, don't rush into it easily. If you want to protect Harley, there are other ways to do it," he said. These days, every time he saw her injuries, he felt guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had followed her closely at that time, this incident would not have happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh." Tina obediently responded, then snuggled up to Chandler and began to act cute. "Chandler, can you take me with you? I know you're the best to me, you'll definitely say yes, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler pursed his thin lips. He is now 15 years old and no longer a little boy. Although Tina is only 8 years old, she is his destined wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the moment she was born, he has been tirelessly caring for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He originally thought that he would marry her in the future because she was the one who was most suitable for him in the world, according to the prophecy of their family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But over the years, he realized that he had unknowingly invested much more emotions in her than he had thought, under the guise of care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her wishes, he will find a way to help her achieve them. If she gets into trouble, he will clean up the mess for her. All of these things are actually quite different from what he initially expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he doesn't reject it, in fact, he even feels grateful that she is the one destined to spend her life with him. It's wonderful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had her by his side for his whole life, he wouldn't feel too lonely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will you fight again next time?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No more fighting, I promise!" Tina quickly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What will you do if something like this happens again?" he continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Find mommy and daddy, find an adult!" she answered quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised an eyebrow, clearly unsatisfied with her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at his expression and suddenly thought of something, quickly adding, "And find you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then was he satisfied, raising his hand to tap her forehead. "Don't forget next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina pouted and rubbed the spot where he tapped her, "I won't forget..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But inside, she was overjoyed. Oh, she was going to the Sleeping Cat exhibition!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the weekend, Chandler took Tina to the Sleeping Cat exhibition, and Hadwin and Lina didn't have any objections to this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Chandler is now 15 years old and has always been mature and responsible. Hadwin and Lina, as his parents, trust him to take care of their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Chandler has Hunter's bodyguard by his side, so if anything happens, Hunter's bodyguard can also intervene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was very excited early in the morning. She even changed into her new dress and brought a small bag with her. The bag was filled with the pocket money she took out from her piggy bank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In order to prevent her daughter from developing poor money habits and spending recklessly from a young age, Lina has always been quite restrained in this regard. She has not given her daughter any credit cards or similar items, and instead follows the typical approach of providing her daughter with a set amount of pocket money each month. If the money runs out, her daughter can apply for a portion of the next month's allowance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, on the other hand, next month's pocket money will be deducted by this amount.</p></div>
