        <h1>Chapter 2089</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss seemed to see the panic and tension in her eyes and said, "Yes, I know you're pregnant! You're four weeks pregnant. The baby is from that night!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was not even asking but affirming!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if he was confident that she was carrying his baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla only felt her palms and back breaking out in a cold sweat. Even so, she still denied it. "I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not pregnant. Martin Weiss, you're overthinking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He suddenly sneered. "Do you want me to take you to the hospital and meet the doctor who diagnosed you so that you'll admit it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You investigated me?" Her voice sharpened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I didn't mean to investigate you. I just happened to see you in the hospital and was worried about your health. I wanted to know what was wrong with you," he said, but it was from that incident that he found out about her pregnancy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If I never found out, were you going to keep it a secret from me forever?" he asked as he moved closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She pressed her somewhat dry lips together. "It's none of your business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "How is it none of my business? You're carrying our baby. I'm the father, and you're saying it's none of my business?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"This baby..." Kyla had just started speaking when the familiar feeling of nausea suddenly surged again. She could not help but throw up all over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His crisp suit was stained with her vomit, but she continued vomiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Blaargh... Blaargh..." Kyla bent over as she threw up violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss seemed flustered as he could only blankly watch her throw up non-stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The last time she got pregnant, she was sent to jail. He was never involved in her pregnancy, nor did he know that morning sickness could be so severe that it was as if one was going to throw up everything in one&rsquo;s stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Kyla finally stopped throwing up, she looked up and saw Martin Weiss's pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he looked worse than she did now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your clothes..." Then, her eyes fell on his suit that was stained with her vomit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why did you throw up like that?" he asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's just morning sickness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her explanation did not put him at ease. He unbuttoned and removed his vomit-stained suit jacket. He grabbed her toward the car parked by the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She twisted her wrist as she struggled. "Martin Weiss, where are you taking me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"To the hospital!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">15 minutes later, Kyla returned to the consultation room she was in earlier and faced the doctor she met not long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor explained to Martin Weiss that throwing up like that was normal. Only when the mother was throwing up too much and it affected her nutritional absorption did she need drug treatment and intervention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor said, "We generally don't recommend medication to stop throwing up during the first trimester of pregnancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Should I just let her throw up so much, then?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor suggested, "She can eat some food that will help with the vomiting, such as prunes, oranges, and so on. Anything with a slightly sour taste might help pregnant women with the vomiting."</p></div>
