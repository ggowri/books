        <h1>Chapter 2876</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze slightly. 'What does that mean?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">20 minutes later, Valda Theller figured out what it meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Staring at the two female bodyguards, Valda Theller looked at Brian in disbelief. "Are you locking me up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll be staying in the mansion. They&rsquo;ll be looking after you, so don't try to escape. Don&rsquo;t secretly take any medicine either. I&rsquo;ll set you free if you're not pregnant in a month. If you're pregnant..." His voice stopped as he stared at her with his dark phoenix eyes. "You'll give birth to the baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked. She knew Brian was not joking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the problem was... "We've broken up. Why do you want me to give birth to the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you love me!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was speechless. Then, she showed a hurt look on her face. "Brian, you bastard!" She suddenly shouted at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time she had called him names since they met. She had not even said anything bad to him when they broke, yet she was now calling him names!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned to say to the two female bodyguards. "Look after her. Forget about having an easy life if anything happens to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two bodyguards quickly replied in acknowledgment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian then hurried away as if he was fleeing from something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Walking out of the house, he got into his car and leaned heavily against his seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not mean to hurt her, but he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her love for him seemed to be all he had left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never liked children, but maybe the baby would bring them back together if she was indeed pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew he had acted impulsively and selfishly today, but he just could not get her to cut off the last possibility between him and her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is wrong with me? Since when did I care so much about Valda Theller?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shaking his head, Brian straightened up, started the car, and sped away from the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and the two bodyguards looked at each other in the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller did not expect Brian to lock her up in the mansion and assign two bodyguards to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took out her phone after some consideration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of the bodyguards said, "Miss Theller, it&rsquo;ll be pointless to call the police. With Mr. Hart's influence, he can keep you here in many ways."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller knew that! "I'm not calling the police. I'm only calling my friend to tell her my work arrangement and where I&rsquo;ve gone. Otherwise, she'll be worried."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she called Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille, I&rsquo;ll be staying at Brian's mansion for the time being, and I won&rsquo;t be going to the studio either. Call me or email me if you have anything work-related to tell me. I'll email you the comic manuscript."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're staying at Brian's mansion?" Camille Strickland was shocked. "Didn't you guys break up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but something came up, so... Uh... Anyway, I might have to stay over there for a while and take care of things," Valda Theller said vaguely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was confused. What else did sh need to take care of after breaking up?</p></div>
