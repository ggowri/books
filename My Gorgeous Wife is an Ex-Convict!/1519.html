        <h1>Chapter 1517</h1>
        <div><p>“I know, I saw it on the news,” Grace said. She bit her lip. “If Jay has really given away all his love to that person and has no more feelings for me, I won’t pester him any longer. But… if the person Jay loves is still me, I won’t leave him!”</p><p>Everyone had thought that she was dead. It was perfectly reasonable for Jay to fall in love with someone else or remarry.</p><p>However, she inexplicably had this feeling that her Jay would be like her. His heart would never beat for someone else other than her.</p><p>During the past few years when she lost all her memories, she had encountered a few outstanding men who were attracted to her, but she had never felt anything for them.</p><p>It was only after her memories gradually came back that she realized her heart had been completely given away to a man named Jason. With that, she no longer had anything she could give.</p><p>“Right, how about you? Do you have a partner now?” Grace changed the topic.</p><p>“Me? Not yet! I’m still single in old age. My mother’s pestering me about this all the time.” Lina shrugged with a smile that was tinged with bitterness.</p><p>In the past few years, she would try not to think about Hadwin Stephenson, but the man would always appear in her head briefly. Maybe it was because she had been too happy during her relationship with the man. Now, she did not have the urge to fall in love no matter what kind of men she met. She had gone on blind dates, but they always fizzled out.</p><p>“Have you still not let go of him?” Grace looked at her good friend, feeling sorry for her.</p><p>“I’m trying hard.” Lina smiled. “If I really can’t, I’ll just be single my whole life. It’s not that scary. I have your two children to send me off when I die, anyway.”</p><p>Lina paused abruptly after saying that. She turned to Grace with an apologetic look.</p><p>Grace looked dejected for a while.</p><p>Two children… She had given birth to triplets, but at last… Jason had one child with him, and she had one with her as well. Then… where was the remaining one?</p><p>Where was the remaining child? Was the Reed family secretly hiding them? Perhaps… </p><p>At this moment, Jasper let out a shout of alarm. Grace became alert. She looked in her daughter’s direction, only to see her fighting with another girl.</p><p>“Jasper!” Grace surged forward hurriedly, wanting to pull her daughter away. However, before she could approach them, another woman had gone over and shoved Jasper away roughly.</p><p>The girl failed to reorient herself and ended up falling down. Luckily, there were cushions beneath her and nothing big happened.</p><p>Grace ran to her daughter and helped her up.</p><p>Lina followed suit. She said, looking full of worry, “Are you okay?”</p><p>Jasper shook her head, and her almond-shaped eyes were watery. “Mommy, Daddy’s photos are torn. She tried to take them from me.”</p><p>It was only then when Grace discovered that her daughter was holding half of the candid photo of Jason that she had bought at a high price!</p><p>As for the one who tried to take it away… She looked up, and what a coincidence! They were the Lynch mother-and-daughter duo Lina had told her about just now!</p><p></p></div>
