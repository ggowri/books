        <h1>Chapter 3374</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If we were to follow Lina's words, then it would seem that Brian is becoming more approachable as time goes on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley was staring straight at a nearby indoor play area for children from their dining table. "Mommy, I want to go play there!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has been playing for a whole morning and doesn't feel tired at all. She is full of energy and wants to continue playing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once you finish eating, you can go play for a while," said Valda. Her daughter had a very active personality among girls, and only occasionally would she be quiet for a while when she read some children's books by herself. Most of the time, she was always thinking about playing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." Harley obediently listened, but her eyes were still fixed on the amusement area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Brian came back with the purchased food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them started eating. Although the little one could eat by herself now, she tended to make a mess and sometimes dropped food on herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian had prepared a disposable bib for his daughter and helped her tidy her hair and wipe her mouth from time to time, becoming the best dad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Brian took care of his daughter's food, Valda had a much easier time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley ate quickly this time and finished in no time. As soon as she finished, she asked, "Mommy, can I go play now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at her daughter's clean plate and smiled, "Okay, you can go play. Mommy will accompany you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one cheered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian glanced at Valda's unfinished food and said, "You can continue eating. I'll have someone watch her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, Brian raised his finger and a bodyguard immediately came over. Following Brian's instructions, he took Harley to the amusement area in the restaurant to play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is no longer surprised by the sudden appearance of these bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, she came to know that he always had a number of bodyguards following him around, but he did so only out of concern for her safety. He made sure that the bodyguards stayed in the shadows and tried not to be noticed by her, so as not to make her uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that this was his way of protecting her and their daughter because they were too important to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So even though she still feels a bit uncomfortable, she will still make herself adapt and get used to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to her, Harley adapted quickly. After all, since her birth, there were already nannies, caregivers, and various security personnel surrounding her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So when the bodyguard suddenly appeared, she didn't feel any discomfort or fear. Even though he was a stranger to her, Grace happily followed him to play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at her daughter, who was excited and not shy at all, and couldn't help but exclaim to Brian, "Do you think Harley's lack of shyness will make her more susceptible to being kidnapped?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, there are quite a few cases of child abduction and trafficking nowadays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who dares to kidnap our daughter?" Brian said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda thought about it and realized that it made sense. Anyone who tried to kidnap children would likely be taken down by the bodyguards he had arranged before getting close to his daughter.</p></div>
