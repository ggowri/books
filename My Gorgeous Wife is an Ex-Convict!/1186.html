        <h1>Chapter 1185</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her figure, Chase Harper suddenly unbuckled his seat belt and got out of the car. He quickly caught up with her. "Grace! I... I wish you happiness!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He blushed a little as he said this. It was as though he had taken great courage. "Though... I'm not the one to give you happiness, I still hope the woman I like can be happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the person in front of her with a warm feeling in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you. You... are a nice man." She had always found his simplicity, warmth, and kindness to others precious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A nice man...' Chase Harper sighed in his heart. He was a nice man, but he was not a man she would love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." He paused, and his face grew redder as if he was hesitating and struggling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? If there's anything else, you can just say it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can... I hug you? Just a little while. Think of it as saying goodbye to my feelings in the past..." He smiled wryly and said, "I was going to say that, but I think it's too much for me to make such a request when you&rsquo;ve never loved me, and I&rsquo;ve always been hotheaded and caused you trouble..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before he finished speaking, Grace took a step forward and took the initiative to embrace Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper froze and blushed as if he were a cooked shrimp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chase Harper, you're a nice man. I think it's my loss not to have fallen in love with you. You'll find someone who will reciprocate your feelings! Just like how you hope I can be happy, I hope you can be happy too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper lowered his head and looked at the woman who was holding him. It was the first time that the woman he loved took the initiative to embrace him just to fulfill his wish and not let him regret it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace looked cold and indifferent sometimes, he knew she was a kind person. Otherwise, he would not have fallen for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, neither Chase Harper nor Grace noticed that someone was hiding in a dark corner not far away, taking photos of this scene with their phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Brian returned to his ward after a check-up to find Stella frantically arranging something, but carelessly, the things in her hands spilled all over the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella crouched down to pick them up as if she did not want Brian to see them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian had already seen what was on the ground. They were photos. Grace and Chase Harper were embracing each other in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Give me the photos," Brian said in a deep voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, don't look... at these photos. I... I'll get rid of these photos!" Stella said urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hand them over!" Brian's voice grew colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella could only hand Brian the photos. Brian looked at the photos in his hands. Although they were still photos, they had been taken continuously. It was clear that Grace had taken the initiative to embrace Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace... didn&rsquo;t show any reluctance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it true that she and Chase Harper are just former colleagues? I finally felt that we had gotten closer, but are we actually further away?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes stared at the photos, and his face showed a rare look of solemnity and... jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, someone came into the ward... with these photos and said he wanted you to see them for yourself. I don't know who he was. I wanted to ask more questions, but he left immediately. I was afraid it was something bad, so I opened it to check. Unexpectedly..." Stella's voice rang in Brian's ears.</p></div>
