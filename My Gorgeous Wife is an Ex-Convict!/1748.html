        <h1>Chapter 1746</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Mick Reed had doubts in his heart, he did not ask again. Even so, he was still curious about the grandmother he had never met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Jasper was asking Grace, Mick Reed was also staring at Grace curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace thought about it for a moment before saying, "Your grandma... I don't know where she is either, but Grandma ran away from home back then. She probably lost her way, so she never came back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That was as far as she could say for now. She did not want to expose her children to the dark realities of the adult world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper was instantly worried. "Grandma is lost? Then we must hurry and find Grandma, or she'll be all alone outside. How pitiful that will be!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one burst into tears as she spoke. Grace touched her daughter's small head. "Okay, Daddy and I will go look for Grandma."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew that Jay had been trying to track down his mother for years, but... she seemed to have disappeared and was never found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... if they did find her, how was Jay going to face his mother? His father would not have died, and his childhood would have been much happier if his mother had not abandoned his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His mother had been a thorn in his heart. Even the resemblance of his eyes with his mother's had once disgusted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A photo of Jason's mother, which Grace had seen before, flashed through her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was a beautiful woman, but the only thing Jay had in common with her was his eyes. The rest of Jay's face looked more like his father...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, a small figure flashed through Grace's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In her mind, Mason's face merged with the photo of the woman she had seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason... Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was shocked. Why did she just realize that Mason resembled Jay's mother except for the eyes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason's eyes... looked like the eyes of Jay's father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace tried hard to recall the photo she had once seen of Jason's father, which was displayed in the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The eyes of the man in the photo were calm and gentle. It was as if they contained a lot of affection... It was a far cry from Mason's cold and empty gaze, but their eyes were extremely similar in shape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Could... Mason be the child we have yet to find?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is that possible? Could it be so coincidental?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No, I... I want to meet Mason! I want to make things clear!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace suddenly got up and was about to leave. Just then, Uncle Kwan hurried over with a box. "Young Madam, someone delivered this box and we've checked its contents."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Uncle Kwan opened the box as he spoke. Inside was a small box containing a strand of hair and a piece of paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Words cut from old newspapers made up the sentences on the paper. It was simple, only saying that the child she and Jay had lost was now with them. They wanted the Reed family to prepare 100 million dollars before they would hand over the child!</p></div>
