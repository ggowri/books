        <h1>Chapter 846</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She wants to forget me, and she'll forget me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though her voice was calm, there was a clear sense of determination in it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he raised his hand and punched the car hard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed!" cried out the driver in a mutter. However, only a twisted gloom came over the handsome face of the high and mighty man in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went back to her house and collapsed into bed, exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so tired that it was as if she had fought a hard battle today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had made it clear. Surely, Jason would not appear in front of her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he was such a proud man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sis&hellip;' She did not expect to hear him call her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; again today. It reminded her of the life she had after bringing him back to the little rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Life was hard, but it was sweet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She really felt like she had a family again back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... She had no family after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I'm sure I can forget you," Grace muttered to herself, 'I&rsquo;ll forget about Jay and keep in mind that there's only Jason in this world!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was a man who was very respected in Emerald City and had nothing to do with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a sleepless night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to the office the next day with two dark circles under her eyes only to find her desk covered with yellow roses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. After taking a hasty look, there were probably hundreds of yellow roses covering her entire desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the other colleagues saw her, they approached her with a gossipy and ambiguous look while asking, "Grace, who gave you so many yellow roses?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not really Jason's girlfriend, are you? This many yellow roses may cost at least tens of thousands of dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, didn't Grace tell us that she's not Jason's girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then some rich man must be pursuing her. Wow, that's so enviable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw a card among the roses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she opened the card, there was a sentence written inside. &lsquo;Miss Cummins, please accept my apology. If you wish to ask for any compensation, you may do so.&rsquo; It was signed by Curtis Row.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was momentarily stunned but then understood what was going on soon enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Stella had told him that they were cousins that day and Stella was now a frequent companion of Brian, Curtis Row was afraid of offending her because he wanted to be friends with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he hastened to apologize to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Curtis Row did not know that she and Stella were not close at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella used to dislike her in many ways, and now that Stella had taken her place, she might be even more displeasing to her.</p></div>
