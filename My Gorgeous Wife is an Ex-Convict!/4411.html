        <h1>Chapter 4409: We Will Be Happy Together</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you two dating?" Brian asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," replied Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm asking him, Harley, don't rush to answer," Brian said to his daughter, his sharp gaze falling on Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert nervously moistened his somewhat dry lips, "Yes, Harley and I are dating."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you're good enough for her?" Brian asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad!" Harley called out, somewhat disgruntled. In her view, her father wasn't the type to care about status or rank. Otherwise, he wouldn't have ended up with her mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, her mother was just an ordinary person's daughter, not some high-society lady.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, however, paid no attention to his daughter, his gaze fixed solely on Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert took a deep breath and said, "I will strive to become someone worthy of her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the very beginning, there was a gap in their social statuses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was something he couldn't change, but he didn't want to back down and give up on Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he wants to give it his all to fight for what he wants!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stared intently at the person in front of him. Although Calvert was nervous, he didn't avoid the other's gaze, instead, he met it head-on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a good while, Brian said, "Alright, stay and have dinner with us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huh?!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked utterly bewildered, while Harley just chuckled and responded to their parents with a cheerful "Okay!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, her father's words were a sign of approval for Calvert to become her boyfriend!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until after dinner, when Harley saw Calvert out, that Calvert seemed a bit taken aback. "Did your parents agree to us dating?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, why else would I have invited you for dinner?" Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... how did they agree so quickly?" Calvert still found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else do you expect? Do you think this is like a TV drama where I'm supposed to deliberately make things difficult for you, humiliate you? Or do you want me to ask how much money it would take for you to leave me?" Harley retorted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents, they love me very much. So, whoever I love, they would never make it difficult for them," Harley said. "Calvert, I like you. So, no matter what your background is or what your past was like, my parents will definitely accept you. I know very well that all they want is for me to be happy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there, stunned. So, these were her parents? All they wanted was their child's happiness, so different from his own parents.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in his heart, there wasn't a shred of jealousy. He just felt so happy for her. She had such a wonderful family, such loving parents, and was living a great life. She didn't have to endure the hardships he had gone through. It was truly wonderful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Why so quiet?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley, all I want is for you to be happy." Even if they were to break up in the future, he would still wish her happiness. He didn't know how long their relationship would last, but every day he spent with her was an incredibly precious memory to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "We will be happy together, trust me, Calvert!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a very simple sentence, devoid of any fancy rhetoric, yet he believed in it profoundly!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simply because the person who said this was her - the one he loved most in his life!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the few days Harley stayed at home to recover before heading to Calvert, he had already handed over Calvert's agent and that Miss Maldonado to the police.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything is being handled by the police.</span></p></div>
