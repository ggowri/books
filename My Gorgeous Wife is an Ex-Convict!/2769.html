        <h1>Chapter 2767</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's none of your business whether I can afford it or not," Valda Theller replied coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver seemed to freeze for a while, not expecting that the pushover she could criticize at will in university would now give her a long face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Rhea Oliver, is this your friend?" The man who came with Rhea Oliver asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man wore branded clothes and a luxury watch. The cheapest watch from the brand cost 200,000 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver said in contempt, "I have no such friends. She's disgusting. You don't know how shameless she is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face turned pale instantly. Although Brian knew some of her dark history in university, she did not want him to learn anything from Rhea Oliver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that Rhea Oliver would say the most embarrassing things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just as she was about to stop Rhea Oliver from going on, another voice already rang out. "I don't care who you are, but if you insult my girlfriend again, I guarantee you&rsquo;ll be more miserable than my girlfriend was in university!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The affirmative tone and icy voice made Rhea Oliver stop speaking immediately. She shuddered and looked at Brian standing beside Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had his back against Rhea Oliver earlier, so she did not see what Brian looked like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had turned around now, so Rhea Oliver could finally see his face. She could see him now, so her heart instantly became filled with jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this man Valda Theller's boyfriend? Raymond Bowman is no match for the man in front of me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How did Valda Theller get a boyfriend like this?' Her boyfriend whom she had thought was a good catch as he was handsome and a rich heir was now nothing compared to Valda Theller's boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was probably tough earlier because she had her boyfriend as a backup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver said to Brian, "You probably don't know what your girlfriend was like in university, right? She's a master at faking things. She looks innocent but is actually shameless. She&rsquo;s been seducing men since she was in university&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems you don't take my warning seriously. I know Valda's character. I also know what she&rsquo;s gone through in university. Every word you say now will make things worse for you. I guarantee you!" Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fear suddenly rose in Rhea Oliver's heart. Perhaps he was so confident that it gave her the illusion that everything he said would come true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who... Who do you think you're threatening? You lunatic!" Rhea Oliver suppressed her panic and said, "I'm just reminding you out of kindness, lest the shameless woman fools you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Who's the shameless one here? All relevant details of your dirty deeds will be on the man's desk in three days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver's expression changed. There were plenty of things she had done that her boyfriend did not know about, but she had hidden everything so well that her boyfriend had no idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's boyfriend had suddenly said that. &lsquo;Does he know...' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she denied it. 'No way!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sir, it's ungentlemanly of you to talk to my girlfriend like that!' Rhea Oliver's boyfriend stood up for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian sneered. "I'm gentlemanly enough not to do anything right away. You're from the Lu family, aren't you? I advise you to leave immediately if you don't want the Lu family to suffer."</p></div>
