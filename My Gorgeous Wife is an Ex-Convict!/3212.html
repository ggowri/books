        <h1>Chapter 3210</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The screenshot is exactly the scene of Brian walking with her in the airport.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And then later, Camille wrote several lines of text, "Sister, you're really showing off your lovey-dovey relationship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Quickly check the trending topics, many people are speculating if you had too intense 'exercise' last night!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, have you arrived at your destination?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at her friend's string of messages and immediately started sweating profusely. She quickly went online to check and sure enough, it had made it to the trending topics. It was currently at number 13, but judging by the current trend, it might climb even higher soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda clicked on it and found out that it wasn't just photos, but people had also directly uploaded videos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the video, as Brian had mentioned before, she was wrapped in a blanket so that others couldn't see her face. She leaned against him, and the only things visible to others were her hair and the hand wearing a wedding ring that was outside the blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the problem is that the hand wearing the wedding ring is easily recognizable as hers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So there's no need for anyone else to check, and everyone understands that the person Brian was holding at the time was her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The comments were varied and often negative. However, the most popular comment was about how the intense battle from the previous night had led to her being carried into the airport like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is sweating profusely. She...she just slept too deeply, okay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you watching?" Brian leaned over and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You carried me into the airport today and someone saw us and took a picture. Now it's trending at number 13," Valda said as she handed her phone to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at the content above and asked, "Do you want me to explain?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it'll just make things worse," she replied. "Anyway, it doesn't matter what they say. We haven't done anything scandalous. We're married, so why worry about rumors?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled at her words and said, "You're right. We're married, so let them speculate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, where are you taking me for our first local meal?" Valda changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Brian and Valda began discussing what they would eat for their first local meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Brian isn't a celebrity, his face is recognizable, and with the recent hot search, they were recognized while walking on the street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, it didn't happen too often, or Valda would have thought she married a star!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Should I buy a mask to wear?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was puzzled and asked, "Why would you buy a mask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Prevent being recognized, so you can stroll around with peace of mind," he said. "You won't be bothered by these inexplicable things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not really inexplicable. At least it's because you're handsome that you're easily recognized. If it were a common face in the crowd, you wouldn't be recognized at all." She said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She amused him with her theory, causing him to relax his furrowed brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, there's no need to cover your face with a mask. You're not hiding from anyone," Valda said. "We're not having a secret affair, so there's no need to be secretive. Even if someone takes a picture of us during our honeymoon, it doesn't matter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her lack of concern surprised him.</p></div>
