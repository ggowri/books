        <h1>Chapter 3876</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Getting married during college...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's a bit too early!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the clinic, after the doctor looked at her report, he confirmed that she was indeed pregnant. Based on the last day of her menstrual cycle, she was already five weeks pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, for the next few days, she needed to come in every other day to have her blood checked to ensure that the pregnancy was progressing well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they left the hospital, Veronica was still in a daze, as if everything that had happened felt unreal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was really pregnant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There's a little life growing inside her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she didn't feel anything, the miracle of life was already developing in her abdomen, and this strange feeling made her feel dazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you think of my proposal earlier?" Mason's voice in the car brought her back to reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Proposal?" She was confused, but then realized he was probably talking about getting married. Since they were having a child now, then-"Let's get married!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica took a deep breath and gave her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the moment she said her answer, she suddenly felt a sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The confusion, worry, and anxiety of being pregnant seemed to disappear with those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you sure you're not just doing this out of obligation?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You and I were going to get married eventually, so why not do it sooner? Besides, we're already living together, so getting married won't really change anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're only five weeks pregnant, and usually the belly won't start showing until around four to five months. If we have the wedding before your belly shows, it might be rushed. Are you sure that's okay?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, he wanted to give her a perfect wedding and enough time to adjust mentally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for her, getting married now felt like being rushed into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay. The people who need to get married are us, and the wedding is just to let others know we're married and to receive their blessings. As long as I love you, you love me, and your family accepts me as part of the family, then that's enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for her family... Veronica's eyes dimmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want your father and them to attend the wedding, I can arrange it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need." Mason's words were interrupted by Veronica, "Since we have already made up our minds to cut ties, then we don't need them to attend my wedding. But I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated for a moment and murmured, "I want to go see my mother, tell her that I'm getting married, and about the baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, if the baby's condition stabilizes after the check-up in the next few days, we'll go see your mother," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother had passed away many years ago, but if her mother knew about it from the afterlife, she would be happy for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica had almost vomited everything she ate for lunch, and although she later ate some bread to fill her hunger, Mason was still worried that she would be hungry. So he took her to a restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until they got out of the car that Veronica realized that this was a restaurant specializing in cuisine for pregnant women.</p></div>
