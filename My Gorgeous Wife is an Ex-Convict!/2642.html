        <h1>Chapter 2640</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, mint green is in trend this year, and the color sells very well here," the shop assistant said as she brought over a mint green dress in size M.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took the dress into the fitting room to try it on, while Brian stood in the boutique's open space and glanced at the pastel purple dress hanging on a shelf not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Purple was Grace's favorite color. He once told her that he would buy her a beautiful purple dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, he bought a lot of purple dresses, but none of them were delivered to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those dresses were proof of his longing that was hidden with pain. These dresses were still in his mansion's wardrobe, and no one was allowed to touch them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller wanted to try the purple dress, he subconsciously asked her to change it to a mint green one. It meant he had not let go of his feelings for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Brian looked away from the dress and looked somewhere else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his pupils shrank immediately as he caught sight of a familiar figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not expect to see Grace here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Grace seemed to also feel the gaze and looked up in Brian's direction. Their eyes immediately met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace slowly walked up to Brian. "What a coincidence to see you here. Are you... here to help someone buy something?" After all, he was standing at a women's boutique.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm accompanying someone shopping," said Brian as he looked down at Grace's baby bump.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could easily tell that she was pregnant now. Her face was rosy, and she seemed to be in good health. However... he knew the baby in her belly was a ticking time bomb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked Lina to accompany me to buy some maternity clothes." Grace smiled. "Lina and I gotta go first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" Brian could not help shouting. It was not easy for him to run into her, and he did not want her to leave his sight so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there anything else?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you... these days? Are you physically..." Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Everything's fine," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nearby Lina also said, "Would Jason let her go shopping with me if there's something wrong with Grace's body?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pressed his thin lips together tightly. Just then, the fitting room door opened, and Valda Theller walked out. She was about to ask Brian whether the dress was suitable for her when she saw two women standing in front of Brian. One of them had a slightly bulging belly. She must be pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three obviously knew each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze, not knowing whether she should walk up to them or pretend she did not know Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shop assistant said to Brian, "Sir, your friend is out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned his head and looked at Valda Theller. Valda Theller smiled drily. Before she could say anything, Brian walked forward and took her hand naturally, "Here, Valda. Let me introduce you to my friends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, okay," replied Valda Theller as she followed Brian to Grace and Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is Valda Theller, my girlfriend. And this is Grace, my... friend, while this is Lina, a friend of Grace," Brian said as he introduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, I'm Valda Theller," Valda Theller said to the two with a smile.</p></div>
