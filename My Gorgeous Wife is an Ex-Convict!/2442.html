        <h1>Chapter 2440</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When will the results of the evaluation be out?&rdquo; Kyla asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;ll take at least another hour. Okay, don't overthink it. Get some rest. You're not alone now. You're pregnant," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she was consoling Kyla, there was obvious solemnity and apprehension on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As far as they knew, there were many policemen making their way over, including senior police officers of Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were indeed in the wrong. Louise Mitchell was Amber Mitchell's legal guardian. Once they found Amber Mitchell, they could stop the evaluation and take her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An hour was all they had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Jason and Brian had sent their bodyguards over to stop the other party and found various ways to delay their arrival, could they delay things for an hour?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent, while Jason and Brian said nothing. However, their faces seemed relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, Deer City was not Emerald City. They would face many restrictions in Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Kyla said to Martin Weiss, "I want to go over. Why don't you drive me there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's late, and it's inconvenient for you to go over. Grace also told you to rest," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Amber Mitchell..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Amber Mitchell that important? Is she worth risking your health and the life of the baby you're carrying? Grace and the rest are already there, while my men are still following the Mitchell family's men. Even if the Mitchell family finds Amber Mitchell and takes her away, your presence won&rsquo;t make a difference. There's nothing you can do about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla paled and hesitated for a moment. Then, she turned around and took her wallet before putting on a jacket. She wanted to go to the hotel&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly grabbed her. "Do you still want to go after I&rsquo;ve said so much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have to go. Amber Mitchell's my friend. Even Grace, who has nothing to do with Amber Mitchell, is trying her best to help Amber Mitchell. How can I not go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What can you do after you get there?!" shouted Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Protect Amber Mitchell. Perhaps having one more person there might help delay things for another minute," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't forget how you insisted on keeping the baby. And now? Have you stopped caring about the baby in your belly because of Amber Mitchell? There's bound to be some conflict, and there's no telling what might happen when you go there. I won't forgive you if anything happens to the child," Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, you&rsquo;ve never had someone control your life. You&rsquo;ve never lost your freedom or experienced pain. You don&rsquo;t understand what it&rsquo;s like. If someone helped you when you were in a situation like that and gave you hope to continue living, you&rsquo;d naturally feel indebted to them!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's voice struck Martin Weiss's heart like lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not directly accuse him of anything, but every word she said sounded like accusations. The way she looked at him even made him so embarrassed that he could not explain himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's grip loosened, and Kyla left the hotel room briskly.</p></div>
