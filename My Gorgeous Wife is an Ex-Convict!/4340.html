        <h1>Chapter 4338 The Spectator</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yep, I&#x27;ll definitely keep myself safe!&quot; Tina replied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Because she understood better than anyone else, that her own safety also meant Chandler&#x27;s safety.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It wasn&#x27;t just because of the magical creature within him, but more so because he loved her!</p><p style="text-align:left;">If anything were to happen to her, this man would probably find it hard to go on living!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tina really wished she could regain her lost memories!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley stepped out to the small garden outside the banquet hall for some fresh air.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Today is the Quentin family&#x27;s banquet. As the most outstanding among the younger generation of the Quentin family, Lornell naturally attracts a lot of attention.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But the more people&#x27;s gazes fell on Lornell, the more Harley felt a sense of embarrassment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Simply because the person standing next to Lornell wasn&#x27;t her!</p><p style="text-align:left;">How many people who attended the banquet that day were secretly mocking her in their hearts?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just then, footsteps echoed from behind Harley.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley turned around, surprisingly finding Ursula there.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Shouldn&#x27;t she have been by Lornell&#x27;s side? Why was she here? A question flashed through Harley&#x27;s mind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ursula began, &quot;Hello, Miss Hart.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Hello,&quot; Harley replied, &quot;Can I help you with something?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The look in Ursula&#x27;s eyes at that moment made it clear to Harley that she must have come specifically to find her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Is Miss Hart really planning to keep this up?&quot; Ursula asked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley squinted slightly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ursula chuckled, continuing, &quot;Lornell doesn&#x27;t love you, and I think Miss Hart is well aware of that. Miss Hart, you&#x27;re a catch yourself, so why insist on keeping this engagement? Lornell is just a kind soul. He was forced to propose to you years ago to save your life, but you&#x27;ve been using this engagement to tie him down ever since. Don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s a bit selfish?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley stared at Ursula, her voice icy as she asked, &quot;And in what capacity are you here, telling me all this?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Why so angry, Miss Hart? I&#x27;m just an observer, trying to advise Miss Hart...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before Ursula could finish her sentence, Harley interrupted her, &quot;And what gives you the right to advise me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ursula&#x27;s face turned slightly unpleasant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Miss Snider, I&#x27;m not upset, but I just want to clarify, what exactly is your role, and what gives you the right to advise? Your last name is Snider, not Quentin or Hart. In the end, you&#x27;re just a distant relative of the Quentin family. Now you&#x27;re discussing my engagement with Lornell in front of me. Don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;re overstepping?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I was just trying to be nice, I didn&#x27;t expect you to misunderstand, Miss Hart,&quot; Ursula quickly defended herself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So, you&#x27;re being kind?&quot; Harley sneered, &quot;Well, it just so happens that members of the Quentin family and the Hart family are here today. After the banquet, my parents and I will find the Quentin family members and share your &#x27;kindness&#x27; with them. Let&#x27;s see how they interpret your &#x27;kindness&#x27;.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ursula&#x27;s face instantly turned pale: &quot;You...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Miss Snider, don&#x27;t forget my last name is Hart!&quot; Harley said, before turning around and walking away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, just as she took a few steps, she saw Lornell standing off to the side at the garden exit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It seemed like Lornell had been standing there for a while.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So, how much of her conversation with Ursula did he actually hear?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley suddenly felt a pang of disappointment. Lornell clearly had no intention of helping her. Even when Ursula was targeting her just now, Lornell merely stood by as a spectator.</p></div>
