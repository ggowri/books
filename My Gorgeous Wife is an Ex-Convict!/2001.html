        <h1>Chapter 1999</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The dark eyes similar to hers were full of seriousness, which made her understand that these were not empty threats!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's all I have to say, so you'd better go abroad soon. Maybe our bond as mother and son will last a little longer." Hadwin Stephenson left after finishing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers's legs felt weak, and she fell to the ground. Her body still trembled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina waited for Hadwin Stephenson in Stephenson Residence. As soon as she saw Hadwin Stephenson return, she immediately approached him and asked with concern, "How was the board meeting today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nothing happened. Everything's as usual," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Does that mean you won?" She felt a thrill of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "You can say that. Put on a coat. I'm taking you out later..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"To see Anthony Sherman," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze. When she followed Hadwin Stephenson to a private residence, she saw a man with a scruffy beard. It was Anthony Sherman. His hair looked like it had not been washed in days as it was greasy. The clothes he wore were wrinkly, and he looked so much thinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The person in front of her was different from the Anthony Sherman in her memory. The smart man now looked dejected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After seeing Lina, a bitter smile appeared on Anthony Sherman's face. "Lina, I'm sorry," he said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why did you post such a thing? Why didn't you explain when people pointed fingers at me?" asked Lina. She had so many questions she wanted to ask him. She even thought of hitting and kicking him to vent her anger if she ever saw him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when she did meet him, she thought that the perpetrator looked worse than the victim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I had to do it," said Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is it because Hadwin's mother paid you?" asked Lina. Hadwin had told her on their way here that the culprit behind Anthony Sherman's incident was his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina knew how much Emily Flowers disliked her, so she was not too surprised. However, she was afraid that Hadwin Stephenson would feel remorseful, so she kept comforting him on their way here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't know who paid me, but they also gave me a plane ticket," said Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said coldly, "I thought we were friends and that you were an honest man. I never thought money could buy you off so easily and make you say something so horrible! How much money did you take, then? I want to know how much your slander costs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Eight million dollars," Anthony Sherman said bitterly as he felt a pang of discomfort in his heart. He liked the woman before him. He even thought maybe his life could return to the right track if he married her. Perhaps he would have something to look forward to, but...</p></div>
