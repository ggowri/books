        <h1>Chapter 4197</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina closed her eyes again, but her mouth kept asking, "Do you think the person I dreamt of is someone I knew before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her memory loss, she didn't know who she used to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's probably just an insignificant dream, don't think too much about it. You said you couldn't even see the man's face clearly, so how would I know if it's someone you knew before?" Kit said, "Alright, go to sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina fell asleep again quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit, however, stared at Tina's sleeping face, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tina's belly grew bigger day by day, Kit bought many books about expectant mothers and newborns. He also specifically watched educational videos online for new dads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, by the way, have you thought of a name for the baby?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit stiffened, then forced a smile, "You can choose a name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to name the child?" Tina's eyes flickered with disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's just that I'm afraid I won't be able to come up with a good name. I'm not talented at naming." Kit quickly explained, but in fact, he felt that he had no right to name the child in her belly. After all, he was just a fraud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, then, I'll come up with a name for the baby. But what name would sound good if the last name is Hunter?" Tina muttered to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit suddenly said, "Let the child have the same surname as you. I don't want the child to have my surname because my father wasn't good. I don't want that surname to be part of the child's name!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, it's Tina and Chandler's child. What right does he have to have the child use his surname?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's just a pitiful liar!</span></p></div>
