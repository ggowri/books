        <h1>Chapter 271</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her nose became sore, and the tears that had stopped for a moment came rushing back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to cry, then just cry, Sis." His fingertips brushed over her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;sis&rsquo; acted like a key, releasing all the pain and sorrow that had been repressed and locked up in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unable to contain her overwhelming emotions right now, Grace let out a sharp wail and finally burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had not cried so bitterly for a long time. She realized a long time ago that no matter how loudly she wept or how much tears she shed that it would be useless. She had nothing to rely on but herself. Those tears were nothing but worthless things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, hearing him call her &lsquo;sis&rsquo; made her think of her mother, of the brother in her belly who had taken shape but never made it out to call her &lsquo;sis&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If her mother and brother had not died, would she be less lonely? Would she be given the chance to have a real family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's crying took Jason by surprise. If he was distressed by her biting her lip and weeping in silence, then right now he was so overwhelmed that he did not even know what to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she burst into tears, he froze as if every nerve in his body had been frozen too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never felt so helpless. Even when his mother left him and his father froze to death in the snow, he did not feel as bad as he was feeling at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While facing the crying Grace, he felt like ice and fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wished she would not be in such pain, but his body was so stiff that he could not react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, she plunged her head into his arms. With her face buried in his chest, she kept crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tears, soaking through the fabric of his chest, seemed to have penetrated into his body. Her salty tears went along with the flow of his blood and rushed to his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Jason raised his stiff hand and hugged her gingerly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she was so depressed and miserable, she could cry, but... she could only cry in front of him. He did not want others to see her crying in this sad and fragile state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His desire to possess her was only deepening over time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car arrived at the Reed Residence, the driver got out respectfully, but Jason remained seated. He just held Grace in his arms, allowing her to cry to her heart's content.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one knew how long she had been crying for, but she finally stopped. He lowered his head to see that she had cried herself to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were tears all over her face, and her eyes were red and swollen from crying. In addition to that, her hands were both wrapped in white gauze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked so pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, there was the sound of a cell phone ringing. It was Grace&rsquo;s phone that was in her pocket. Jason looked at the words on the screen that spelled out, &lsquo;Lina&rsquo;. He frowned slightly and pressed the answer button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Grace? Why aren't you at home today? Are you working overtime?" Lina's voice came from the other end of the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She doesn't live there now, and she's asleep. If you need anything, call back tomorrow," Jason said in a low voice, worried of waking the one who had fallen asleep in his arms.</p></div>
