        <h1>Chapter 635</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman yelled in her heart. She was afraid of the man, so she was going to leave. There was plenty of fish in the sea anyway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I think I'd better leave now..." The woman smiled awkwardly and wanted to walk away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait..." Grace cried out, looking somewhat annoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wait? Like hell I'll wait!' The woman had no intention of stopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Jason's cold voice also rang. "Just wait."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Huh?' The woman was stunned, but before she could come to her senses, she was stopped by two powerful men who appeared out of nowhere. She was forced to return to the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was very regretful right now. Why did she have to flirt with him? Looking at the current situation, the man was obviously not the type to be messed with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who knows what will happen to me later!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Let's just talk it out. If I said something wrong or did something wrong, I... I apologize to both of you!" the woman said cautiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason ignored her and just looked at Grace. He said, "Well, look, here she is again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That doting look on his face only made people feel how blessed the one he was doting on must be. It was as if no matter what wind or waves there were, the man would protect her from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was now terrified that Grace would harm her or something. She suspected that if she wanted to kill her now, the man beside her would hand her a knife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Grace swayed and said drunkenly to the woman, "You haven't told me that you don't have any funny ideas about Jay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's heart that was on tenterhooks immediately felt like it could not be put to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... Made her wait and scared her to death just to say that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You mustn't... Have any funny ideas about Jay!" said Grace as she hiccuped. It was evident that she was concerned about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; I won't have any funny ideas about&hellip; Uh... Jay!" the woman said hurriedly, almost raising one hand to swear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace finally looked satisfied and turned to Jason. He held out her hand to lift Jason's chin and muttered, "That's right... Because Jason is mine..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, not only was the woman who came to flirt with Jason dumbstruck, but also the two bodyguards who stopped the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way Miss Cummins lifted Young Master Reed's chin looked... A bit flirtatious. Although Miss Cummins was now drunk, Young Master Reed had allowed her to flirt with him like that. It was incredible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the lights of the bar were flickering on and off. Jason&rsquo;s handsome face was dimly lit while his dark eyes stared at Grace quietly. There was an indescribable charm in his expression as the light glimmered on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Grace felt as if she was entirely captured by his eyes. It felt as if a stone was being dropped into her heart. It created ripples.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it a temptation? She could not help it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost instinctively, she ran her fingers over his eyes... How beautiful!</p></div>
