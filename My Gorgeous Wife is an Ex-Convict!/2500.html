        <h1>Chapter 2498</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly, lowered her head, and gently caressed her belly. Though he did not directly reject the idea of keeping the baby, she understood what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she were not pregnant, she would use contraceptives and choose not to have children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the accident had happened, and she had gotten pregnant. How could a mother give up her child so easily? Taking a deep breath, she looked up at Jason. "It's still unclear how the baby is doing and what my physical condition is like. We still need another pregnancy check-up. Why don't we decide after getting the results of the check-up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her wary eyes and finally uttered softly, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace finally let out a sigh of relief. She raised her hand, hugged Jason, and said, "Jay, don't worry. It&rsquo;s been six years since I last gave birth. Since I had a C-section, I can have another baby after two years. Besides, I&rsquo;ve been taking care of my health. It won't be that bad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No matter what happens, promise me you&rsquo;ll prioritize yourself if you have to choose between you and the baby, okay? I don't want to face the same situation as Martin Weiss one day!" Jason murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze, knowing that he had thought of Kyla's current situation. Kyla had been in the hospital every day. Martin Weiss said nothing about it, but he would go to the hospital every day in the dead of night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had no idea about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only knew because Jay had told her on the phone earlier. The bodyguard he had assigned to protect Kyla at the hospital told him about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They also discussed exactly what Martin Weiss thought of Kyla now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He must still love Kyla. It's not his character to spend long hours in her ward every night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think Martin Weiss would be willing to... save Kyla if something happens to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Jason could not have been more sure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was not that confident. After all, hypnosis had made him forget his feelings. Even though Martin Weiss had some feelings for Kyla, were they deep enough to put himself in danger to save Kyla and their child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, at least Martin Weiss can use his blood and liver to save Kyla if she's in danger. But if you&rsquo;re in real danger, what can I offer for your safety?" He had lived in fear every day when she was pregnant with the triplets. He watched her suffer for them, yet he could do nothing about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he have to go through all that fear and helplessness again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt sad. His voice was soft. He did not shout nor sob, but it made her feel like crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's still early. I'm only six weeks pregnant. We'll decide whether or not to keep the baby after going for a more thorough examination at the hospital, okay?" Grace asked. She thought of her unexpected pregnancy as a happy event.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect him to be so afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry. I'm sorry..." He kept apologizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's nothing to apologize for. Maybe God decided three kids aren't enough for us and wants to add another little life to our family." She kissed him as she spoke, "Trust me. I&rsquo;ll cherish my life because I want to be there for you and the kids. I won't be impulsive..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;She won't?' He accepted her soothing kiss passively.</p></div>
