        <h1>Chapter 3438</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not very good at playing ball," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, so what are you good at?" Daniel asked casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm good at fighting," Mason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere suddenly became awkward. Veronica quickly changed the subject and asked about today's game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel then smoothly shifted the conversation to the game and introduced the situation of both teams to Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, the three of them arrived at the gym. Daniel took them to his pre-reserved seats and then returned to the court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The players on the court were doing some warm-up exercises before the game. Someone saw Daniel running back and jokingly asked, "Didn't you say you invited a female student to watch the game? Why did you bring a guy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's her brother," Daniel explained to his friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brother? He doesn't look like her at all," the friend muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's not her biological brother, they just grew up together," Daniel said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Adopted, huh?" the friend said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel didn't go into detail about Mason living with the Barlow family. After all, it's not something that can be explained in just a few sentences. Plus, it's a private matter for the Barlow family, so Daniel didn't feel the need to discuss it with others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, this younger brother looks quite good. Aren't you worried that your junior might be interested in him? With his looks, he should be quite popular among girls." the other person said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Daniel thought of the rumors he had heard in school about Mason and Veronica, but then he said, "If there was anything going on, it would have happened already. They just have a simple brother-sister relationship!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The game started and because Veronica came to watch the match today, Daniel played more aggressively than usual. It was as if he was stimulated by something and his teammates joked that he was playing like he was cheating since the arrival of this new student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the game, Daniel performed well and Veronica watched attentively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason turned to look at Veronica beside him. At that moment, she was focused on watching the game, with her eyes fixed on Daniel... Mason felt a discomfort rising in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this discomfort, the feeling of being weighed down and almost unable to breathe, seems to be getting stronger and stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does Veronica like watching boys play ball?" Mason's voice suddenly sounded beside them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica turned to look at him upon hearing his words. "I'm fine, why do you suddenly ask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I feel like you're really into watching sports, and if you like watching guys play ball, then I can start playing too," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "You don't have to cater to my preferences. You should try something different and see what interests you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if what you like is what I like, is that not a good thing?" he asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, everyone is an individual and if you only like something because I do, then that's not really liking it," she said. "However, interests and hobbies can be developed over time, so there's no need to rush. Just like how you're learning martial arts, do you enjoy it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that he also took courses from the Reed family, especially in self-defense and martial arts, so his skills were much better than those of his peers.</p></div>
