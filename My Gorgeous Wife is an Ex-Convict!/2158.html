        <h1>Chapter 2156</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed frowned as if he was pondering something. His mother had told him Aunt Lina's newborn baby was beautiful, but he did not find her very beautiful at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed looked at his sister. 'Um... Jasper looks a lot better.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper stared at the baby curiously before carefully touching the baby's face. She thought that the baby was tiny, just like some of her bigger dolls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was not paying attention to the baby at all. All his attention was on Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How cute!" Veronica Barlow mumbled as she looked at the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had nothing to do with the Stephenson family, but aunt Cummins wanted to bring Mason here, and Mason insisted on bringing her. Hence, she came to have a look too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her eyes lit up as soon as she saw the baby. She thought the tiny baby felt soft and looked cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, as if feeling the gazes of so many people, the baby opened her eyes and began to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The confinement nanny nearby immediately held the baby and coaxed her. Soon, the baby stopped crying, and her dark eyes seemed to be looking around for something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Veronica Barlow found the baby utterly cute and could not help asking, "May I hold her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The confinement nanny looked at Veronica Barlow. She was already seven or eight years old and could hold a baby, so she carefully handed the baby to Veronica Barlow while telling her how to carry Tina Stephenson. After Veronica Barlow took over the baby, the confinement nanny maintained a protective gesture so that she could catch the baby in time in case Veronica Barlow lost her grip and dropped Tina Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Veronica Barlow seemed pretty skillful at carrying the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're good at carrying the baby," praised Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hehe, it's probably because I used to carry Mason a lot. When Mason first joined my family, I used to carry him every night," said Veronica Barlow. Mason was already three years old at that time, and she was only five years old. Hence, it was much more difficult to hold Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was relatively easy for her to carry the baby now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason seemed upset when he saw Veronica Barlow looking so happy carrying the baby. "Sis, I want to go to the back garden to play!" said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, now?" asked Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Now," Mason said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Veronica Barlow could only return the baby to the confinement nanny, and Mason swiftly dragged her out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper was eager to hold the baby. "I want to carry Tina too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The confinement nanny hesitated a little. "You're too small. Can you carry her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes! I won't drop Tina," Jasper said affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn thought about it and said, "Let Jasper sit on the couch. It's safer for her to carry Tina that way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The confinement nanny accepted the suggestion after thinking it over, so she asked Jasper to sit on the couch before carefully handing the baby in her arms to Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn and Mick Reed sat on either side of Jasper Reed. Nelson Corbyn reminded her now and then, "Keep your arms steady. Yes, that's it. Your arm should support the baby's head. The baby will feel comfortable if you hold her well..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the baby's head turned before she gave a yawn.</p></div>
