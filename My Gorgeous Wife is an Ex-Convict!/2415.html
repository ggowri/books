        <h1>Chapter 2413</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back at the Reed family&rsquo;s house, they would often listen to the two little ones play the piano after dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William had not played with Jasper for some time. However, the music rang out and their four little hands played on the piano so naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The others could not believe their tacit understanding. Besides, the two little ones were playing fast-tempo music. They only saw four small hands quickly moving on the piano keys while musical notes rang out one after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the Barlow family knew that Jasper was also a good piano player, William had always said that he was not as good as Jasper when he was praised for his piano skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the Barlow family had always thought he was humbling himself. After all, William's piano skills had been praised by accomplished pianists before. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing Jasper play the piano today, they thought that perhaps William was not being humble. At least to regular people like them, Jasper was just as good as William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they finished playing one tune, Jasper was still dissatisfied. She immediately played another tune, and William followed her as if words were not needed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tune after tune, they played nearly ten tunes before stopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Playing the piano with William is the best!" Jasper mumbled. He was the only one among her peers who could keep up with her. "Unfortunately, I can't play the piano with William every day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"After we grow up... I'll play the piano with you every day." William promised sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper furrowed her delicate eyebrows somewhat strangely. "We can do that after we grow up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, we can do that... after we grow up." He would be strong enough to deserve her and protect her, instead of having her protect him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper listened carefully. Then, she tilted her head, thought about it, and said, "Then we must grow up quickly so that we can be together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace talked about Amber Mitchell again during a chat with Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In this case, the point of Amber Mitchell losing her mind because of Herman Moss is indeed doubtful," said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, there's something I'm hoping you can help me with, Mr. Barlow," Grace took the opportunity and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow could not help but smile. "The famous Young master Reed of Emerald City is right by your side. Aren't you embarrassing Young master Reed by asking me for help?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Barlow, you have a lot of connections in Deer City. It&rsquo;d be much faster if you could help," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason also said, "If you can help us, you can put forward any conditions you want, Mr. Barlow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wonder what favor you need?" said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope you can secretly install surveillance cameras in Amber Mitchell's ward and find an authoritative psychiatrist to enter the ward in disguise. I want them to re-evaluate Amber Mitchell's mental health. Of course, I don't want all this to attract the Mitchell family's attention. I'm afraid the hospital nurses and Amber Mitchell's attending doctor have been bribed by the Mitchell family." In other words, they needed to avoid them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow pondered for a while and said, "It won't be difficult, but the Mitchell family will probably find out about this if I help you. The Barlow family will probably have a falling out with the Mitchell family when that happens."</p></div>
