        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> No! Don't!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She wanted to shout, but as soon as she opened her mouth, water kept rushing in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina! Tina!" Chandler shouted, trying to jump into the water, but his tall body was firmly held back by the approaching police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Then several police officers pressed him to the ground together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina!" Chandler struggled, desperately looking up, but could only watch his beloved sinking and floating in the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina had never seen Chandler so miserable before. Hmm, if only she had a camera now, she could capture this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because it showed how much he loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This moment, Tina couldn't help but think in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But, it's fine like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although he looked miserable, at least he wouldn't rush into the water and sacrifice himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even if she were to die, she still wanted him to live well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But what about when he's in pain?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But before she could think further, another wave came crashing in, completely submerging her in the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina lost consciousness completely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And the last sound that entered her ears was Chandler's heart-wrenching cry of "Tina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> ------------</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A wedding turned into a separation of life and death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit found out about this several hours later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After finishing shooting for the day, his expression instantly turned desolate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Today was Tina's wedding day, and she must have looked beautiful in her wedding gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> These days, Emerald City was flooded with news about the wedding of the two families, but he deliberately avoided looking at these news, afraid that he would become even more jealous and resentful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If... he had known Tina since childhood, would some things have changed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But now, nothing can be changed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Kit, something big happened!" The manager approached Kit and shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What could be so big? Did something happen to the original advertisement we were supposed to shoot?" Kit said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's Miss Stephenson!" the manager said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit's body suddenly stiffened. "What happened to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It seems like she's been kidnapped, and when the police tried to rescue her, there was an explosion. Unfortunately, there was a reservoir nearby, and it burst open, causing the water to rush in and sweep her away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The manager spoke about the information he saw online. Although some details may not be accurate, one thing is certain: Tina was swept away by the water, and her life is now in danger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The color drained from Kit's face as he looked at the manager in disbelief. "Are you telling the truth?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "How could I joke about something like this?" the manager said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit quickly took out his phone and checked the latest news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Sure enough, there was news about Tina's uncertain fate, appearing in the trending topics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> His fingers trembled as he clicked on the news and read the report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the next moment, Kit had already grabbed his car keys and rushed towards the parking lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Hey, where are you going?" the manager shouted from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit didn't bother to answer him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Moments later, a car had already sped out of the parking lot, heading towards a distant place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The manager watched the car disappear into the distance and muttered, "Could Kit be going to the scene? I hope he doesn't end up in the news as well!"</p></div>
