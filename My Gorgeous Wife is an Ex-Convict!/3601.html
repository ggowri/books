        <h1>Chapter 3599</h1>
        <div><p>But her next words made him breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s your grandfather&#x27;s illness that you&#x27;re worried about, right? I think he&#x27;s doing okay mentally, and the doctor also said that his physical condition is good. He just needs to stay in the hospital for a few more days and then he can come back,&quot; Jasper said.</p><p>He paused for a moment. Did she think... he was playing the piano so late at night because he was worried about his grandfather?</p><p>But it was fine, at least he didn&#x27;t need to come up with any more excuses.</p><p>So William nodded and said, &quot;I... am worried about my grandfather.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay, don&#x27;t worry! Otherwise, I&#x27;ll have my dad find some specialists from Emerald City to come and consult with your grandfather?&quot; she said, as if comforting a child, and patted his head.</p><p>&quot;No need for that. Since the experts from Deer Capital said there&#x27;s no big problem, it should be true.&quot; William let go of Jasper&#x27;s hand and placed it on his cheek.</p><p>Her warm palm made him feel at ease.</p><p>&quot;Jasper, thank you.&quot;</p><p>She chuckled, &quot;What are you thanking me for? I haven&#x27;t done anything to deserve your thanks.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just being by my side now is enough for me to thank you,&quot; he said.</p><p>Thank her for being there at this moment, which prevented his emotions from getting out of control.</p><p>Without her, perhaps his emotions would have been even more shattered at this moment.</p><p>She smiled and said, &quot;Okay, it&#x27;s getting late now. Let&#x27;s go back to our rooms and sleep. I want to go to the hospital to see my grandpa again tomorrow!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay,&quot; he replied.</p></div>
