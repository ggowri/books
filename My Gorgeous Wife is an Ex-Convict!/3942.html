        <h1>Chapter 3940</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, a man like him wouldn't be so easily seduced by a woman. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been her turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to go to a hotel?" Nancy gathered her courage and asked bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, if she wanted to verify it, this was the quickest way. If she could really make him interested in her with her body, it was worth a try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For her, there was nothing left to lose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She just wanted to give her mother justice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A hotel?" Mick raised an eyebrow. "So, are you planning to have sex with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm." She answered, her ears turning red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the first time she had ever made such an invitation to a man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air became silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Nancy began to worry that the other person might think she was too casual, Mick's voice suddenly sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Huh? She looked up and blinked her eyes, okay what?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her somewhat dumbfounded expression, Mick couldn't help but curl his lips. "I said okay, let's go to a hotel room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An hour later, Nancy stood in the luxurious hotel suite, still a little dazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She...really went to a hotel room with Mick?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this man the type who casually goes to hotel rooms with women? If so, then what about those rumors?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So now, how are you going to prove it?" Mick looked at Nancy with a smile that wasn't really a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A nervous feeling pervaded Nancy's whole body. "I...I'll go take a shower first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, she hurriedly ran into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick raised his eyebrows, interested in the fleeing figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it was she who took the initiative to suggest coming to the hotel, she was also the one who was now scared and nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And him? Why did he agree to it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because he also wanted to know what kind of feelings he had for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy spent quite some time in the bathroom before finally walking out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she looked at Mick sitting on the couch browsing through his phone, she felt as though the scene before her was like a beautiful oil painting, strangely captivating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Done?" He lifted his head to look at her, as if sensing her gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I'm done. Do you...want to take a shower too?" She said, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure." He was more relaxed than she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Mick went into the bathroom, Nancy relaxed a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the soft, large bed in the room, the thought of what she and Mick would do on it later made her face turn red again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was she really going to sleep with Mick?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What if he wasn't satisfied with her later...what would she do then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Also, as an inexperienced beginner, would she make mistakes if she was too nervous?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her only knowledge in this area came from her health class and some scenes from movies and TV shows she had watched before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, those shows only hinted at things and didn't have any "real" scenes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, Nancy regretted not watching more adult films before. If she had, she might have known more ways to tease a man and wouldn't feel so lost now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mick came out of the bathroom in his bathrobe, he saw a half-empty bottle of XO cognac on the coffee table, and Nancy holding a glass, drinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The alcohol content of XO cognac was quite high!</p></div>
