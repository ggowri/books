        <h1>Chapter 1578</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a hint of laughter in Jason's dark eyes. He gently pulled her hand and said, "You're not allowed to be interested in other men. I'm the only man you can be interested in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was momentarily dazed. He was still as overbearing as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back then, he did not like her to be close to other men too. He would overbearingly tell her to only look at him and think of him... Come to think of it, it was sweet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, there was a slight pain in Grace's earlobe. She suddenly came to her senses to find Jason nibbling her earlobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She trembled and felt the blood rushing to her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, stop it..." She trembled and unconsciously raised her hand to cover her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before her hand could touch her ear, his hand pinned it down. "I won&rsquo;t..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He murmured, sounding as though he was tasting the most delicious food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her face grew redder. "Well... Well, I bought a gown at the boutique today. I spent a lot of money on it. It... It doesn't matter, does it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She spoke quickly, trying to stop him while also distracting herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If this goes on...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since I gave you the card, it doesn't matter how much money you spend. You own half of the Reed family's wealth anyway," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Aren't you afraid I'm only after your money?" she joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you?" he asked in a deep voice while he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The amorous air seemed to have frozen as silence enveloped them. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if he wanted to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's throat instantly felt a little dry. "No,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He chuckled. "I know you're not. There wouldn't have been so many problems between us if you were." After a pause, he spoke as he played with her fingers, "I heard from Terrence that you ran into Irene Lynch in the boutique today. Did she piss you off?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "She pissed Lina off, but I probably pissed her off in the end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You don't have to worry about her. Just treat her as a nobody that the Reed family is keeping around. If you find her annoying, I'll order her to never show up before you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "It doesn't matter whether she shows up in front of me. What matters is her showing up before you. Don't tell me you can't see that she's trying to use her daughter to get you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm not interested in her. She's just Oriel's mother. The Reed family promised to raise Oriel until she's an adult and not separate the mother and daughter," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not that he had no idea what Irene Lynch was up to, but to him, it was like watching a clown. He did not have any sort of feelings for her at all, so he was not bothered to deal with her as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But don't you think you're giving her some hope by doing this? You're making her feel like she has a chance to get what she wants," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then what do you want me to do? Disfigure her? Or make her spend the rest of her life in the hospital so that she won&rsquo;t dare to overthink things anymore?" asked Jason.</p></div>
