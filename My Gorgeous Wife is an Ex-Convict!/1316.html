        <h1>Chapter 1315</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she looked forward to the future when the children were born. She thought he must be the best father ever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the next few days, Grace needed one progesterone shot every day. However, instead of going to the hospital every day, Jason had a nurse come to the residence to give her the shots, making it much more convenient for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the number of times increased, the pain that came from these progesterone shots gradually increased as well. Even the area on her belly, where it was often injected, was a little bruised. It looked a little horrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, Jason looked heartbrokenly at Grace's belly, which had been pierced with many needles. "Why don't I ask the doctor if there's anything else you can do instead of taking injections?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "No. The doctor would have told us if there was a better way. Besides, it may look a bit scary but it's not that bad. There are a lot of pregnant women who take more injections than me, especially those with in vitro fertilization pregnancies. Some start taking injections from the beginning of pregnancy and continue until the baby is born."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent. Her belly had already turned out like this when she had only been taking injections for more than a week. He would feel a pang in his heart if she had to take injections until the babies were born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, it really doesn&rsquo;t hurt much." Grace comforted Jason with feigned nonchalance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his head and kissed the needle marks on her belly. Each needle mark was a sacrifice she had made for the kids!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wish I could share some of these burdens," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You accompany me every time I go for the maternity check-ups and the classes. You're already sharing the burden with me," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was far from enough for him. He did not want her to suffer any injuries or pain, but there was no way to avoid it. She could only bear these.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace's phone suddenly rang. Grace answered the phone when she saw that the caller was Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's voice came from the other end of the line. "Grace, it's so late now... I'm not bothering you, am I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah, no. I haven't slept yet," replied Grace, thinking Kyla Corbyn's voice sounded a little strange. "Kyla, what's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Kyla Corbyn, who was on the other end of the line, took a deep breath and then said, "You don't have to help me with the custody case anymore. I'm going to give up the custody case against Martin Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Grace was startled. "Kyla, you're giving up? Didn't you want Nelson's custody no matter what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That was before." Kyla Corbyn's voice was full of agony. "But now that I think about it, Nelson will only suffer if he's with me. At least he'll have a bright future if he's with Martin Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, thank you for what you've done for me. I'll go to Martin Weiss and personally entrust Nelson to him! I don't want to make too much of a scene because of the custody dispute and make Nelson bear what he shouldn't have to bear at a young age," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Kyla Corbyn ended the call. Grace stared at her phone, unable to come to her senses for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened?" asked Jason who was beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla suddenly said she doesn't want to pursue the custody case anymore and is willing to give Martin Weiss custody," said Grace, looking puzzled.</p></div>
