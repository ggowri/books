        <h1>Chapter 1366</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was collecting the tickets, Nelson said, "Mommy, can we take more pictures with Daddy today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was stunned for a moment before saying, "I can take more pictures of you and Daddy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want a picture with Daddy and Mommy," the little one said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A picture... together?' Kyla Corbyn was silent. Martin Weiss might not be willing even if she was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson asked dully, "Is it because you and Daddy are divorced so you can't have a picture together? We have someone in our class whose parents are divorced too, but... he has lots of pictures with his parents."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a trace of loneliness on the little one's face as he said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn raised her hand and touched her son's head. After pondering for a moment, she said, "I'll take more pictures of you and your daddy first. Then we'll take pictures together, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." The little one smiled again and nodded his little head enthusiastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her son, Kyla Corbyn sighed in her heart. 'Everything I'm doing today is to satisfy Nelson's wishes, right? In that case, he just wants a picture together... I'll try my best to get that one picture!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was now walking over to them. Nelson naturally held out his hand to his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was a little shocked as he looked at the small hand that was reaching out to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson just wants to enter while holding your hand,&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn explained his son's actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one blinked his dark eyes and he asked with his childish voice, "Can I?" There was expectation and nervousness on his little face. It was as if he was afraid that Martin Weiss would refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss reached out his hand and held his son's little hand. A smile instantly appeared on the little one's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With Nelson in the middle and Kyla Corbyn and Martin Weiss each holding one of Nelson's hands, the three of them now looked like a normal family of three visiting the amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything in the amusement park was new to Nelson. Even though he had been here before, he still seemed to find this place to be full of surprises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Children... are so easily satisfied,' Kyla Corbyn could not help thinking as she looked at her happy son. The more one grew up, the more difficult it was to feel satisfied and the more one desired! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn hesitated when Nelson held her hand, wanting both his parents to go on the merry-go-round with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was one of the more exciting rides that kids Nelson&rsquo;s age could ride. They would sit on wooden ponies while going round and round. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would have been all right for her to play with him if it was before, but she had no idea if her body could stand it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy?" Nelson looked at her longingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Didn't you always say you'd do anything for your son? Can't you even get on this ride with him?" Martin Weiss asked a little sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stiffened. Moments later, she said to her son, "Okay, I'll ride it with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one let out a cheer.</p></div>
