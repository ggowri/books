        <h1>Chapter 2159</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They only saw William standing at the top of the stairs, while Jasper was staring at him with anger and shock. It was obvious that she had witnessed something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace hurried to her daughter's side. "Jasper, what happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper said, "Mommy, I saw William push Nelson downstairs! I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who saw it but Brother did too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could not understand why William pushed Nelson. If Nelson had not grabbed the handrail in time, he would have taken a bad fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had once seen a TV show about a woman who died after being pushed down a flight of stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although her mother told her that everything in TV shows was fake, she still had nightmares about it for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at Mick Reed. "Mick, is what Jasper said true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed nodded. "Jasper and I saw William suddenly rushing out and pushing Nelson when he was going down the stairs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All eyes were instantly on William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's tiny body winced a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, tell me why you did that," Grace said as she looked at William sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's dark eyes looked at Grace, Nelson Corbyn, and finally Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was more fury than confusion on Jasper Reed's face. William opened his mouth but suddenly had no idea what to say. He tried to push Nelson Corbyn away because he heard something shooting toward Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, no one would believe him if he said that, would they?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because he did not have any proof!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked down and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace frowned, turned to look at Kyla, and said, "Kyla, I'm sorry that Nelson's hurt. Why don't I ask the driver to take you and Nelson to the hospital first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes... Yes, let's go to the hospital first," Lina said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla nodded and left with Nelson Corbyn. Grace said to Lina, "Lina, I'll take the kids back first. I'll visit you some other day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure!" answered Lina. Then, she looked at William, who had his head down. "William is still young. Take your time educating him. It should be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I hope so.' She hoped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina did not believe that children with criminal parents would also be criminals just because they shared the same genes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, William pushing Nelson down the stairs reminded her of Lily. Her heart could not help shuddering at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'The child was with Lily for five years. He's not indifferent to human life because of Lily, is he?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Got it," answered Grace before leaving with the children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She first sent Mason and Veronica Barlow back to the He family&rsquo;s house before returning to the Reed family&rsquo;s house with the three children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper was furious and ignored William along the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William kept his head down, his little face pale and panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Back in Reed Residence, Grace asked the butler, Uncle Kwan, to look after her son and daughter. Then, she took William's hand and went to the study with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, tell me why you pushed Nelson down the stairs today," Grace said,</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William kept his mouth tightly shut and said nothing. All he could think about was how angry Jasper had looked just now.</p></div>
