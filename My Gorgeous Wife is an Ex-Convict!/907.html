        <h1>Chapter 906</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though he had ordered his men to stop her, he wanted to see her with his own eyes and ask her what was going on with the child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he actually saw the child, he was surprised for the second time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not expect him to be the child he had met before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had a strange affection for the child and even wanted to sponsor the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I didn't expect... the child to be hers!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss bent down, his deep black eyes staring at the small child in front of him. He looked into those eyes that were similar to his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's... What's your name?" he asked hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson, but it's only a nickname. My full name is Nelson Corbyn." The little one smiled at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw the smile, Martin Weiss finally knew why he had a strange affection for the child. It was because his smile looked like Kyla's!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nelson Corbyn?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where's... Where's your dad?" His voice grew hoarser.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, the little one's happy face immediately became a little sullen. "He's not around anymore. Mommy said Daddy's in heaven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'In heaven?' Martin Weiss picked the little one up and walked up to Kyla who was already pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Give me&hellip; the child," she said with a tremble in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, if you don't want to make a fool of yourself in front of the kid, then come with me now," Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla trembled and gritted her teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words were as if he had sentenced her to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can't I escape?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she tried hard, she still could not escape and even led him to discover Nelson's existence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to yell and hit someone. She wanted to take Nelson out of his arms, but she could not say anything when she looked at her son's innocent face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The world of adults was ugly. At the very least, she hoped Nelson's world was a little cleaner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright. I... I'll go with you," she said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson listened on as if he understood what was going on. "Mommy, where are we going? Aren't we going to take the train?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good boy. We're... going somewhere with this man. We're... not taking the train for now. We'll take it next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about Grandma? Won't Grandma come with us?" the little one asked doubtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could not help looking in the direction where Mrs. Corbyn should be right now. "No... I'll call Grandma and tell her we'll take the train next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was sad that he could not take the train today, but because he met the uncle who once helped him recover his hearing aid, he joyfully and excitedly told Martin Weiss about how he could hear and how well he could speak now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss also interacted with Nelson and would answer some of Nelson's questions while Kyla, who was listening beside him, had mixed feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want the child at all, yet now, he was patiently talking to the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How ironic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A car was already waiting outside the train station. Martin Weiss's subordinate who followed him here opened the door to the backseat.</p></div>
