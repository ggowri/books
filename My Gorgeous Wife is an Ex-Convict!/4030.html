        <h1>Chapter 4028</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick had told her that he loved her, and after spending time with him these past few days, Nancy no longer had any doubts. She knew that he truly loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what about her? Could she love him? Her physical condition was a mess, and her future, as well as the baby's, was uncertain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she made a promise to him now, would that be too selfish?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, Nancy would rather Mick not love her. At least if something happened to her, he wouldn't be affected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fetus in her womb wouldn't make it to full term and would have to be delivered by caesarean section at 32 weeks, according to the doctor's evaluation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But 32 weeks was only 8 months, too early for Nancy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can I hold on and wait until 35 weeks to deliver the baby?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Fowler, if you wait until 35 weeks, your physical condition will be even worse, and your condition will become more uncontrollable," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's only three weeks, I can hold on!" Nancy insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A 32-week-old baby is still too small, especially since the lungs have not fully developed, which can cause many complications.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this time, every extra day the baby stays in the mother's womb is worth more than a week outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least waiting until 35 weeks would be safer for the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, listen to the doctor, 32 weeks!" Mick said. "With medical advancements today, even if the baby is born at 32 weeks, survival is guaranteed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I'm afraid that if the baby comes too early, even if they survive, if certain parts haven't developed properly, it could affect their entire life. I want to give the baby more assurance," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew she was being greedy. The baby could already survive, but she wanted to give them more assurance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But have you thought about what would happen if you were to have another episode like last time, unconscious for 16 hours or even longer?" Mick held back his fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat by her hospital bed, watching her unconscious state, afraid that if she didn't wake up, what would he do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, his heart was filled with despair and sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, she eventually woke up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But no one could guarantee how long it would take for her to wake up if she were to lose consciousness again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick, let me hold on a little longer, okay? If I really can't hold on, then we'll have the baby delivered!" Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick tightly pursed his lips, staring at her. "Do you really want to hold on? Is it because this baby is the only family you have and the most important thing to you, and I... don't count for anything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, he meant everything to her. He was the one she loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the man she deeply loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you... love me?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy didn't know how to answer him for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Love, of course she loves him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if she responds, wouldn't that be another kind of restraint for him? He doesn't know what her and the child's future holds, and she doesn't want to say the word 'love' because she can't promise him anything for the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hesitation made him bitter. "So it turns out that I was just being foolish. You never loved me! Even if I begged you, you would still risk your life for the child in your belly! You never thought about what would happen to me if something happened to you!"</p></div>
