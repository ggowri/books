        <h1>Chapter 1103</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Grace suddenly opened her eyes and sat up in bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nightmares? Nightmares again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gasped, and a low elegant voice rang in her ears. "What did you dream about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace jerked her head up and caught sight of Jason's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "No-Nothing! Why are you in my room at this hour?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I couldn&rsquo;t sleep," he said, lifting his hand to dab the sweat from her forehead with a tissue. "You're sweating a lot. More than when you were receiving treatment for your hands during the day. Did you dream about your time in prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stiffened immediately, and her eyes widened in surprise as she stared at him. 'He... knows?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were stammering when you were asleep, so I figured it out," he said. It was because he had partly figured it out that he felt even more guilty when he saw the helpless and pained look on her face when she was asleep. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Grace smiled wryly. She had been nearby and heard him calling for his father and mother the last time he fell asleep with a fever. This time, it was the other way around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just dreamed about my time in prison. I always have dreams like that, but I feel much better now," she said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together lightly before suddenly saying, "Did you start sleeping with the lights on again after we broke up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was silent. She could turn off the lights and go to sleep when she was at Reed Residence. However, she had to turn on the lights to go to sleep again after breaking up with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not go to sleep if the lights were turned off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace did not answer, Jason already knew by looking at her expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she was the only one who could make him utter these two words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, she did not know how to respond to these two words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's late, you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can I sleep here for the night?" he interrupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze. "Sleep here for the night?" 'Is it... Is it what I think?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "I'll just hold your hand. Don't worry, I won't do anything else to you until you fall in love with me. It's just hard... to sleep in that room by myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the wall was full of her photos, it only made him want to come to her even more frantically. He would be satisfied just quietly watching her sleeping face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly thought of Jason's insomnia. It seemed that only during the two days when he had a fever did he sleep well because of the medicine. At other times... it seemed as if she had hardly ever seen him sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few minutes later, even Grace was surprised that she agreed to Jason's request and let him stay in the room. However, she would sleep in her bed while he slept on the floor beside her bed. One of his hands held one of hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene reminded Grace of the time when she and Jason first met. They used to hold hands and fall asleep like this in the rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis." He suddenly called her that way again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned only to hear him continue, "Remember when we were in the rental house and you said we'll huddle each other for warmth? That I'll cherish you, and you'll cherish me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought that even if we broke up, I could keep you as my Sis and let you stay with me, but... It turns out keeping you as a sister still doesn't work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whenever he saw her with Brian, he would be so jealous that he would lose control of his emotions and lose his cool.</p></div>
