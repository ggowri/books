        <h1>Chapter 3124</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, what's wrong?" Brian asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes were getting redder, her nose was runny, and her voice was choked up as she said, "I...I'm fine...but...how could you cross the street like that just now? There's no crosswalk here, and if a car was speeding and didn't see you, what would you do? Do you know how dangerous that was?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, tears couldn't help but fall from her eyes. "Brian, how could you be so careless about your own safety?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt sorry for her and used his sleeve to wipe away the tears on her face. "I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I was wrong. Please don't cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tears made him feel extremely uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You...of course you were wrong!" Valda sniffled and swung her small fist as if venting her anger, hitting Brian's chest. "Do you know how worried I was about you just now? I was so afraid...so afraid that a car would hit you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, I was wrong, I was wrong!" Only she could make him apologize so humbly. "Please don't be sad anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you...can't just cross the street like that again in the future." She sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When crossing the road, you need to... need to look at the traffic lights and follow the traffic rules..." she continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay!" he obediently replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is she treating him like a three-year-old?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Valda stopped crying, and Brian breathed a sigh of relief, feeling that this was more stressful than negotiating a multi-billion dollar deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened to you earlier? I couldn't reach you on your phone," Brian asked, which was why he rushed over in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was in a taxi that got rear-ended, and my phone happened to fall under the seat. When I picked up my phone, I found that it was blacked out, so I thought I'd take another taxi to your company," Valda explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you get hurt anywhere?" he asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it was just a minor fender bender," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked relieved, "When the phone suddenly cut off earlier and I couldn't reach you, I was really scared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, his body trembled uncontrollably, his mind went blank, and his body instinctively ran out of the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I am afraid that something unexpected might happen to her, and I am afraid that he might not be able to see her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I am extremely afraid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda stared at the man's pale cheeks in front of her, and there was a thin layer of sweat on his forehead. "I'm sorry for making you worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda murmured as she lifted her hand to help wipe the sweat off the other person's forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she finished wiping off that layer of sweat and was about to retract her hand, he suddenly grabbed onto it and said, "In the future, please don't make me worry like this again, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyelashes trembled slightly as his lips landed on the back of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face immediately turned red and she stammered, "There are so many people here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her blushing face and knew she was shy, so he said, "Let's find a place to eat first. After we finish our meal, we can go buy you a new phone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I just need to fix my phone. Besides, I haven't had it for very long!" she hurriedly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you can do it however you want," said Brian.</p></div>
