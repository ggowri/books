        <h1>Chapter 1964</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fat teardrops rolled down her cheeks, chin, neck... and into her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The salty hot tears seemed to instantly wake Hadwin Stephenson up from his impulsiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His body instantly tensed as he panted to look up at her face full of tears. His hoarse voice was almost squeezed out of his mouth. "Don't... come near me again. At least... not tonight! Otherwise... I don't have the self-control not to touch you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once he finished, he seemed to push her away with all his might and went upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina stood in place in a daze. She looked at the figure that quickly disappeared from her sight. It took a while before she finally came to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her body was still trembling instinctively, and his last gaze on her was full of lust as well as... restraint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if he was trying so hard not to touch her and hurt her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What happened to Hadwin? Why is this happening?' Lina had a vague idea in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, with one hand on her torn dress, she hurried up the stairs to his bedroom door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His bedroom had been locked from the inside, presumably because he did not want to let her in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could only knock on the door and ask, "Hadwin, are you okay? Shall I speak to the butler and have a doctor examine you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What responded to her was silence. Sometime later, she heard a hoarse voice from inside. "I'm... fine. I don't need... a doctor..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He spoke every word with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina pursued the matter again, all he said was, "Stop... talking. You're making it... harder... for me to get through this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina did not speak again but quietly stayed at the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson had no idea how he spent the night. It was as if he had been hollowed out. This was how his mother treated her own son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the sun shone down on him through the curtains, his eyelashes quivered slightly and he slowly opened his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had not been in such a mess for so long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He took a change of clothes and went into the bathroom, letting the warm water wash over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What happened yesterday played back in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Yesterday... he almost lost control and hurt her and the baby in her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, a warm current seemed to surge through his body at the thought of her. His body still wanted her even though the drug should have worn off by now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Ruthlessness flashed across Hadwin Stephenson's eyes as he thought of his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed that he had been so accommodating to his mother that she thought he could be pushed around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was no longer a child and his mother's pawn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson washed up, got changed, and opened the room door but was suddenly dumbfounded.</p></div>
