        <h1>Chapter 3490</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The kidnappers have all been caught," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Lionel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason said, 'He is currently being detained at this police station.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pursed her lips tightly. Although she knew that Lionel was involved in this matter, even if he was not the mastermind, she couldn't ignore the fact that he was her own brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she usually can't stand Lionel and doesn't have any affection for her stepmother, she still doesn't want Lionel to actually commit any serious crimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, the police will investigate everything thoroughly," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." Veronica nodded and then looked around the room. "Is this a hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, the doctor examined you. Although you have some bruises, they're not serious. You'll stay in the hospital overnight for observation. If everything is okay, you can be discharged tomorrow," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Jasper? How is she? Is she also in the hospital now?" she asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's in the next ward," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to go see her," Veronica said. She needed to see her with her own eyes to feel at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nighttime now. Maybe she's already asleep. You can go see her tomorrow morning. Besides, she has fewer injuries than you. What could happen?" Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica then noticed that it was already pitch black outside the window!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must be hungry. I'll have someone bring you the prepared porridge," he said and then pressed the bedside intercom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, someone brought over hot porridge and small dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eight small dishes, paired with the porridge, were refreshing and appetizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The doctor said that if you wake up, it's best to have some light porridge first," he said, carefully helping her up from the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was about to get out of bed, but the next moment, Mason had already picked her up horizontally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" she exclaimed, "I can walk by myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He simply picked her up and placed her on the chair by the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person holding the porridge left the ward, leaving only Mason and Veronica inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He carefully scooped up some porridge and gently blew on it to cool it down before offering it to her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was a bit dazed until his voice echoed in her ear, "What's wrong, Veronica doesn't like to eat this?" Only then did she come to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No." She quickly replied, opened her mouth, and took a spoonful of porridge. "I can manage on my own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, your hand seems to be injured, so let me feed you instead," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, your hand..." Her gaze fell on his fair hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, his hands are very clean, which is completely different from his bloody hands when he was beating the bandits earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, his hands were pulling and suppressing her, making her feel unable to resist. But it was also these hands that knocked down the kidnappers and saved her from their grasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you looking at my hand for?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are your hands okay? Did they get hurt?" she asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," he said. "Is Veronica worried about me getting hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile immediately appeared on his face, innocent and pure like a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she looked at his smiling face, she couldn't help but freeze. His smile and the way he looked at her made her feel like she was the most precious treasure in the world.</p></div>
