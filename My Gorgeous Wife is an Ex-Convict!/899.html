        <h1>Chapter 898</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It was only her last attempt at taking advantage of my remaining affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, she was wrong, I have no feelings for her at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, I have no feelings for her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss once again said to himself, 'But why... did the day she hurt herself keep appearing in my mind these days?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It&rsquo;s as if she refuses to have anything to do with me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I've finally found her, and if I never saw her again&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only felt his heart throbbing with pain again as he thought of this. 'I haven&rsquo;t gotten my revenge. Only a few years in prison isn't enough!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Persuading himself with this argument, he picked up his phone and made a call. "It's me. Get someone in Emerald City to keep an eye on her. Inform me if something's wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I won't allow her to disappear from my sight again no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even in hell, she hopes to never meet me again. However, I won't let her get what she wants!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving Kyla's place, Chase Harper drove Grace back to the rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the way, Chase Harper asked, "Are Nelson and his family really moving to G City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought I could visit Nelson more often in the future," said Chase Harper. He liked Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just because we're in a different city, it doesn't mean we won't meet again," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, a car suddenly came from the other side of the road and approached Chase Harper's car. They were clearly forcing them to stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's going on?" Chase Harper turned the steering wheel quickly while stepping on the brakes. He abruptly stopped the car by the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was now angry. He unbuckled his seat belt and said to Grace, "I'll get out of the car and see what's going on. It's probably some rich kid driving recklessly!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper recognized that the car that stopped them was a limited edition Bentley, which probably cost more than ten million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before Chase Harper could get out of the car, Grace suddenly took hold of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was shocked. She usually kept her distance from him and would never have any physical contact with him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper turned to Grace who was sitting in the passenger seat and found her staring at the Bentley in astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had already recognized the car as Jason's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, that meant... The one in the car was Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her pupils immediately shrank. Then, she saw the figure who got out of the driver's seat. It was the Reed family's driver!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver walked up to Chase Harper's car and respectfully tapped on the passenger door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened the door with a stiff hand. The driver said to Grace, "Miss Cummins, Mr. Reed would like to invite you to his car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed?" Chase Harper looked on strangely before asking Grace, "Do you know the man in the car?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I not?' Grace took a deep breath and said to Chase Harper, "I'll go over. You can go home first. Don't worry about me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then unbuckled her seat belt.</p></div>
