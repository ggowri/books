        <h1>Chapter 575</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was somewhat amused. This fellow no longer seemed interested in the autograph and posters of Howell Webb she had always wanted. Instead, when it came to her friend, she cared more about her than anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She cared so much that it made him a little jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When would this girl care a little more about him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me!" Lina could not help but urge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's in it for me if I tell you?" Hadwin said lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's in it for him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked her eyes in confusion. Uh, what good could she do him? She could not just slip him a few banknotes or give him a copy or two of Howell Webb's posters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just give me a kiss," He said casually, just to see how she would react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the woman immediately cupped his face and gave him a big kiss on the cheek. "Come on, tell me!" She was not shy at all. Consequently, her actions made Hadwin feel a little uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to at least blushed a little when he let her kiss him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she had somehow skipped blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin had no choice but to clear his throat in front of Lina's expectant eyes. "Evelyn has dragged Brian into the mire. She wanted to plot against Grace and used Brian as cannon fodder. Do you think a man like Brian would stand it? Besides..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin paused there and did not go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides what?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. Just know that Evelyn's place as Brian's girlfriend has come to an end. That's all," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he did not say was that Brian's attitude toward Grace was clearly a little unusual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, since Grace is already Jason's girlfriend. It's unlikely she and Brian have any chance together,' thought Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the incident had gone viral for a couple of hours, another video took over the internet by storm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The video was a surveillance video that clearly showed Evelyn grabbing Grace's hand and then suddenly letting go and falling backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The video featured an expert that analyzed the situation; judging from the angle shown in the video, as well as the amplitude of both parties, it was impossible Grace could have pushed Evelyn that far with almost no amplitude in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expert even built a model of how much body swing it would have taken to push Evelyn to where she had retreated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expert was really an expert&ndash;a nationally renowned physicist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many even wondered why such a well-known expert would pay attention to gossip posts, even going through the trouble of analyzing the video and creating models.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he merely said lightly, "I don't want to see anyone wronged for nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, the internet was in an uproar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who had been wronged and who was the wrongdoer seemed clear enough after the expert's analysis of the event.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, those who had been scolding Grace suddenly turned their firepower toward Evelyn. In response, Evelyn's fans tried to turn the situation around, but it did not help much.</p></div>
