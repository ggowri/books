        <h1>Chapter 1241</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips tightly as he approached Grace step by step. His dark eyes were staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of avoiding his eyes, she looked straight into them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, he raised his hand and held her in his arms. "Grace, I'm trusting you this one last time. Just once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would trust her to do what she just swore she would do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather than him believing her, he wanted to believe her and that what she said would come true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace leaned in Jason's arms, taking in his familiar scent. He was willing to believe her. Did that mean their marriage could go smoothly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how much faith he still had in her, at least he was willing to believe her for now, and that was a good thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick sent Brian back to his mansion, but Brian did not want to enter the mansion. Instead, Brian stood at the mansion&rsquo;s gate and fell into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick had no choice but to stand with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man&rsquo;s dark phoenix eyes stared at the space beneath his feet. It was where Grace had stood that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Brian felt an unspeakable pain in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never expected so many things to happen after not getting out of the car that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace is... the little girl who saved me when I was a child! It can't be wrong. It must be!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His intuition had recognized her the first time, but he did not believe it. He believed some superficial evidence instead and thus missed her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, how long are you going to stand here?" Patrick could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can go. I want to stand here all night," whispered Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All night?" Patrick was shocked. "You haven't even recovered. Are you trying to kill yourself by standing here all night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not answer, but his tall body remained standing where it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick could not help but sigh to himself, knowing that what had happened today greatly impacted Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was tormenting himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was contemplating whether to knock his friend unconscious and drag him into the mansion. Suddenly, Brian asked the security guard nearby, "Tell me everything she said and did during the whole night she stood here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guard was stunned. He understood who Brian was referring to. After all, the woman was the only one who stood here all night until dawn. She left after Young Master Hart avoided seeing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The woman just stood here. She didn't look for a place to sit down or buy anything to eat or drink. But she did make several calls on her phone. She seemed to be asking about a loan, but she looked pretty disappointed when she finally got off the call," the security guard said.</p></div>
