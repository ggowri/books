        <h1>Chapter 2248</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would leave Neal Reid behind when that happened. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the office door was pushed open and the secretary said, "Chairman Weiss, Mrs. Weiss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary paused, and Kyla, who was behind the secretary, widened her eyes at the scene before them. Her face was full of shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jacqueline Bowman... and Martin Weiss? What are they...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of the door opening made Martin Weiss snap back to his senses. Then, his eyes met Kyla's shocked gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He immediately froze and tried to stand up. "Kyla..." However, he just realized that Jacqueline Bowman was practically clinging to him when he moved. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned and mercilessly pushed Jacqueline Bowman away. Then, as if afraid Kyla would misunderstand, he hurried forward and said, "Kyla, it's not what you think. I... I have nothing to do with her. I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the head of a corporation. He was not afraid when facing influential figures but was incoherent when facing a frail pregnant woman. His handsome face was full of nervousness and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;m not here for anything else. I just came here to let you know that Nelson's school is having a parent-child event this weekend. You can join if you're free," she said. She could have made a phone call or sent a text message to tell him this, but she could not stop herself from taking a taxi to his company after taking a taxi back to the store. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know why either. 'Was I afraid that something might&rsquo;ve happened to him, so I wanted to see him for myself?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect to see such a scene upon her arrival. It even made her feel a tightness in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla wanted to leave after she finished speaking. Martin Weiss reached out to grab her, but she turned sideways and dodged his hand. "I'm leaving." She said a simple sentence and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked blankly at his empty hand. 'She won't even let me touch her anymore?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary who had opened the door was worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The president had specifically told her that if Mrs. Weiss came to see him, she should let Mrs. Weiss in no matter what he was doing. Therefore, she brought Mrs. Weiss into the office without informing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who knew they would come across such a scene?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman felt a little smug. God's plans superseded her own. It was a good thing that Kyla saw that. That way, Kyla would have more problems with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she would be able to swoop in!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman stepped forward with a worried look on her face and said, "Oh, Mr. Weiss, could Kyla have misunderstood something? Why don't I talk to Kyla? Don't worry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She reached out to touch Martin Weiss's hand as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the moment she touched him, Martin Weiss suddenly waved her hand away. "F*ck off!" Martin Weiss snapped at her, his cold gaze making her shudder.</p></div>
