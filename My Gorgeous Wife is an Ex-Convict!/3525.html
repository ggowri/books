        <h1>Chapter 3523</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica arrived at the Reed family's mansion to meet Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at Veronica with some concern, "Veronica, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine," Veronica said. "Jasper, when will Mason... see me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason... will come down in a moment. Veronica, as long as you explain the misunderstanding to Mason, everything should be fine," Jasper comforted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica smiled bitterly. She used to think that way too, but their encounter in court changed her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even felt that Mason had already shut her out of his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Mason appeared on this side of the stairs shortly after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked up at Mason as he walked down the stairs step by step. She quickly stood up and approached him, saying, "The court rushed things. Can you give me some time to talk things over?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure." Mason Grace responded calmly, then walked ahead towards the main entrance of the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing this, Veronica quickly followed in Mason's footsteps, while Jasper watched their departing figures with a hint of worry on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until his phone rang with a video call that Jasper snapped out of his thoughts and answered the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the screen of his phone, William's face appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The trial is today. Everything went smoothly, right?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, everything went smoothly," Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did Mason come back today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, he did, but... Mason seems a bit strange," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Strange?" William looked puzzled. "In what way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well... it's like he's treating Veronica like a... stranger. Actually, not really a stranger, but it's just not like how he used to be with her. The way Mason looks at Veronica, it's like he's looking at someone he doesn't really know," Jasper explained after some thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William also found it strange. "Maybe Mason is still angry with her," he suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hopefully so," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll have a few more court hearings on your end, right? I'll come to Emerald City in a couple of days," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Jasper replied. "But actually, if you're busy, it's okay if you don't come. There shouldn't be any unexpected developments in the court hearings anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I want to come," William said. "I want to be by your side, see you in person, instead of just through video calls on the phone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, his expression was incredibly serious, and his gaze made Jasper's heart beat faster, even through the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What's wrong with her? Why does she feel her heart beating so fast when he says those words?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, on the other side, Veronica followed Mason out of the main house and all the way to the Reed family's ancestral hall, where Mason finally stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you remember when I told you the story of my grandparents?" Mason suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Veronica was taken aback for a moment, then nodded and said, "Yes, I remember."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you should also remember how my grandfather died," his voice continued to ring out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," she responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because being abandoned by the person you love, you lose the motivation to live and would rather freeze to death in the icy wilderness," Mason murmured, his gaze shifting towards the entrance of the hall. "Once, when I found out how my grandfather passed away, I didn't understand why someone would choose death instead of living."</p></div>
