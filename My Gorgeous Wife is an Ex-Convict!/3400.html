        <h1>Chapter 3398</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although you are still a child, you are the future heir of the Quentin family. Therefore, you must understand that every word you say in the future will not be a child's play. Since you won't regret this matter, it's even better. As for the girl from the Hart family, although her mother's background is not great and she has a limp, the Hart family is still worthy of our Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, he didn't know why, but when he heard his mother say the words "lame leg", he felt a strange discomfort. In his mind, he saw the swollen face of Harley flash by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I wonder if that little one will get angry again if they hear these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His leg is lame because he saved someone. He traded one leg for a life," he couldn't help but say these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the fight, he heard from others that the woman from the Hart family had a limp leg because she had jumped into the river to save Jasmine, the daughter of the Reed family. She almost died but survived, but her leg never fully recovered because she missed the opportunity for timely treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's rare to see you speak up like this. Are you speaking on behalf of your fianc&eacute;e's mother?" said the mother with a hint of sarcasm, and then left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, with the signature and seal on the marriage certificate, Harley's status in the Quentin family is officially confirmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, they should be together forever, Lornell thought to himself in this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does that mean I should also call you Lornell?" Harley asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of "Lornell" made Lornell's eyebrows furrow and her body tremble. She asked, "Why are you calling me that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But doesn't Tina always call Chandler 'Chandler'?" the little one said naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So... did she learn by imitation? Lornell continued to furrow her brows, and on her pretty little face, she rarely showed such a bitter and resentful expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, it all comes down to that guy Chandler, who started things off on the wrong foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't like it when people call me Lornell," he said, scrunching up his face and feeling uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why don't you like it? I think Lornell sounds nice. You can also call me Harley," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He paused for a moment, then realized that his name and hers were actually antonyms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's true, just like their personalities, they were completely different. If it weren't for that explosion, they might have never seen each other again after the amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was lost in thought and didn't say anything for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his silence made her think he agreed, and she suddenly hugged him excitedly, "I knew you would agree. Lornell sounds nice. From now on, you can call me Harley, and I'll call you Lornell!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell was caught off guard and was hugged face to face. He instinctively wanted to push Harley away, but when he raised his hand, her hand, still stained with red ink, grabbed his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The red ink and the firm grip reminded him of the scene when she held his hand tightly during the explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had heard from people around him about the scene when he and Harley were rescued. She was already unconscious, but she still held his hand tightly. Even the rescuers had to spend some time separating their hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And there were still bloodstains on his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought it was his blood at first, but later found out that it was Harley's blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, was the blood on his hand from Harley?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The red ink was like the blood from back then.</p></div>
