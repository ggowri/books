        <h1>Chapter 1198</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was Stella trying to use Chase Harper to pit her against Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What should she do to persuade Brian to let go of his hostility toward Chase Harper?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe she should try again and find a chance to talk to Brian one-on-one to explain the whole story...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After thinking about it for some time, her phone rang and interrupted her trance. Grace picked up the phone, and Kyla Corbyn's voice sounded from the phone. "Grace, what&rsquo;s going on with Chase Harper's incident? Nelson keeps asking about Uncle Harper these days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's difficult. I'll think of a way and see if I can find evidence to prove his innocence," said Grace. The odds were slim, but she would try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If there's anything I can do, let me know," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, " replied Grace. After ending the call, she realized she had unconsciously walked to Reed Group's office building!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered coming here many times before, especially when she was a rider in Kyla's small restaurant. There was a time when Jason liked to order a bunch of lunch boxes for her to deliver at noon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no idea why she would unconsciously walk here. What was going on with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to turn around and quickly leave, but her stomach felt sick again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost unconsciously, she leaned against a small trash can on the side of the tree-lined street and began to throw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had also thrown up profusely when she saw Jason last time. Unexpectedly, she was throwing up like this again when she got to his company's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled wryly to herself, but the vomit came in fits and starts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A security guard came over and said to Grace with a look of disgust on his face, "Why are you puking here? Our president's coming back to the company later. If you throw up like this, it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace trembled a little. Jason was... coming?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I... I'll leave at once," Grace said with difficulty, her mouth full of the sour taste of vomit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could pull herself together, the sick feeling returned and Grace threw up into the trash can again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guard was secretly worried. Although the trash can was a little far from the main entrance and was at the tree-lined street, things would be bad if the president saw this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could do nothing while she threw up! The security guard could only stare anxiously, expecting the woman to leave quickly after she finished!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, you could not always get what you wanted. While Grace was still throwing up, three cars suddenly drove up to the building&rsquo;s entrance. The cars stopped, and someone got out of one of the cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed, it's Miss Cummins..." Terrence's voice paused and he did not continue speaking. After all, Grace had become taboo to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, who was throwing up, immediately froze when she heard Terrence's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Terrence was here, then Jason should be...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not stop vomiting right now. Grace could only keep her head down and vomit, feeling as if she was about to throw up her whole stomach.</p></div>
