        <h1>Chapter 4330 Meeting Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for quitting, he didn't think Harley would do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she has loved him for so many years, hasn't she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When liking someone has become a habit, it is unlikely to happen to change this habit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Lornell thought confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I don't know, sometimes like this kind of emotion, it can also be completely cut off overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley didn't expect to see Calvert again like this, and similarly, he was being beaten again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just this time, the person who beat him was not a student on campus, but someone outside the school, and the other person also loudly said, "You had better ask your father to repay the money quickly, otherwise I will beat you once every time I see you in the future. Don't blame me for being cruel, blame you for being his son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert, with his hands protecting his head, curled up and pressed his fists again and again. </span><span>He was used to this kind of beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's father likes gambling and owes a lot of money. Those creditors who cannot find his father will come to him and beat him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these people also know that he is just a student and doesn't have much money, so they won't do anything else to him except for beating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So just endure for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the other party has played enough, then he can go home... back to the home that suffocated him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, he heard a crisp female voice: "Stop it! I've already called the police."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This voice appeared in his dreams during this period!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert suddenly looked up and couldn't believe the figure standing nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's Harley!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The princess of the Hart family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did she appear in front of him again, even though both parties had only a brief contact and he could no longer touch someone like her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like the last time, when he was beaten, she came out to stop him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, report to the police? You're so nosy, so I'll let you know what's the end of being nosy! "The man who was originally beating Calvert looked at Harley with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley glanced at Calvert, who was lying on the ground and looked coldly at the middle-aged man. "If you don't get out now, I'll let you know what you're going to end up with," he said</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! You go quickly, leave me alone! "Calvert was anxious, and in such a chaotic place, the people here could do anything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That dark side, a princess like Harley will never understand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the man was about to walk towards Harley, Calvert ignored the pain and grabbed the other person, saying, "She has nothing to do with this matter. If you want to hit her, just hit me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other party raised their feet and tried to kick Calvert away, but they insisted on stopping the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if you get kicked once, you will stand up and stop again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at the scene before him and felt a strange feeling in his heart. He immediately ordered, "Come out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, two men in black suits suddenly appeared next to Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let this person take a lesson, don't hit people like this again in the future! "Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! "The two responded, walking towards the man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene stunned Calvert and the man!</span></p></div>
