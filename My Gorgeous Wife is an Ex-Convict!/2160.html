        <h1>Chapter 2158</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was curious and envious when Kay talked about her boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Um, how would it feel to have a boyfriend? Would it be like what I see on TV?' Although she was only in the first grade, she knew what a boyfriend was. After all, it was all on TV.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then don't like someone else," Mason's smile faded again as he spoke sulkily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How is that possible?" Veronica Barlow rejected right away, not noticing Mason's eyes dimming slowly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William squatted in the corridor for an unknown length of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Even though I left the room, no one noticed. Even... Jasper didn't come out looking for me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is it because I'm nobody important?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Maybe Jasper only finds me interesting because I play the piano and a lot of kids can't play the piano or keep up with her. That's why she wanted to play with me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But if she meets someone she likes better, I&rsquo;ll be cast aside like now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Will it be like what the servants' children said? If she loses interest in me or gets bored with my piano playing, she'll get rid of me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As he was thinking, he suddenly heard footsteps behind him. It was Nelson Corbyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked blankly as Nelson Corbyn walked over. He looked gentle and spoke softly, just like the prince in Jasper's storybooks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn noticed William too. He walked over and asked, "William, what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"N-Nothing," William said stiffly. He did not like Nelson Corbyn, but for some reason, he did not hate him either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Aren't you going in to see the baby?" Nelson Corbyn continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked down and ignored him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn smiled and said nothing more. He turned and walked toward the stairway nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, William's ears twitched as he raised his head as if he had heard something. Then, he darted toward Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, Nelson Corbyn dodged instinctively. However, he lost his footing and fell down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Thump!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, Nelson Corbyn grabbed the handrail of the stairs. Even so, he had fallen several steps!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was a cry of surprise downstairs. Kyla hurried over and helped her son get up. "Nelson, what came over you? How did you fall down the stairs? Are you okay? Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn clenched his teeth in pain for a long time before catching his breath and saying to Kyla, "Mom, I'm fine. I'm okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace also rushed over. "I think you'd better go to the hospital to check it out. A fall like that might be serious. Some wounds might not be obvious, but it might be too late when there's something wrong!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla replied in acknowledgment. She was about to take her son downstairs and go to the hospital when a childlike voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, why did you push Nelson downstairs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All eyes instantly turned to the top of the stairs.</p></div>
