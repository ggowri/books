        <h1>Chapter 473</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him with a puzzled expression on her face. "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you thought about how you're going to introduce me later?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback but quickly replied, "Of course I'm going to introduce you as my boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled. "All right, let&rsquo;s go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting out of the car, Grace approached the door and knocked on it. Shortly after, someone answered her. It was Third Aunt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Third Aunt saw Grace, her expression became a little sarcastic. "It's you, Grace. You&rsquo;ve even brought a man with you this time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt glanced out the door as she said so and noticed the ordinary car parked in front of the house. Almost instantly, she looked at Grace with something like a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They all thought that her niece had hooked up with a rich man. After all, a man had exaggeratedly saved her from the fool's house that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, looking at the car parked outside, it did not look like a luxury car. Additionally, Third Aunt was capable of recognizing most fancy cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man beside her niece looked pretty good but what was the point of being good-looking? He could only be ornamental!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the man most probably did not know that her niece had been to prison before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I've come to see Grandma. How's she doing?" replied Grace. She had heard that First Uncle, Second Uncle, and Third Aunt were taking turns to take care of her grandmother. Since Third Aunt answered the door, it had to be Third Aunt's turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your grandmother is capable of eating and sleeping like normal. She's currently sleeping in her room," said Third Aunt. As they talked, the three of them reached the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt's daughter, Stella Lindsay, was seated in the living room, cracking sunflower seeds and watching a TV drama. Stella Lindsay had wanted to tease Grace as soon as the latter arrived. However, the former&rsquo;s eyes lit up, and she could hardly look away when she saw Jason standing next to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned to Jason and said, "Why don't you stay here while I go over to my grandmother's room to see her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Jason before he gracefully took a seat on a chair. His posture did not show restraint but did not come across as rude either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around and headed for her grandmother's room, while Stella Lindsay looked hard at Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought that the man looked like a portrait just by sitting there. However, just as she was about to open her mouth to try and talk to Jason, she became intimidated by the invisible sense of alienation he exuded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was like someone she could only admire from a distance and could not get close to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to her grandmother's room but did not cross paths with her grandfather. In the room, her grandmother was seen lying on the bed fast asleep. She looked thinner compared to the last time Grace saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the elderly lady in front of her, and for some reason, she felt as if her grandmother already had one foot set in the grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was because her grandmother was getting old. Even if her memories of her grandmother were full of spirit and vigor, now that the years had gone by, especially after having a bout with an illness, no one knew how many years her grandmother had left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, since her grandmother had been given one more year to live, she should cherish her time with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After watching her for a while, Grace silently exited the room, not wanting to disturb her grandmother's sleep; she could wait until her grandmother woke up to have a good talk with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace returned to the living room, she found Jason sitting in a chair, idly playing with his phone.</p></div>
