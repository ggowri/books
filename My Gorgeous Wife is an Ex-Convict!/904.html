        <h1>Chapter 903</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My father asked you to announce the wedding date. This way, it'll show you're sincere," said Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright," replied Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would do whatever she wanted him to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then we'll lead the first dance when it's time," added Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," responded Martin Weiss. Suddenly, the phone rang. He picked up the phone, frowned at the caller ID, and said to Paisley Daniels, "I'm going to take this call. I'll be back soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he walked to a secluded corner of the banquet hall and answered the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the contact number of the man he sent to Emerald City to keep an eye on Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He probably called at this time because something was going on with Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, once he answered the phone, his expression changed abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only heard him say, "President Weiss, Kyla is leaving Emerald City. She bought the train ticket for 3.45 PM and..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's not alone," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was a little confused. 'Not alone? What does he mean? I remember that she has a mother who disappeared with her when she got out of prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she with her mother?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She has a son." What he said next was so shocking that he could barely hold the phone in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did you say?" His voice could no longer hold its composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She has a son who looks like he's about three or four years old," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Son? She has a son?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss just felt his mind go blank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"President Weiss, do you want me to stop them or let them leave Emerald City?" he asked. After all, once he let them leave Emerald City, it would take a lot of effort to find out their whereabouts again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the lights in the banquet hall slowly dimmed as the music began to play. Paisley Daniels went to Martin Weiss's side, trying to get him to finish the call and lead the first dance with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had specially arranged for the reporters to take pictures of them dancing together to show off online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as they announced the wedding date, those netizens who once said that she endured so many years without marrying into the Weiss family could finally be shut up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could speak, she heard him say to the other end of the line, "Stop them! Don't let them go! I'll be right there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, the man who was supposed to lead the first dance with her rushed straight to the exit of the banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin!" she shouted, lifting the skirt of her gown to catch up to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not run fast with her high heels on. In the blink of an eye, Martin Weiss had rushed out of the banquet hall, leaving Paisley Daniels behind with all the guests' eyes on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels could only feel her face burning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should be at her best today, but now, it was her worst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reporters she invited were desperately trying to capture the way she looked at her worst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's parents had now rushed to their daughter's side, urgently asking, "Paisley, what's going on? Why did Martin leave?"</p></div>
