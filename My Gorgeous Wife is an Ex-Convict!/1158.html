        <h1>Chapter 1157</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about I ask Lina to figure out a way to transfer Nelson to another kindergarten?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, everyone in the kindergarten probably knew now that Kyla Corbyn had been to prison. Nelson would probably be discriminated against if he continued to stay there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had gone through such an experience before and did not want Nelson to go through the same thing! Since they could not change the environment there, what they could do was make the changes on their side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla Corbyn did not answer Grace's suggestion. Instead, she asked, "What are my chances if I want to reverse the case now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and thought carefully for a while, then gave Kyla Corbyn an answer. "30%."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gave a wry smile. 'Only 30%... A 30% chance that the case can be reversed?' However, ordinary people would fight even if there was only a 10% chance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was too low for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because it was a long time ago. Some of the evidence in your favor is gone, so the judge will refer more to the testimony of the witnesses even if we want to reverse the case. However, we have every chance of finding new evidence. If we study the case carefully, we'll get a 30% chance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace spoke. She had studied Kyla's case and found that there were some loopholes in it. If she tried to exploit those loopholes, they would have a chance of winning, and if new evidence could lead to a chain of evidence, the odds of winning were even higher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, if we file the lawsuit, it's possible that they'll publish news about it online. Journalists will pay close attention to the case reversal, and Nelson may even be harassed, right?" said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated for a moment. "We can only try our best to avoid these things. There's no way to control them. After all, Martin Weiss is quite popular."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gave another wry smile. "I see, let me think it over again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they filed the lawsuit, losing would only reinforce the belief that she deserved her sentence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That would hurt Nelson even more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the witness... Unless Martin Weiss could rectify and give his testimony in her favor, her case would not be 100% reversed. Instead, it would only attract public attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace left, Kyla Corbyn looked down at her sleeping son with remorse in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson got hurt today because of her. If she had thought of reversing the case earlier or if she had been more vigilant and less naive, she would not have to bear the guilt and let Nelson suffer the pain of having a criminal mother at this age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't the doctor say Nelson's injury isn't serious? You don't have to worry about it," said Mrs. Corbyn. She was afraid her daughter would blame herself too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, did I do something wrong?" murmured Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do something wrong? What did you do wrong?" Mrs. Corbyn asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... shouldn't fight for Nelson's custody like this. Once it goes to court, the press will probably come. Then the press will magnify the fact that Nelson has an ex-convict mother and... it'll become a burden that the child will never be able to get rid of," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she feared and hated to see the most was Nelson getting hurt because of her!</p></div>
