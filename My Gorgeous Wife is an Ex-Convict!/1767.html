        <h1>Chapter 1765</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The patient, who had made fun of Dr. Russell earlier, was dumbfounded by this scene. It felt like he was watching something from a TV show and almost could not snap back to reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, he heard Dr. Russell shouting, "Jason, what happened to the girl? It has only been a few days and her hands have turned out like this. I think it's meaningless to treat these hands now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jason?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The old patient was shocked. He knew someone in Emerald City with that name, but... no way. There was no way he would come to a small clinic like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, what Jason did next surprised the old patient even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He saw the man named Jason kneel in front of Dr. Russell. "Dr. Russell, please save Grace's hands. She&rsquo;ll be left with too many regrets if her hands are crippled!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She would need them for her law career and to hug their children...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If her hands could no longer feel or move, she would never be able to caress his face or gently rub his hands to keep him warm...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason held Grace in his arms. Though she was a little dazed by the pain, she knew what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With much difficulty, she said to Jason with her eyes half-open, "Jay... It's... It's okay... Even if these hands are crippled... I... I can take it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>She did not want to see him kneel for her. A proud man like him should never kneel!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The men who followed Jason into the consulting room were secretly surprised when they saw the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Young master Reed was kneeling for a woman. Few people would believe it even if they told them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, another man rushed into the consulting room. It was Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Brian saw Jason kneeling in front of Dr. Russell, he instantly realized that Grace's hands must be a lost cause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With a thump, he fell flat on his knees in front of Dr. Russell as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Dr. Russell, Grace&rsquo;s hands became this way because she was trying to save me. You have to save her hands no matter what! I beg you. Please at least give it a try!" pleaded Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The eyes of the old patient instantly widened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knew Brian. 'He&rsquo;s the crown prince of the entertainment industry who&rsquo;s often on the news! Is he kneeling in front of Dr. Russell for this woman too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell sighed. "Get up. I'll give it a try. But it's up to God whether she can keep her hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Half an hour later, the old patient walked out of the small clinic in a trance. He was still a little shaken up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He recalled how he had just joked about Dr. Russell not knowing any big shots when those two figures suddenly barged in and knelt in front of Dr. Russell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Thinking about it, the old patient felt as if he had been slapped in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But who is that woman in Jason's arms? How could she make both Jason and Brian kneel in front of Dr. Russell for her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The old patient was curious and could not help wondering. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell treated Grace while Jason and Brian were forced to stay outside the consulting room.</p></div>
