        <h1>Chapter 641</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed was silent. He had raised the child himself, but he still could not control him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was growing old while the child was growing stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You really are... Becoming more and more like your father." Old Master Reed looked at his grandson with mixed feelings. He still remembered that his son had also said to him that he must marry that woman. It did not matter even if he needed to give up his status as the Reed family's young master.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if everything the Reed family had was nothing to write home about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his lips together and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then Old Master Reed added, "You'll regret it one day, just as your father did..." However, it was all too late and Jason&rsquo;s father lost his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't regret it. Falling in love with her and marrying her is the last thing I'll ever regret," said Jason with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Haha..." Old Master Reed suddenly started laughing. "You won't regret it... That's easy to say, but I'm already old and I've got one foot in the grave. Maybe I'll die before you regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then live longer," Jason stared at Old Master Reed as he said, "May you live a long life so you can see how much I don't regret it. Maybe you can see the birth of mine and Grace's baby. That should be fun,&rdquo; Jason said, loosening his foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary whom he had been stepping on finally felt that he survived a disaster. He quickly stood up and looked at Jason with a look of fear as well as alarm. Then, he asked Old Master Reed, "Are you all right, Old Master?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed shook his head and looked at his grandson. "Do you really want me to live a long life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Jason smiled. The previous rage in his bright and amorous eyes had faded. He looked noble and elegant as if his cruelness earlier did not exist at all. "Grandpa, may you live a long life so that you can see that my father and I are different, and... How happy I&rsquo;ll be!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Jason left the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was loneliness in Old Master Reed's expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Live a long life?' He looked at his old hands. He was already old and his health was deteriorating every year. Even though he had been recuperating in the hospital for a long time, he could not resist the natural process of aging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, can I live a long life?" Old Master Reed asked the secretary in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary hurriedly replied, "Of course, you can live a long life, Old Master."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well then, let me see if he's the same as his father," muttered Old Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, Grace asked Jason for his opinion as she held the bridal booklets Terrence sent over in the afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"These are some designers who are a little famous. If you have any other designers you like, you can name them and I'll ask someone to get in touch with them," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A little famous?' Grace was speechless. 'These are some famous designers!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, the designers here are pretty good," Grace said quickly, "However..." She bit her lip somewhat hesitantly.</p></div>
