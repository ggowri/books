        <h1>Chapter 2421</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Jasper wants to stay in Deer City for a few more days, doesn&rsquo;t she? Since that's what she wants, it's better to fulfill her wish. As for the kindergarten, I'll make a phone call and ask Uncle Kwan to ask for a leave of absence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But what about your work?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "I can make conference calls for now. The others can be handled through fax and computer. Since the Mitchell family has found out, why don't we take the opportunity to sort out Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s matter as soon as possible? That way, you can return to Emerald City sooner as well. I don't want you staying in Deer City alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze and immediately understood that the real reason he wanted to stay in Deer was not that his daughter wanted to stay longer. It was because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if we can't sort out this Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s matter in a short time? After all, it's still unknown where the Mitchell family has transferred her to," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll be able to find out where Amber Mitchell is in three days tops," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How is that possible? Philip Barlow says it's unlikely we'll find Amber Mitchell anytime soon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's if the Barlow family is looking for her alone. It's unlikely they'll find her soon. But if we cooperate with the Barlow family, we'll find her within three days&mdash;unless the Mitchell family has sent Amber Mitchell out of Deer City. I'll look all over Deer City in these three days," Jason said affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they were back at the hotel, Jason took care of the two little ones while Grace went to Kyla's room next door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she found that Kyla's eyes were red when she saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? What's making you uncomfortable?" Grace asked hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'm fine," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, where's Martin Weiss?" Grace looked around the room and realized that Martin Weiss was not in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He went out to take care of something," said Kyla. She did not tell Grace that Martin Weiss left the room because she had slapped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just went to the Barlow family&rsquo;s house. Philip Barlow said that Amber Mitchell..." Grace told Kyla the news she got from the Barlow family today and that she would try her best to find out where the Mitchell family had transferred Amber Mitchell to within three days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla was still uneasy, "Will they take Amber Mitchell..." She was afraid that Amber Mitchell would not be able to protect herself if the Mitchell family harmed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "At least not in the short term. They&rsquo;ll probably announce to the public that Amber Mitchell was transferred to another hospital to get better treatment." It was to stop them from visiting Amber Mitchell again. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Mitchell family seemed to think that delaying the matter a little longer would put it to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla breathed a sigh of relief and looked gratefully at Grace. "Thank you for helping me. Though... I&rsquo;m here, I can't seem to do anything. I just stay in the hotel almost every day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Just take good care of the baby and wait for the news. Besides, it's not just me. Martin Weiss is helping you too even though he doesn't talk about it. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to enter the hospital and see Amber Mitchell so easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes dimmed at the mention of Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened between you and Martin Weiss?" Grace asked as if she had sensed something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. Nothing happened between him and me." Kyla forced a smile. "I should be glad nothing happened. Him not having any affection for me is exactly what I want, isn't it?"</p></div>
