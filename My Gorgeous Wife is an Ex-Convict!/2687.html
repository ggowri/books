        <h1>Chapter 2685</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'In that case, it makes sense... why that executive assistant named Estelle Rowe would come to the film set and help Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But how did Valda get into a relationship with Brian? These two are like people from two different worlds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'There's no love in Brian's eyes when he looked at Valda. Why would he date Valda?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The old mystery was solved, but a new one was added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman continued to look through the information he received. The more he looked, the deeper his brows furrowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, Brian did not love Valda at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After putting his phone down, he restarted the car and sped toward Third Hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was taken to Third Hospital's emergency room, and the doctor examined her. Unfortunately, it was only some skin trauma. There was no major bone injury or concussion, but she still needed to stay in the hospital for observation for one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor prescribed some medicine. Estelle Rowe asked her subordinate to collect it and help Valda Theller go through the admission procedures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland looked at the bruises on her best friend's face and felt heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt?" Camille Strickland asked. Then, she sobbed. &ldquo;Of course, it hurts. How could it not hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were so many bruises on her face, not to mention her body!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Those scumbags! How could they beat you like that in front of everyone? And that director. Couldn't he tell if it was real or fake? He deliberately did that to please Queenie Mack and let her vent her anger!" Camille Strickland snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller comforted her. "Okay, I'm alright now, aren't I? Besides, Assistant Maggie also got me a single ward. I've never stayed in a single ward. It feels like staying in a hotel. It's pretty great."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said, "Do you want to stay longer? But do you really not know Assistant Maggie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller shook her head. "I don't know her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why would she help her if you don't know her?" Camille Strickland asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know either," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know anyone in Hart Group?" Camille Strickland speculated again. Assistant Maggie said she was Hart Group's executive assistant to the president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Hart Group's president. She remembered that he was the crown prince of the entertainment industry. 'His surname is Hart. Bri</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wait, Hart?' Brian's face appeared in Camille Strickland's head. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, Valda's boyfriend also has the surname Hart. Could the two of them...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the ward door was suddenly pushed open, and a figure rushed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda!" Raymond Bowman panted as he looked at Valda Theller sitting on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was wearing a hospital gown. The bruises looked more obvious on her pale face. Even one of her cheeks was swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I..." he said with difficulty. The bruises on her face looked like they were condemning him silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here, Raymond Bowman? Don't you think it's disgusting to shed crocodile tears?" Camille Strickland scolded as she lunged forward and stopped Raymond Bowman.</p></div>
