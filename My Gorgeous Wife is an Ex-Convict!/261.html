        <h1>Chapter 260</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not foresee that the next time they met, he would no longer be just Jason, but rather Jason. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect him to remember something she had said back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace... Who is he?" Andrea asked, staring at Jason in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man who looked regal and elegant was Grace's&hellip; friend?! It was strange to think that this was possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace spoke, Jason said, "Is this woman going to set you up on a blind date? Didn't you tell her you already had me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea gasped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man... Was he Grace's friend? Maybe even... her boyfriend?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His appearance alone could beat Sean, not to mention her associate professor boyfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, Andrea looked at Tyler Barber. Originally, she had been quite satisfied with her boyfriend. Although he was 10 years older than her, he was an associate professor. He could be a professor in a few years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, compared to Grace's&hellip; friend, Andrea suddenly felt that her boyfriend was not that presentable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was now stunned by Jason's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tyler Barber took the initiative to say to Jason, "My girlfriend didn&rsquo;t know that her friend has a boyfriend. Sorry about that. My name is Tyler Barber. This is my girlfriend, Andrea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My name is Jason." Jason, on the other hand, simply gave his last name and left his first name out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tyler Barber did not care about it and said, "Mr. Reed, I'm truly sorry for causing this misunderstanding. Why don't we all find someplace to sit down and have a chat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Jason replied. He then said to Grace, "Let's find a place where you can sit and drink your milk tea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a little strange. Jason was not a sociable person. Why did he agree to sit with the others?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the meantime, Jason had taken her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Eventually, the four reached a cafe. Tyler Barber offered the menu to Jason and Grace. "You can take a look and see what you want to order."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The coffee here is pretty good." Andrea introduced as if she was the host. "The coffee beans here are carefully selected by the cafe owner. The most famous one is Hawaii's Kona. There are fewer and fewer Kona beans these days. You used to love coffee, right? Do you want to try a cup of Kona?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her eyes and lightly said, "No, I'm fine with my milk tea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Jason glanced thoughtfully at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're afraid that the coffee is too expensive, my boyfriend and I will treat you this time. It's just a cup of coffee anyway," Andrea said it nicely, but it was obvious that she was just showing her superiority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled and said, "Grace wants milk tea, so I'll try the cup of Kona instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course... Sure." Andrea almost fell for Jason's smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly gathered herself together but was jealous that Grace's boyfriend was so handsome. How on earth did Grace find a boyfriend like that after losing Sean?</p></div>
