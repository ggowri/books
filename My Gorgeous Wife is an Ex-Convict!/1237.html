        <h1>Chapter 1236</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's wearing the same clothes as in the photo, and Jason...' Brian looked past Grace and saw Jason who was sitting in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door was not closed, so he could see Jason wearing the same white suit as in the photo he had seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Step by step, Grace walked toward Brian until she was two steps in front of him and stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you stop the car to see me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you and... Jason register for a marriage license today?" Brian asked huskily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" The word was almost forced through his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm pregnant. It's Jason&rsquo;s." Compared to Brian's agitation, Grace was calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face immediately turned pale, and his eyes fell on her belly in disbelief. 'Is she really pregnant?' He had thought that maybe Jason said that just to irritate him, but the reality was hitting him hard now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman he loved the most was already married to another man and was even pregnant with his child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he used the baby to force you, I can&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before he could finish speaking, she interrupted, "Jay didn't force me. I did it willingly! I married him of my own accord!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Willingly...' A pain shot through Brian's heart. He only found the word harsh to his ears. "Do you love Jason?" he asked as he took a step closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. Up till now, even she could not tell whether she still loved Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her feelings were now fragmented. Could she put them back to the way they were?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said quickly, "You don't love Jason, right? In that case, how can you say that you were willing? I can help you. If you don't want to marry him, then I can set you free."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt the urge to smile wryly. She had hoped that he would help her and stood all night at his mansion's entrance. He had been her only hope at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that hope eventually turned to despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he said he wanted to help her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said slowly, "Bryn, this will probably be the last time I call you Bryn. I won't call you that anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly froze. There was doubt and surprise in his phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The name... Bryn. He had only ever wanted to find the little girl who saved his life and hear the girl call him Bryn again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then he found Stella, and she was not what he had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella had lost the self-reliance and yearning for justice that she had when she was a child. Instead, she was vain, materialistic, and only wanted to be a star.</p></div>
