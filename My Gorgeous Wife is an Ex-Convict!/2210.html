        <h1>Chapter 2208</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's expression instantly sank. "Nothing to do with him? You're even carrying a child for him. How could you have nothing to do with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The baby's mine alone. I'm not carrying it for someone else! I have nothing to do with that man. Whether you believe me or not, it's up to you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman snapped. "You... I wanted to treat you to a meal out of kindness, but you said such a thing. What's the matter? Do you think you're superior because you're being shuttled around by a three-million-dollar car? But what have you gotten out of it? This store? How virtuous do you think you are? You're just an ex-convict!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Jacqueline Bowman picked up her bag and left. Witnessing Jacqueline Bowman's angry departure, Mrs. Corbyn could not help asking, "What happened? Is your friend leaving just like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe we just share different ideas," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since they did not share the same views, it would be difficult to be friends with each other. They might as well leave it at that. Perhaps they could retain what little left of their good impressions for each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman drove away. However, she saw another parked car not far away as she drove off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That car... was the same car that picked up Kyla yesterday. The window of the backseat was rolled down, and the man in the backseat was looking in the direction of the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That man is...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's hand trembled, and the car almost swerved to the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person in the car was Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman had attended an exchange conference with the wealthy businessman, Neal Reid, who was keeping her as his mistress. At the conference, leaders of large business groups like Martin Weiss were always the stars of the show. People like Neal Reid were only minor characters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid had tried pulling some strings to know Martin Weiss but failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Martin Weiss the man behind Kyla? Is Kyla Martin Weiss's 'lover'?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the thought of the possibility, Jacqueline Bowman's scalp tingled and her heart beat violently! If that was true, perhaps Kyla would be more than just a former inmate to her. She would be an... opportunity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla thought Jacqueline Bowman would never come looking for her again after leaving angrily. However, Jacqueline Bowman returned the next day bearing gifts. She said apologetically, "I'm sorry, Kyla. I'm so sorry about yesterday, and I didn't mean to say that. I just lost my head for a moment. I took care of you in prison, so you won't mind it, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I heard that you offended a big shot when I was in prison. Did they give you any trouble after you were released? Do you need help? I can't help much, but I know a lot of people. They might be able to offer help," Jacqueline Bowman said, looking concerned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had looked it up. Kyla had offended Martin Weiss back then. Martin Weiss testified against her and sent her to prison. However, Martin Weiss reversed the case for Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Kyla ran a store, but Martin Weiss would often send someone to pick her up and always appeared near the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Jacqueline Bowman's opinion, the two must be having a fling. However, the relationship was inappropriate, so Kyla would not speak much about it.</p></div>
