        <h1>Chapter 934</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What the hell?! Why didn't you tell me you were hurt?" Lina came to Grace's rental house to visit her best friend but was shocked to see her red and swollen cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It only looks serious. It doesn't hurt much anymore," said Grace. She was embarrassed to tell her best friend that she had looked scarier in the first two days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What the hell is going on? What happened to your face? Who hit you?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then gave a brief account of her kidnapping. Though she tried to play it down, Lina was horrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Towards the end of the story, Lina suddenly said, "Wait, the highway was blocked by the police? Is it the van you were in... the one that the police blocked on the highway that day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Grace was shocked. "What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina took out her phone and searched for the news online before handing it to her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw that someone had posted some photos of the highway from that day online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the photos were taken from a long distance, so they could only see rows of police officers and police cars. The police were heavily armed with their guns pointed at the oncoming van.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene could be described as extremely grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People would have thought they were filming a crime film!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to the distance, the photos were blurry and one could not see the faces of the people in the photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The comments were interesting, with many wondering what the police were doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some speculated that it was an arrest while some speculated that it was a drill. Others even said that it was a counter-terrorism attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no one actually managed to guess what went down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was just joining in on the fun at first. She did not expect it to be related to her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was it Jason who saved you?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He seems&hellip; to care about you. Is there really no secret behind your breakup?" muttered Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's just tired of it. It's like how he only approached me for fun in the beginning and played a brother and sister game. Then, the brother and sister game turned into a game of love. Now, it's back to being a brother and sister game again," Grace said with a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was shocked. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;m now tangled up with him again because of a couple of things. He's calling me &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; again like how he used to call me when we were living together at the rental house," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's this? Isn't he the one who wanted to break up? Why&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't get it either," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Lina looked at her best friend with concern. 'If it&rsquo;s like this, will Grace ever get over her heartbreak?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If a man who dumped Lina were to hang around her all day, she would not be able to stand it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, enough about me. How are you and Hadwin?" said Grace as she changed the subject to a lighter one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're alright," said Lina. Their relationship was getting better, but because she had gone to the underground bar, Hadwin would give her a cold look from time to time.</p></div>
