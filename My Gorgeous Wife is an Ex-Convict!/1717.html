        <h1>Chapter 1715</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, one of the security guards said, "What's going on? Is someone bleeding? Is anyone else injured besides you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Bleeding?' Lina froze. Following the security guard's gaze, she saw a smear of red blood on the steps of the escalator!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The escalator steps were dark gray, so the blood was not that obvious. It was why Lina did not notice it just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'The blood belongs to... Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That's where Hadwin Stephenson fell just now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina suddenly felt something pressing her chest, making her gasp for breath a little. He was hurt but did not say anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she had been more careful, or if he had not been wearing dark clothes, she would have noticed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once she was back home, Lina could not sleep. She kept thinking of Hadwin Stephenson and how they fell earlier whenever she closed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why didn&rsquo;t he tell me about his injury? Does he want nothing more to do with me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Then why did he save me? Why did he happen to be there?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For a moment, all sorts of doubts filled her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she thought it was over between them, he suddenly told her he had always been in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just when she thought she had made it clear to him that it was not going to work, he saved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if they kept getting entangled with each other and could not sort it out no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could not sleep, so she picked up her phone and looked at the time. It was already past two in the morning. She got up and went to the window to open it for some fresh air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she was stunned the moment she opened it. From her window, she could see a figure leaning against a car and looking up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In a daze, Lina looked down at the figure. The moonlight fell on his figure, seemingly covering him with a veil and making him look more cold and ethereal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She even thought that he was only a figment of her imagination and he was not really here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Their gazes met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Moments later, Hadwin Stephenson looked away and opened the car door, looking like he was about to leave. Without thinking, Lina blurted out, "Don't go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her voice was particularly clear in the silent night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stiffened, but he still opened the door and got in the car anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina turned around and darted out of her bedroom. She ran out of the house and rushed downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not know why she was running after him. He had no intention of staying, and she could not possibly catch him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was as if her impulse had taken over her reason at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">By the time she reached the spot where his car was parked earlier, it was empty! It was just an empty lot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He left!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina sighed, feeling a little disappointed. She turned around to go home when a cold voice suddenly rang out behind her. "What's the matter? Are you looking for me?"</p></div>
