        <h1>Chapter Claire Watts</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason rolled his eyes at Patrick. At the same time, Patrick heard some ladies around him puffing and muttering, "Oh my God, he even looks good rolling his eyes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Patrick had the sudden urge to spit blood. Jason had only rolled his eyes. Did those fangirls have to fawn over every little one of Jason&rsquo;s move?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Jason took off the gloves, Patrick seemed to realize something suddenly and grabbed the gloves from Jason's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They seem to be hand-knitted. The knitting isn't very nice, though." Patrick commented on the gloves in confusion. "The wool looks like old wool. Did a store cheat you? How dare they sell you these gloves!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who said I bought them?" Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick's jaw dropped. If he did not buy it, then... "Someone else can't have knitted them for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not answer, but his expression showed that he tacitly agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick felt a little dizzy. Was it really from someone else? With Jason's character, he would never wear this kind of stuff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was not only wearing them today, but he was wearing them in such a public place too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who the hell knitted them?! What kind of person made such... Uh, not so great scarf and gloves, but ones that Jason would wear?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick's mind flickered for a moment with rumors of the woman whom his friend had rescued from a nearby town during Chinese New Year's Eve. He even left Old Master Reed behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even alerted the local police for the woman's sake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be the same woman?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he was lost in thought, Jason stretched out his hand to Patrick and said, "Give it back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Patrick came to his senses and was about to return the gloves to Jason when a voice rang. "Those gloves..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"These are the gloves Jason is wearing today." Patrick went first and said, "Or..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before he could finish the last sentence, Brian said, "They're handmade."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah, you found out," Patrick muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at the gloves, then looked at Jason in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it? What's wrong with the gloves?" Jason asked. He could feel Brian's face changing as he looked at the gloves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are they from someone else?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Jason narrowed his eyes, and they gradually deepened as he looked at Brian. "Have you seen them before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Catching Jason's eye, Brian frankly answered, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, there seemed to be a tension in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick, who was on the side, could not help but yell, "What are you talking about? What have you seen or not seen? By the way, Brian, why didn't you bring your new girlfriend over today? I heard she was throwing her weight around on set today and ended up hitting a snag."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian cast a slight glance at Patrick. "You're well informed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing!" Patrick said humbly. "I just happen to know it from someone who's been gossiping it with me. I heard your girlfriend made some extra kneel and grovel non-stop. Then you gave her a slap in the face in public by carrying the extra straight to the lounge. Why, have you got a crush on the extra? You're getting rid of your new girlfriend?"</p></div>
