        <h1>Chapter 314</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he told her he was a bastard, she smiled brightly. "So what if you're a bastard? You are what you are. There's only one you in this world. What a person can achieve is not based on whether he is born out of wedlock."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you think it's disgraceful that I was born?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She earnestly said, "I think your parents are irresponsible about marriage. Now that they have children, they should get married. If they can't get married, they should have kept their distance or took precautions. Isn't there a saying that getting into a relationship without considering marriage is just sexual harassment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the first time, someone said that about his parents in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she know that sometimes people get into a relationship without considering marriage because there are so many other considerations?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Marriage was nothing more than choosing the woman who could help them make the most of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You get into a relationship for marriage?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course," she answered. "If I want to get married in the future, I'll surely find a man I love very much and someone who loves me very much. We'll love each other forever. Maybe after a long time, that romantic love will turn into family love, but no matter what, he and I are going to stick together and grow old together..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She described to him her idea of love and marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He listened and unexpectedly produced some kind of yearning. He was almost wishing he could have a relationship like that too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always assumed that he was indifferent to his future marriage. If he married, he thought it would be with a woman who could bring him some benefit. Otherwise, he would not marry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his heart leaped at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she were the one he was going to marry... Then he would do it willingly, and he looked forward to the day they would grow old together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like me?" he asked in a deep voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she said as she nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then date me and fall in love with me. Once you fall in love with me, I'll take it as if you&rsquo;ve given me back everything you owe me," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes had a thick layer of confusion. Her drunken state made her head even more incapable of thinking. "Be your girlfriend? Fall in love with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he said, loosening the fingers that were clasped over her jaw. He hesitated when he raised his hand to remove his hands from her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked like she was reluctant to give up the warmth in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was staring at the face in front of her. Suddenly, she put on a bright smile and shouted, "All right!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like a hammer, pounding hard against his heart, making it tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she know the real meaning of the words &lsquo;All right&rsquo;?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he stared at her, her eyelids began to droop. Then, the hands that had been resting on his face began to slide slowly down and went around his neck. "I'm getting a little sleepy. I haven't&hellip; Uh, slept much last night. I'll take a nap now... Wake me up when it's time for dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know whether to laugh or cry. Even now, she still remembered to eat?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Lina fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin pursed his thin lips and finally picked up the person in front of him. He went into his bedroom and put her carefully on the bed in the bedroom.</p></div>
