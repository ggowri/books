        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper quickly grabbed Roger's forearm and looked at his hand. "You're injured!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't a question, but a statement. There were some wounds on his hand, with some places broken and bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just a minor injury," Roger said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper frowned and turned to the taxi driver in the front row. "Excuse me, sir. If you happen to see a pharmacy on the way, could you please pull over so I can buy some medicine?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure!" the driver replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I said it's just a minor injury, no need to make a fuss," Roger said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If a minor injury isn't properly treated, it can still become infected," Jasper said seriously. "Anyway, wait for me in the car and I'll go buy some medicine. It won't take long!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, the car stopped in front of a pharmacy along the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper got out of the car and hurried towards the pharmacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger looked through the car window at the figure rushing into the pharmacy, feeling an inexplicable surge of emotion in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Young man, your girlfriend is really good to you!" The driver in the front row spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's not my girlfriend," Roger replied in a flat voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if she's not your girlfriend, she should still be interested in you. Look how nervous she is about you. As soon as she found out you were injured, she rushed to the pharmacy to buy medicine," the driver said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger pursed his thin lips and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This girl is pretty good. You should cherish her well and don't miss out. You'll regret it in the future," the driver's voice sounded again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's eyes flickered, regretful, but how could he possibly regret it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Jasper had already bought the medicine and ran back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After getting in the car, she raised her hand to hold his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I can do it myself," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your one hand is inconvenient, let me help you apply the medicine," she insisted, took his hand, wiped off the bloodstains with a tissue, disinfected it with iodine, and finally applied the ointment to his wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her movements were gentle and careful, as if she was afraid of hurting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger furrowed his brows slightly and looked at the wound that she had already treated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, this kind of injury was indeed minor. When he was tortured to the point of being unrecognizable, the various wounds on his body made him feel like he was no longer human!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take this ointment back with you and apply it twice a day. Don't forget!" She said, stuffing the ointment into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car arrived at the entrance of Stanford University. The two got out of the car and walked into the campus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger pursed his lips and finally said somewhat reluctantly, "Anyway, thanks for today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're welcome," she replied with a radiant smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she was about to head to her dormitory after he left, she suddenly seemed to remember something. She opened her hand, revealing the tissue she had used to wipe away his bloodstains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the tissue stained with his blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This thing could also serve as a sample for DNA testing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Last time, she deliberately tried to obtain a DNA sample containing his saliva, but despite her efforts, she couldn't get anything. However, when she was treating his wound just now, she didn't even think about getting a DNA sample. But now, she has a tissue stained with his blood in her hand.</p></div>
