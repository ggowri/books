        <h1>Chapter 461</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Seriously, aren't you afraid of embarrassing yourself in a place like this!" said Harold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer angrily said, "I saw her and got so angry. Tell me, does what she just said sound something like what a human would say? She killed Jennifer but is saying that she never harmed anyone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold stared sharply at Grace. "You got out. Whether it was a wrongful conviction is a matter for the court to decide, but when you talk about rights..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold's eyes glistened with disdain as if he was looking at an ant he could crush. "You're not qualified to talk about rights in front of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he said to the security guard beside him, "Kick the woman out and send her picture to the mall's security and management. This woman is not allowed to enter the mall again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guard responded, and Grace was forced out by the man on her right and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My... My things are still on the ground." Since he could say something like this, it meant that the mall was owned by the Atkinson family, or at least, the Atkinson family was one of its major shareholders. That was why they could order the security guards around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she wanted to do now was to pick up the box of pastries on the floor and leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To her surprise, Harold pointed directly at another security guard and said, "Throw this garbage in the trash can. It's an eyesore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guard picked up the box of pastries that was on the floor and threw it into the trash can next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face went red. The humiliation was all too obvious. He was deliberately humiliating her in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, sadly, she had no power to fight back. She could only be kicked out of the mall like an evicted troublemaker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two security guards had dragged Grace to the mall's entrance, they let go of Grace and warned, "Don't make trouble here anymore, or we'll call the police and sue you for causing a disturbance in the mall."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, who had studied law, found it funny that she was now being threatened with it. Her hands that were by her sides were clenched into fists while she gritted her teeth. She looked past the two security guards and through the transparent glass door of the mall, she looked inside...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to tell herself that there was no need to be sad or even bitter about such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more she let her disappointment show on her face, the more likely she was to fall in line with their wishes. Harold and his wife were just trying to embarrass her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps they had their reasons. They thought she killed Jennifer Atkinson, but... she did not! Jennifer Atkinson died unjustly, but what about her? She was also unjustly accused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how many times she told the Atkinson family she was wronged, the Atkinson family gave her nothing but humiliation again and again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a weight upon her heart that made it hard for her to breathe. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to clear her name. She no longer wanted to suffer such accusations and insults because of something she did not do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at the same time, Camelia Meyer seemed to say in resentment, "It seems too easy to just throw her out of the mall!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, then, what do you want to do?" asked Harold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She should at least be locked up for another ten or eight years. How can she already be out? It's too light of a punishment for her! She still has the mood to go shopping while my Jennifer died so young. If Jennifer hadn't died, she would be Mrs. Reed now! Jennifer had such a bright future ahead of her, but she ruined it!" Camelia Meyer said bitterly.</p></div>
