        <h1>Chapter 3158</h1>
        <div><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t stop me... It&#x27;s better to have fun together than alone,&quot; Lina shouted.</p><p>&quot;<span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:13px"><span style="background-color:#ffffff">Valda,</span></span></span> who does she want to have fun with?!&quot; Hadwin rolled his eyes at Lina, but she remained oblivious.</p><p>&quot;Lina got drunk, so I took her back first,&quot; said Hadwin.</p><p>Valda quickly responded, &quot;Be careful on your way.&quot;</p><p>Lina continued, &quot;Valda, next time you come to my house, I&#x27;ll show you the collection of handsome guys posters I have. They are my hidden treasures that I haven&#x27;t even shown Hadwin.&quot;</p><p>Hadwin was speechless. Now, not only did he know about her secret treasure, but also everyone present at the scene knew about it!</p><p>He will go back and search for her hidden treasures, to see whose posters she has collected.</p><p>&quot;By the way... Valda, Kyla, Grace... Next time Valda gets married, we should have a few guys dance together in a group performance. It will definitely be a lot of fun. I&#x27;ll go back and see if I can find a suitable dance track.&quot;</p><p>Lina kept talking about it, and the other men were getting a headache from listening. If they were asked to do a group dance, it would be unimaginably difficult!</p><p>So a few men gave Hadwin a look and urged him to quickly take his wife and leave.</p><p>Hadwin didn&#x27;t plan to stay any longer, &quot;Alright, Lina, let&#x27;s go...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay...let&#x27;s go, let&#x27;s go...&quot; Lina muttered, then turned back to Camille and said, &quot;Camille, I&#x27;ll see if there&#x27;s a suitable match for you. I&#x27;ll help you find someone.&quot;</p><p>Camille quickly thanked her and checked the time. She then said to Valda, &quot;Valda, I&#x27;m going to leave now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Valda replied.</p><p>Then, one by one, the others left with their children. Amber was the last to leave, as her apartment was upstairs.</p><p>As Simon and Valda said goodbye, Simon curiously looked at Brian and asked, &quot;Uncle Brian, will you really dance a group dance with Auntie Valda when you get married?&quot;</p><p>Simon was still very interested in this group dance.</p><p>Brian&#x27;s expression changed slightly, and he gave the little guy two words, &quot;No, but if you want to see a group dance performance, I can find professional dancers to perform.&quot;</p><p>Simon looked disappointed and said, &quot;But I still want to see you dance, Uncle Brian.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...&quot; Brian was speechless.</p><p>The two of them, one big and one small, stared at each other.</p><p>&quot;Okay, let&#x27;s go back now,&quot; said Amber as she held her son&#x27;s hand and left.</p><p>Valda glanced at Brian beside her and asked, &quot;Are you really not planning to dance?&quot;</p><p>Brian raised his eyebrows slightly and asked, &quot;So, do you really want to see me dance?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do want to,&quot; she nodded honestly. &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen you dance before, so I wonder what it would be like when you dance.&quot;</p><p>Her face showed some curiosity, and at this moment, she was slightly tipsy due to the drinks she had earlier.</p><p>She raised her hands and stood on her tiptoes, wrapping her arms around Brian&#x27;s neck. &quot;Brian, can you dance for me? I really want to see you dance.&quot;</p><p>The vague voice, accompanied by the coquettish tone, made him feel a bit helpless.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m not really good at dancing,&quot; he said with a hint of embarrassment.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;m not good at it either! If... at our wedding, you don&#x27;t want to dance, how about you show me now? Just dance for me alone, okay?&quot; She murmured, continuing to act coquettish.</p></div>
