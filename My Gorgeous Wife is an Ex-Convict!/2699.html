        <h1>Chapter 2697</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect this to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick said, "Alright, stop obsessing about it. Stop causing trouble like what you did just now. You and your family aren't going to get away with it if you offend Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was also telling Phoebe Cross not to act recklessly and pick on Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross pressed her red lips together tightly and said nothing else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, someone suggested, "Everyone, Brian brought his girlfriend today. Why don't we play truth or dare? Anyone who refuses to speak the truth must do whatever the winner says. No tricks allowed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd agreed immediately. "Alright, come on. Let's consider it our congratulations to Brian for finding a girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was a little hesitant. She was afraid that she would be asked to complete strange tasks that she could not do. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if noticing her concern, Brian said, "Don't worry. If they ask a question you don't want to answer, you don't have to. I'll take care of the task you have to do after losing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He not only said that to Valda Theller but also to the others. Someone instantly whistled when they heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're so worried about your girlfriend. Are you that reluctant to have your girlfriend do the task after losing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I am," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The private room instantly fell silent again. The crowd was not used to Brian being so frank. Patrick said, "Alright, alright, let's start playing. If the loser doesn't want to do the task, they can ask for help. But you have to complete the punishment task yourself if no one is willing to help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They gathered around and sat. Valda Theller's face was red. Even though she knew Brian was only acting when he admitted being reluctant to have her be punished in the game, her heart still skipped a beat when she heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only tell herself repeatedly that they were only a nominal couple and nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it? What's on your mind?" His voice rang in her ears. She looked up to see his face so close to her that she could even see his thick lashes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Her face immediately turned redder. She subconsciously leaned back and fell backward because she lost balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she saw his expression change. The next moment, he threw himself at her while his big hand protected the back of her head firmly. However, the inertia of her falling backward brought him with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thump!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They fell to the floor together, but he had put one hand on the back of her head and the other on her waist. Their bodies pressed together, and the tip of her nose was full of his scent. It enveloped her like a dense web.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you okay? Does it hurt?" His voice rang in her ear.</p></div>
