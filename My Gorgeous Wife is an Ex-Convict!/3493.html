        <h1>Chapter 3491</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the neighboring ward, Jasper is looking at William who stayed in her room. She blinks and says, "I've already told you, I'm fine. I can manage on my own at night. You don't have to stay with me. If anything happens, I can just ring for the nurse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I promised your parents that I would stay here tonight." said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After learning about his kidnapping, the feeling of fear still lingers in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After learning about his accident, he immediately spent over three months traveling to Emerald City. When he finally saw her appear in front of him, he couldn't control himself and rushed over to tightly embrace her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that only when she is in his arms, he can feel alive again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..." At this moment, a hint of hesitation appeared on Jasper's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Does my staying here with you make you uncomfortable?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper bit his lip slightly and said, "After all, we are of different genders. It might be a bit inconvenient to stay in the same room all night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she grows older, she naturally begins to develop a sense of gender differences between men and women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William raised an eyebrow and looked at Jasper, his gaze making Jasper increasingly uncomfortable. "Why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just thinking, didn't you used to not care about gender differences? Didn't you used to always drag me to your room and even make me sleep with you?" William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's face suddenly turned red, "That...that was years ago, now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about now?" He leaned in slightly, his face close to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face became even redder. Even though she and him were very familiar with each other, and had been close before, his closeness now made her feel her heart racing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She "what about now" for a while, but couldn't say the rest of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He helped her continue, "Now that we've grown up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grown up? She was stunned for a moment, and suddenly her expression became a little sad, "Does growing up mean we can't be like before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's nothing we can't do, as long as you want to, we can always be like before," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Her eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he said, "So, Jasper, we've grown up, if there's anything you feel we need to avoid, I can do it according to what you say. But at the same time, if you want, we can also be like before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even more intimate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't say the last half of the sentence out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That... that tonight..." she hinted with a meaning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tonight, I promised your parents to keep them company through the night, so I can't go back. But if there's anything you're not used to, just let me know and I'll avoid it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She muttered, "Actually... I just feel a bit embarrassed if you see me sleeping. What if I drool in my sleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He chuckled, surprised that it was because of this, "You used to drool in your sleep, but it didn't seem to bother you."</p></div>
