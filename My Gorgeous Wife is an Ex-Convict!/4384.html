        <h1>Chapter 4382  A Different Plan</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some fans back in the day crossed the line with their celebrity obsessions!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was carefully eavesdropping. Those girls were still excitedly discussing what they could do once they got into Calvert's place. They even talked about stealing some of Calvert's items to keep for themselves or to sell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if you get caught by Calvert?" one of them asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's no big deal. I can mess up my clothes and if he tries to call the police on me, I'll just say he harassed me!" said the girl who was planning to sneak into Calvert's place. "As a model who's just starting to rise in his career, he definitely wouldn't want any scandals. So, he surely wouldn't dare to call the police."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true," the others chimed in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, who knows, Calvert might just fall for Janice after seeing her in disheveled clothes. After all, Janice is quite attractive and has a great figure. She could even be a movie star!" someone gushed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that girl named Janice enjoys all this attention.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was confident in her figure and looks, even contemplating whether she should let Calvert discover her tonight, seduce him, and then engage in a sexual relationship with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was simply speechless. Do people think that just because they're good-looking, others will automatically fall for them?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This</span><span> wasn't about gender. Just like before, she had encountered those handsome guys who deliberately tried to tempt her, as if being good-looking meant they could easily get anything they wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And because of this, she found Calvert unique. This man seemed oblivious to his good looks, and it didn't seem like he wanted to use his appearance to gain any advantages.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was a model then, it was only because she had recommended him for the job.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in the modeling industry for a while then, but the sparkle in his eyes remained the same as before, as if untouched by the glitz and glamour of that world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even Harley himself didn't know if he would change in the future. How long could he maintain this purity?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley left the restaurant and immediately gave Calvert a call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Calvert received a call from Harley, he was taken aback, "What's up?" Even his voice was somewhat stuttering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you now?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just about to head home, at the school's parking lot," he replied honestly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you gotten on the bus?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not yet," he said, "but we're almost at the car."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then don't hang up, just get in the car first," Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was a bit puzzled, but he still did as Harley instructed. However, as soon as he used the car key to unlock the vehicle, someone suddenly rushed over from the side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" He almost got hit by the person coming his way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry." A few girls surrounded him, apologizing to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although those girls seemed to be apologizing sincerely, his recent experiences made him realize that they might have bumped into him on purpose!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, he gently said, "It's okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like an interlude. Once he got in the car, Harley's voice came through his phone, "What just happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A few girls bumped into me just now, but it's no big deal," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, after you drive out of the school, wait for me at the intersection on the left. I have something to take care of. We can head back to your place together," Harley said.</span></p></div>
