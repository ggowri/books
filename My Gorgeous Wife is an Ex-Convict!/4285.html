        <h1>Chapter 4283 Encounter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what she said, Tina didn't know whether she should feel fortunate or not. The </span><span>Quentin family's medical skills sounded really high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the art of using Gu worms is already elusive. Can the Quentin family really help Chandler successfully?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, why are you suddenly asking about the Quentin family? Are you thinking of asking the Quentin family to help you regain your memories?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Tina was taken aback. "Can the Quentin family help me regain my memories?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know. I just said it without thinking. But the Quentin family has rules. If they are to save someone outside of their family, that person must be able to provide conditions that satisfy the Quentin family!" Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why they were willing to save her back then was all thanks to Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Lornell was willing to engage with her, making her half a member of the Quentin family. That's why the Quentin family was willing to save her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conditions that satisfy them? Tina hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could really regain her memories, would she be able to remember everything about loving Chandler back then? Would she no longer have this conflicting and torn feeling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or would she be completely disappointed in Chandler because she would know that all his kindness was just a disguise, all with a purpose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, what are you thinking?" Harley's voice rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing," Tina said, lowering her gaze gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it really was with a purpose, a disguise, then why did he voluntarily say during the divorce that he didn't need her to have another child for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't that contradictory?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was thinking about her own affairs and didn't notice that Harley suddenly fell silent, looking towards the entrance of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a group of people entered through the restaurant entrance, both men and women, and the most eye-catching among them was Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lornell, you're really amazing. The surgery you demonstrated today is textbook level. Even the professors praised you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder so many girls in our medical school chase after Lornell. I'm even thinking of chasing after him!" a guy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You give up on that. I think Miss Bird is the most suitable for our medical school. Miss Bird is the school flower of our medical school, after all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop making fun of me!" Eva said shyly, but her eyes clearly glanced at Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone could tell that she liked Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Lornell didn't say anything. Although he didn't agree, he didn't refute either, as if he silently accepted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made those people tease even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley lowered her head, no longer looking at that scene. She felt a bit uncomfortable seeing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All along, although she and Lornell had an engagement, only the close friends and relatives of the Hart family knew about it, and it was never publicly announced. Lornell also never introduced her to those friends who didn't belong to the Crypt families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, she even wondered if there would be nothing between them if they didn't have the engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, isn't that Lornell?" Tina's voice rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was startled and saw Tina looking towards Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, I think he and his classmates from the medical school came here to eat," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This restaurant happens to be near the medical school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to go and say hello?" Tina asked.</span></p></div>
