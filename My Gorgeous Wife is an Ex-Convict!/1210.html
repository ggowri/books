        <h1>Chapter 1209</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, how could I forget? Grace is only doing all this for Chase Harper. Her haggardness, sadness, and persistence are all for Chase Harper!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Drive!" Brian lightly ordered the driver in the front row before leaning back in his seat and slowly closing his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, the driver pressed the button to close the car window and said to the security guard outside, "Take her away. Young Master Hart doesn't want to see this woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately had a look of shock as she shouted, "Brian, I need to see you for something. I want you to help me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, with the car window slowly rising, it cut off her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the security guard nearby dragged her away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car slowly drove away in front of her, Grace almost exerted all her strength to push the security guard away and chase after the car. However, no matter how she ran, she could not catch up. The distance between her and the car just got bigger and bigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella, who was in the car, was secretly pleased to see Grace's helplessness as she chased after the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Grace herself who gave up the identity of Brian's savior, so what was wrong with her using it now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian would only end up being hers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no idea how long she had been running, and even though she ran as hard as she could, the car eventually disappeared from her view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Overwhelming despair fell upon her! 'Who else? Who else can save Lina?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stood blankly on the streets, feeling as if everything around her was turning gray and dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who? Who can save Lina?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could even give up her life as long as she could save Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face emerged in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body suddenly trembled. It was as if hope had sprung up in her eyes that were originally full of despair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was... Jason! Jason hated her now, but... for Lina's sake, she would give it a go anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace arrived at Reed Group's entrance. Reed Group's office hours started at nine o&rsquo;clock, but it was only after eight now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just stayed at the door and waited quietly. The security guard at the entrance dared not say anything after seeing his boss bring Grace into the company the day before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who knows what this woman has to do with the president? Anyhow, she can stand here all she wants!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea how much time had passed. Fewer and fewer employees entered the building. Suddenly, a familiar black car pulled up and Grace's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was... Jason's car!</p></div>
