        <h1>Chapter 309</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you can't settle it by then, just let me know and I'll..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was interrupted by Lina."You've helped me a lot yesterday, Grace. If it weren't for you, I don&rsquo;t think Jason would&rsquo;ve have saved me. I started all this mess with Hadwin. I'll let him let it out on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina put it mildly, but Grace was still worried. Could it be that simple?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, don't worry. Although I left Hadwin without saying goodbye, I didn't kill someone or set fire to him, nor do I have a grudge against him. It was just a... one-night stand. I don't think he'll be too hard on me." Lina reassured her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was already hard enough for her best friend to deal with Jason. She did not want her best friend to worry about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, if you have any trouble, do let me know!" Grace continued. "Even if I'm in no position to help, I can ask Jason. Maybe he'll help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was visibly embarrassed when she mentioned asking Jason for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina knew that her best friend must have asked Jason to find her yesterday. How could she not understand what it meant to ask Jason for help!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was like a nightmare to her best friend. Her darkest miseries were all caused by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the face of her best friend's anxiety, Lina smiled and said, "All right, got it." She only said this because she did not want her best friend to worry. As for the thing between her and Hadwin, she would take care of it herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They continued talking for a while. Grace looked at the time. It was about time for her to go for the interview, so she got up to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Interviewing for a job as a food delivery rider?" Lina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace nodded. "I sent my resume two days ago and got a call for an interview this morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good luck, then! I wish you success," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace left, Lina planned to go to the bus station to take the bus to the parking lot yesterday to get her car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin had taken her away so suddenly yesterday. Her car was still in the parking lot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt a pang of pain at the thought of the parking fee after parking for nearly a day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Money was not easy to earn nowadays. Some time ago, her little design studio said that they would only pay 80% of their salary every month. The remaining 20% would be paid together with their year-end bonus. It was a wage reduction in disguise. It was like pooling 20% of their monthly salary as their year-end bonus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was about to go to the bus station when a car stopped in front of Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina took a look at the car and it gave her the heebie-jeebies. Was this not Hadwin's car? It was the same car from yesterday!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car window rolled down and Hadwin's delicate face was reflected in Lina's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina unconsciously took a step back, trying to keep her distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's eyes narrowed for a moment. Her retreat was only an eyesore to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you want your phone?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him carefully and licked her somewhat dry lips. "Are you going to give it back?"</p></div>
