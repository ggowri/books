        <h1>Chapter 1663</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Watch out!" someone behind her shouted. Then, a strong force pushed Grace aside and she fell to the floor. At the same time, she felt a pair of hands protecting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, she heard hurried footsteps. Her bodyguards and driver shouted, "Young Madam, Young Madam!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace came back to her senses and painfully got up with the help of her bodyguards. "I'm fine," she said and looked back at the man who was standing up. He was dusting himself with his head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This man had just saved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you okay, sir? Thank you so much..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she froze when he looked up halfway through her sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was... Sean!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was Emerald City's socialite, her ex-boyfriend, and the fianc&eacute; of the Atkinson family's second heiress, Lily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Sean was a far cry from the person he was back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was wearing old gray clothes and a pair of dirty sneakers. His handsome face looked old now. There was even a hint of gray hair near his temples.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She remembered Sean being 35 or 36 years old, but he now looked like a man in his 40s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was no longer the dapper and stunning heir of the Stevens family. He now seemed like an underclass burdened by life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Sean realized that the person in front of him was Grace, a look of surprise came over his face. He smiled wryly. "It's you. I learned from the news that you've returned to Emerald City, but I didn't expect to see you under such circumstances."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Grace looked at him and did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean had hurt her so much that she almost tried to commit suicide and lost the courage to love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If it were not for Jay, she had no idea how terrible her life would be right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was Sean who saved her just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll have someone accompany you to the hospital to have a check-up. I'll pay for all the medical bills." After a moment, Grace spoke again, "By the way, you just saved my life. Thank you. Tell me if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her words seemed to make Sean's face flicker with embarrassment. "I saved your life but I don&rsquo;t expect anything in return. I didn't hurt myself, so I don't need to go to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" Grace looked Sean straight in the eye and said, "Thank you, then." She glanced at the broken flower pot and scattered soil after thanking him again. Then, she turned to her bodyguard nearby and said, "Find out what's with the flower pot that fell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," replied the bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, several security guards in the building also heard the noise and ran over. When they saw Sean, they spoke in disgust, "Why are you here again? Didn't I tell you we already have a designated courier? Stop coming here to attract business! Get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One of the guards tried to rudely drag Sean away from the building&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean suddenly seemed to be in pain when the guard was tugging on him and he covered his right wrist with his other hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Go on. Go on pretending!" The security guard thought Sean was putting on a show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said to the security guard, "Let him go! A flower pot just fell from your building and this gentleman saved me! You shouldn&rsquo;t be shouting at him right now!"</p></div>
