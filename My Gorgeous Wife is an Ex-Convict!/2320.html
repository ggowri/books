        <h1>Chapter 2318</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said quickly, "No. That baby is just kicking.&rdquo; The baby had faintly and vaguely kicked before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could clearly feel it this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The baby's kicking?" Martin Weiss was stunned, not expecting this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at his somewhat unexpected expression, Kyla took Martin Weiss's hand and put it on her belly without much thought. "Look, the baby's still moving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened for a moment, and he felt the throbbing against his hand as he pressed it on her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The baby... was indeed kicking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A novel and strange feeling slowly spread along his palm before surging throughout his whole body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's carrying... my baby! This is my baby!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Images flashed through his mind, and they made his eyes darken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The baby stopped kicking, and Kyla had come back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... am I doing? I took his hand and let him touch my belly! What's even more awkward is that... the baby has stopped kicking, but his hand is still on my belly.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face reddened slightly, and her belly seemed to burn hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Thank you very much!" Flustered, she stepped back, took her vacuum flask out of his hand, and hurriedly stuffed it into her backpack. She was ready to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked blankly at his empty palm, his expression changing slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, he walked toward the elevator and said to Kyla, who was waiting for the elevator, "Let me take you back to your hotel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Kyla froze a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had been ignoring her for the past few days, but now... He wanted to take her back to the hotel?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you want to talk? Let's go to your hotel and talk it out," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was music to her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face lit up. "Are you really willing to talk to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think? Why else would I offer to bring you back to your hotel?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elevator arrived. They entered it and came to the underground car park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver was already waiting. He respectfully opened the car door and let them in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss gave the driver the name of the hotel Kyla was staying at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze a little. Then, she was relieved. After all, Mallory Malcom was the one who booked the hotel. It was only natural that he knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two arrived at Kyla's hotel room, Martin Weiss looked around the room while Kyla said, "What would you like to drink? There's plenty to drink in the fridge."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I'm only here to make some things clear to you and save you from coming to my office every day. I don't care about gossip, but it's bad for the company if rumors get out of hand," he said as he went straight to the French window and pulled the curtains back to look out the window.</p></div>
