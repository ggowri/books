        <h1>Chapter 1482</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How long has she been asleep?" Jason asked the caregiver nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"An hour or so," the caregiver replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason bent down, raised his hand, and gently touched Grace's cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was only at a time like this when he could touch her. Or else, she would throw up again when she was awake because of her body's resistance to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The caregiver's eyes could not help but flash with shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was assigned to take care of Mrs. Reed but had never seen Master Reed before this. She had always thought that Mrs. Reed probably only got to join the Reed family because she was pregnant and Master Reed did not care about Young Madam at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the situation now made the caregiver a little dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Master Reed looked like he cared a lot about Young Madam! He was so careful in touching her as if he was touching a rare treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, Grace's eyelashes fluttered a little. She opened her eyes in a daze. When she caught sight of Jason's face, she murmured, "Jay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He immediately stiffened but had already subconsciously withdrawn his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm sorry I woke you. Go back to sleep if you're still sleepy," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I won't be able to sleep tonight if I go back to sleep," she said as she slowly sat up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He subconsciously wanted to help her sit up but seemed to think of something, so he lowered his hands and asked the caregiver to help Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You should go wash up. I'll ask them to serve the food," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," replied Grace as she moved to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Due to her big belly, she moved very slowly now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she finished washing up and came to the dining room, she saw Jason sitting quietly on a chair beside the dining table. It seemed that he was looking at his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What's wrong... with his hands?' Grace wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As if sensing her gaze, he suddenly looked up. He came forward and helped her pull out her chair but never touched her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Today was their first Chinese New Year after she married into the Reed family. The maids and the caregiver did not have New Year's Eve dinner with them and were in another small hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, there were only Grace and Jason at this large dining table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a variety of food today, and the dishes were almost all her favorites. Grace ate the meal mouthful after mouthful. She would glance at Jason from time to time out of the corners of her eyes. Now that she had seen him again, some things...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why do you keep peeking at me? You can just look at me if you want. We're husband and wife, aren't we?" Jason said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace instantly felt embarrassed. She had been caught peeking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You know what? I'm happy," he continued saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was stunned. "Happy?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm happy you let me have this New Year's Eve dinner with you. I'm happy you... wanted to see me." His eyes stared at her. "And I'm happy you&rsquo;re calling me &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; again. Grace, have you thought of me these days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked at him blankly. Of course, she had thought of him. She thought about all that had happened between them as well as their future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I miss you so much. I've been thinking about you these days." Jason's mutters slowly drifted into the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly, and as if she had made up her mind, she said, "Yes, I've thought of you."</p></div>
