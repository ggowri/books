        <h1>Chapter 4301 I Don't Need Your Pity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina sat in the car blankly, her expression filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she rejected again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has Chandler rejected her twice?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't he love her very much? But when she said she loved him, he didn't believe her?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, I'm not sympathizing or pitying you!" Tina turned to him and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's not the case, then why did you go from not loving me to loving me in such a short time?" Chandler said calmly, "Tina, you're not good at lying, so when you said you didn't love me, it was true, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she really thought that way, but it wasn't actually true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why isn't it the truth when I say I love you now?" Tina asked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes, people have illusions. Illusions that make you think it's liking or love. Just like what you said before, even though you lost your memories, you still like the things you used to like. You used beverages, dishes, and cocktails to prove it. So naturally, you would think that you loved me before and would still love me now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler paused, his gaze meeting Tina's, "But people are not objects. People are different. Objects are fixed, like the taste of the food you've eaten before, it's still the same taste when you eat it again. But people change, and feelings change. </span><span>So</span><span> someone you loved before may not be loved in the future. You just mistakenly thought that you fell in love with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina wanted to retort, but Chandler's finger pressed against her lips, stopping her from continuing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, I appreciate you, and I never expected you to plan to save me in this way. But I really don't need it. Since I signed the divorce agreement, it means I've truly decided to let you go. </span><span>So</span><span> you don't need to pity me, you don't need to sympathize with me, and you definitely don't need to do these things for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt her lips burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since losing her memories, this was the first time she clearly understood her own feelings and expressed them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she realized that he no longer believed her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she argued now, he still wouldn't believe her, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should she do? If it were the old Tina, the Tina who hadn't lost her memories, what would she do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tina's mind was in chaos, Chandler's voice sounded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where were they? Tina suddenly snapped out of her thoughts and realized that the car had already arrived at the entrance of the Stephenson family mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler opened the car door and let Tina get out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't come in. You've been drinking today, so get some rest early tonight!" After saying that, he got back in the car, and it slowly drove away from the Stephenson family mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stared at the departing car, suddenly feeling a sense of powerlessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, inside the car, Chandler's gaze fell on the driver in the front seat. "No matter what you heard just now, you must not say a word about it. Otherwise, you won't have a place to stand in Emerald City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" The driver broke out in a cold sweat and quickly responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler turned his head and his gaze fell on the scenery outside the window, which was steadily receding. His hand slowly touched his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew very well that she was just being sympathetic, so why was his heart still pounding so intensely?!</span></p></div>
