        <h1>Chapter 2214</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must have stained them when she bandaged his wounds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her bloodstained skin suddenly burned a little. Kyla bit her lip slightly and quickly turned on the faucet to wash her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The blood on her hands immediately washed away, but the burning feeling seemed to remain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pale face and weak appearance kept flashing across her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Is he really just tired? I&rsquo;ve never seen him like that before. Even when I was dressing his wounds, I could feel the iciness of his hands.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some reason, she felt a certain uneasiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh. Stop thinking about it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head to get rid of everything about Martin Weiss in her mind. She and Martin Weiss were opposites. Though they briefly crossed paths, it would be nothing more than an encounter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Mrs. Corbyn found a glass missing. When she asked about it, Kyla said awkwardly, "I accidentally broke it when I got up to have a drink."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, you didn't hurt yourself, did you?" asked Mrs. Corbyn, worried about her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, there have been talks in the neighborhood about whether you and Martin Weiss are not on speaking terms. They said Martin Weiss's car is always parked nearby, and he would look at the store from the car. Did something... happen between you and him again?" said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla deliberately downplayed it by saying, "What else can it be? It's just about my pregnancy. I already told Martin Weiss to stop coming over, lest the neighbors gossip. We'll just tell them he's from L City and works there. I'm still staying here because I'm pregnant, so it's more convenient for you to take care of me like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, that's all we can tell them, I guess." Mrs. Corbyn sighed. "Martin Weiss still has deep feelings for you. Oh, if your father hadn't done that to the Weiss family... Wouldn't you have been happily married to him by now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, Martin Weiss would never have approached me if it hadn't been for Dad. I'm nothing but an ordinary woman to him," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some things happened for a reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you don't want to give him another chance? He's been single all these years, and now you're going to have another child with him. In the future&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla interrupted her mother. "Mom! It's impossible for Martin Weiss and me. I'm scared to bet on it, and I don't want to bet on it. If I lose, I&rsquo;ll be doomed. I&rsquo;ll never be able to get back up again! Mom, I just want to take good care of you and raise the children!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn sighed at that and ceased to persuade her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla got up to gather the goods.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Give him another chance...' It was not that she had not thought about another possibility for her and Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, everything ended before she could make up her mind. Perhaps it was fate. Just when Martin Weiss was about to make her fall for him again, the incident in the hospital made her understand that it was impossible between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she was able to quickly stop those feelings and put herself back on track.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was glad it was not too late to stop herself from falling into it again.</p></div>
