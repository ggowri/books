        <h1>Chapter 3924</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's heart suddenly tightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with you?" He asked, his hand that was originally holding her neck unconsciously loosened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have you seen my mother?" Nancy murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with you?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Nancy still asked in a roundabout way, "Have you seen my mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick suddenly understood that she might be a little confused at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was she sleepwalking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in his impression, her symptoms seemed to be somewhat different from sleepwalking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or, because her mother's death was too much of a shock to her, she was refusing to accept the fact that her mother had died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I haven't seen your mother," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even he himself felt a little unbelievable that he was answering the words of someone who was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hearing his answer, she looked disappointed and stood there blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears the size of beans kept rolling down her face, making her already tear-stained face even wetter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick had seen women cry before, many times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, many women liked to use tears as a weapon to try and make him feel sorry for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the face of those women's tears, he remained completely unmoved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, at this moment, looking at her tears, he felt like there was something blocking his chest, making him uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't cry," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Nancy seemed to not have heard his voice at all, and her tears continued to flow, with a faint sobbing sound coming from her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tears became more and more, and along with the gentle crying sound, Mick began to feel more and more restless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you not to cry!" With his words falling, he pulled her over and pressed his lips directly onto hers, blocking the crying sound that was making him feel uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't want to hear her crying voice anymore, nor did he want to see her tears, as it made him extremely uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed like the only thing left was the sound of their breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The warmth on her lips made Nancy vaguely come back to her senses, and then her pupils suddenly widened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was going on? Where was she now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the feeling on her lips... was it a kiss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is the man in front of her kissing her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mind is almost blank, as if a piece of it has been cut off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All the blood in her body seems to be concentrated on her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The warm touch, is this... Mick's lips?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this reality or just an illusion?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After what seems like an eternity, his lips finally leave hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those pitch-black eyes stare at her fixedly. "Finally stopped crying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She opens her eyes wide, tears still hanging on her eyelashes, but the crying has finally stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you kiss me?" She asks stiffly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick purses his thin lips. Kissing her was unexpected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was just annoyed and didn't want to hear her crying, so he made this move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because your crying was too annoying," he says impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Come to think of it, he always has a lot of "unexpected" things happen since he met her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stares at the man in front of her, weighing the truth of his words.</p></div>
