        <h1>Chapter 2522</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Louise Mitchell said, "I also blame myself for not finding this out sooner. If Sis had trusted me more and told me the truth earlier, maybe I could have saved her sooner. I hope Sis will trust me after this incident. We&rsquo;ll always be sisters!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The words were uttered with such affection that those who did not know them would think that she loved her sister very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory was in no mood to watch Louise Mitchell play pretend. He asked the bodyguards to fend off the reporters and hurriedly got into his car with Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as he got into the car, George Gregory said expressionlessly, "I gave you what you requested. We&rsquo;ll go to the hospital later and ask the hospital to give you a full-body check-up to prepare for Simon's transfusion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expression on Louise Mitchell's face changed. "Did you get me out only because of Simon? Do you really have no feelings for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said indifferently, "Do you think I'm supposed to feel anything for you today? What do you think I should feel for a woman who can harm her sister and use her own son as a bargaining chip?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really think I'm that evil?" said Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said nothing as if he was not bothered to pay her any attention. He only closed his eyes to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell suddenly laughed, but her laughter sounded harsh. "George Gregory, you're really heartless. You treated Amber Mitchell that way, and you&rsquo;re treating me the same. Someone like you can never truly love anyone. You love only yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's eyes opened suddenly. "You'd better not mention Amber Mitchell in front of me again, or I'll make sure you can never utter another word."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's pupils shrank suddenly. "Aren't you afraid I won't help Simon with his transfusion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since I&rsquo;ve gotten you out, it's not up to you to reject the transfusion. Even if you refuse to do so, I can still make you help Simon with his transfusion," George Gregory said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's heart sank. She knew how cold-blooded he was, but she had always hoped that he would develop feelings for her one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more she had admired his tender affections for Amber Mitchell, the more she found herself ridiculous now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe he had exhausted all his affections when he was with Amber Mitchell, so he did not have any to give to her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to the hospital, and Louise Mitchell followed George Gregory out of the vehicle. She was forced to go to the VIP ward that George Gregory had booked for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stay here for a few days first. The hospital will arrange for you to help with Simon's transfusion after the full-body checkup. After that, I won't stop you from going anywhere you want," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell pressed her red lips tightly as she listened quietly and did not raise any objections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the nurse handed over a series of documents regarding the full-body check-up and blood draw for the transfusion, which Louise Mitchell signed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A nurse soon led Louise Mitchell to do the check-up while George Gregory left the hospital.</p></div>
