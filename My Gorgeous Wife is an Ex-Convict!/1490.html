        <h1>Chapter 1489</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason walked out of the room. The hands hanging by his sides were slightly clenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she took hold of his arm, wrapped her arms around his neck, and was about to kiss him, did she know how nervous and expectant he was?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... it was just another disappointment in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though she was willing to convince him in that way, her body's reaction was not fooling anyone. Her body was still resisting him, so she had not really forgiven him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, at least she was willing to lie to him and comfort him in such a way. He should be content.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He and she... had the rest of their lives. Once the danger at hand was settled and once their children were born, he would have plenty of time to make her accept him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason gave some orders to the caregiver and bodyguards outside. Just then, Terrence hurried over. "Master Reed, I have something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes shimmered slightly, and he waved his hand to the caregiver nearby. The caregiver hurried into the room to look after Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Outside the room, Jason looked at Terrence. "What is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We found Secretary Wang," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was stunned. "Where is he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence said, "We found him at Old Master Reed's tomb. He went to pay his respects. He tried to escape after he was found, but our men stopped him. He's being held in a house not far from the cemetery. Do you want to see him, Master Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course, I want to see him. After all, he was the closest person to Old Master Reed," Jason said coldly. Secretary Wang had not been seen nor was there any news of him in these few days. Hence, something must be going on with his sudden appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, Jason wondered if Secretary Wang had anything to do with Lily's escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had a feeling that all these incidents were too coincidental.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Come on," said Jason as he walked toward the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence quickly followed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Moments later, a black Bentley slowly pulled away from Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car drove to a mansion near the cemetery. As soon as Jason got off, someone quickly stepped forward and said, "Master Reed, he's inside, but he won't say anything. He said he won't say anything until he sees you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lead the way," Jason ordered coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He immediately led the way for Jason and they soon came to one of the rooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang was sitting on a chair. His face was a little blueish and red after getting beaten up earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Jason walked in, a smile appeared on Secretary Wang's swollen face. "There you are. I'd like to ask what's the reason for capturing me all of a sudden, Young Master. I've done you no wrong!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No wrong?" Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "Didn't you email Brian the truth about the case on behalf of Old Master Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That was Old Master Reed's order," said Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Was helping Lily escape Old Master Reed's order too?" Jason seemed to ask nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang showed an innocent expression. "I don't understand what you mean, Young Master. Has Lily... escaped? I only know from the news that she was detained by the police."</p></div>
