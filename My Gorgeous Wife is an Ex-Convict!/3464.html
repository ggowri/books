        <h1>Chapter 3462</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he felt that his previous hesitation and struggle might have appeared like a clown's antics in the eyes of the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can talk to my father about business matters and do as your family wishes," Jasper continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel was shocked to hear this. After all, he and Mason weren't that close, and besides, Mason wasn't the type of person who was kind, innocent, and helpful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It can even be said that Mason is actually a very "cold" person, and he can't be bothered with anything that doesn't involve him or Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What... is your purpose?" Daniel asked, staring at the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, yes," Mason admitted generously, "My goal is to get you to break up with Veronica."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Break up?" Daniel's hand, which was hanging by his side, suddenly tightened into a fist. "You want me to break up with Veronica? Why?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I never thought you could stay by Veronica's side for a whole year, and that's long enough," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's body trembled slightly. "What do you mean by that? Haven't you already accepted my relationship with Veronica? You even hung out with us at school events and meals throughout this past year!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's not acceptance," said Mason expressionlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the word "surveillance" flashed through Daniel's mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that's not acceptance, then is it surveillance? Is he monitoring his relationship with Veronica?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This... Veronica feels like her closest "little brother"!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you...do you really like Veronica too?" he exclaimed. He had once thought that Mr. Mason of the Reed family had feelings for Veronica that went beyond siblinghood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, he started dating Veronica, and Mason didn't show any strong reaction, so he thought he was just overthinking things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at this moment, he couldn't help feeling that he had overthought things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I definitely like Veronica. To me, she is the most important person and the one I want to be with for the rest of my life," said Mason. His beautiful black eyes were now looking proudly at Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is someone who seems to have complete control over the situation, watching the chess pieces that are already trapped in the game, saying "Daniel, you can't do it, and neither can anyone else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's heart sank suddenly. "So, our family's situation was also part of your scheme, Mason? You are so despicable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason sneered and looked at the other person with mocking eyes, "Do you really enjoy blaming others for your mistakes just to feel innocent? I don't need to do something like this. All I have to do is wait for a suitable opportunity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel was in a state of distress, and then he heard Mason say, "If you break up with Veronica, then this deal can go as you wish. However, I don't want Veronica to know about our transaction, so you can use other reasons to break up with her. After the breakup, she won't know that you wanted to use her to get your family out of trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I never thought of using her! My feelings for her are not what you think," Daniel defended himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, if you really do meet Veronica today and make a request, but she doesn't agree, what will you do? Will you continue to interact with her as before, pretending nothing happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel was speechless upon hearing this. If it was true, could he still continue his relationship with Veronica?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once the father is actually imprisoned, the Cross family will suffer such a great calamity. Will he hold no resentment towards Veronica in his heart? Even if he doesn't, his parents will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So in the end, it's likely that he and Veronica will break up, right?</p></div>
