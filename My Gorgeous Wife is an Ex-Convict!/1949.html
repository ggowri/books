        <h1>Chapter 1947</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When it was the wee hours of the morning, the caretaker froze when she heard the door open. Then, she saw the door being pushed open and a tall figure walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Excuse me, Sir..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Go out first. I want to see her alone," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But..." The caretaker seemed hesitant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm Hadwin Stephenson. Does that put your mind at rest?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The caretaker froze. Hadwin Stephenson? The person who arranged the job told her to take good care of the pregnant woman and that the person who assigned the job was from Stephenson Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew that the head of Stephenson Group was called Hadwin Stephenson, but it was the first time she was seeing what Hadwin Stephenson looked like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The caretaker left the ward quickly without saying anything and closed the door quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked down at the sleeping Lina. The moonlight shone on her face through the glass window, allowing him to see her sleeping face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His heart, which had been restless the entire night, seemed to finally calm down after seeing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, how much do you love me? How much of what you said is true?" muttered Hadwin Stephenson, but no one gave him an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, he pulled her phone out of his pocket, placed it on her bedside table, and left the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina woke up the next day, she instantly froze when she saw her phone on the bedside table. Then, she quickly asked the caretaker, "Did someone come over last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough, she heard Hadwin Stephenson's name from the caretaker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I could have seen him if I hadn't slept so soundly yesterday!' Lina thought regretfully. Then, she turned on her phone and went to her photo album. She wondered if he had deleted anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the next moment, she was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The number of photos in her photo album had increased instead of decreased. All the deleted photos were restored. Not one was missing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Did he have it restored?' Lina was filled with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Hadwin restored the photos. Does that mean he still has feelings for me? Did he restore the photos because he doesn&rsquo;t want me to be sad?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney entered the ward in the morning, they saw their daughter holding her phone while giggling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Didn't you say yesterday that you left your phone with Hadwin Stephenson?" asked Mr. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin sent it over," Lina said happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He was here last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, but I was asleep. I'll see him when I discharge from the hospital," said Lina, suddenly having a lot of hope for the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't... land yourself in the hospital again when you see him," said Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "Got it. Mom and Dad, don't worry. Hadwin and I have made a deal. It'll be for a month. During this month, he won't reject me from seeing him. But if he still doesn't want to be with me a month later, I'll return to Emerald City with you."</p></div>
