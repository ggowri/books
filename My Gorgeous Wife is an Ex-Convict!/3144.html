        <h1>Chapter 3142</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Valda and Camille initially thought that Brian ending Tracy's career would be the end of the matter. But a few days later, they realized that it might have only been the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, the Barlow family encountered trouble as the Barlow Group was investigated for tax evasion. At the same time, an employee came forward with evidence that the company was selling subpar products under false pretenses. The employee made their report using their real name and provided a significant amount of evidence to support their claims.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the Barlow family was completely overwhelmed and became the target of criticism from many netizens online. Even Tracy's ban was applauded by many people!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some of Tracy's fans want to say a few words to support their idol, but when they speak up, they often face a lot of criticism and attacks from others. As a result, they become hesitant to say anything at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, in the Barlow family, the elderly Mr. Barlow was looking at his daughter with anger on his face. "Why did you offend Brian? Don't you know what kind of person he is? In Emerald City, if you offend him, you will suffer the consequences. Now, not only are you ruining yourself, but you also plan to ruin the entire Barlow family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy has already dropped the pretense of being overly friendly with Valda. She says with a hint of sadness, "I...I didn't offend Brian. I just didn't like his fianc&eacute;e."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's Brian's fianc&eacute;e. Do you have a problem with her?" said the old Mr. Barlow angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, that woman looks average and she even has a limp. Why did Brian choose someone like her? I...I just wanted to get close to Brian and at least not let that woman take his fianc&eacute;e's place!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, the old Mr. Barlow became even more furious and trembled with anger. "Don't you know how hard Brian worked to find his fianc&eacute;e in the past year? You embarrassed him like this! If Brian only cared about a woman's appearance, there are so many female stars in the entertainment industry he could choose from. His side would have been full of people by now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, Tracy, don't think too much about it! You shouldn't talk about your daughter like that. Now, we should think about how to get through this difficult situation," said Mrs. Shen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old Mr. Barlow thought for a moment. "Since the root of this matter is on Brian's fianc&eacute;e, we can only go find her now! Quickly apologize to her and see if we can make amends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Apologize?" Tracy looked incredulous. "Dad, do you want me to apologize to that cripple?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You caused this matter. Shouldn't you try to make things right? If the Barlow family falls, do you think you can still live like this? By then, everyone can step on our heads!" said the old Mr. Barlow unkindly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy could only bite her lip reluctantly upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Apologize?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The reason why Brian blacklisted her and dealt with the Barlow family must have been instigated by that woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And to think that they still wanted her to apologize, Tracy felt very nauseous at the thought!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But unfortunately, she has no choice but to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Tracy arrived at the neighborhood where Valda was located.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, it's not very difficult to find out this address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she didn't go in immediately. Instead, she waited for Valda to come out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her father said she should apologize, she was free to choose how to apologize in her own way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, she has a way to make Valda forgive her, and then Brian will naturally have to give up targeting the Barlow family.</p></div>
