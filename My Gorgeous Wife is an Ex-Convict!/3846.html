        <h1>Chapter 3844</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it only made himself more embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, if you really don't want me to hurt Jasper, then you protect her and don't give me the chance to hurt her!" Lawrence said before leaving on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The student who had helped William open the door earlier was now standing awkwardly in place, glancing at Lawrence's departing figure and then at Jasper and William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Um...did he just hear something he shouldn't have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper and William left the chemistry lab, and William looked at the silent Jasper and asked, "What kind of choice did Lawrence mention just now? What did you and he talk about in the lab?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he could see their actions in the lab through the glass door, he couldn't hear what they were saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed her dry lips and said, "I asked him if he instigated Daniel. He didn't admit it directly, but it was an indirect admission. However, as he said, there is no evidence to point to him. Unless he confesses, he won't take any responsibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be feeling very upset," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm," Jasper replied with a heavy nasal tone, already feeling a bit choked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After this incident, your family will be more careful about safety in the future. If he wants to make another move, it won't be so easy," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know," Jasper said. "After this incident, the Reed family has done everything they should do. Even if Lawrence is not arrested by the police, he is now an enemy of the Reed family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what was the choice he mentioned?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He said that if he wants to let go of his hatred, then I should marry him and leave Emerald City with him," Jasper said, not hiding anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was surprised, but then his eyes showed understanding. Indeed, Lawrence's thoughts towards Jasper...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't agree, did you?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, how could I agree when the person I love is not him!" Jasper said, wrapping her arms around William's waist and burying her head in his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After today, she understood that there was no possibility of going back to the way things were with Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enemies...she never thought that one day she would become an enemy with Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of playing the piano together in the past can only be seen in dreams in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William..." Jasper murmured, "Lawrence and I are no longer friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his low and hoarse voice, there was a strong sense of regret and sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what happens in the future, I will be by your side," William said, raising his hand to gently stroke Jasper's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand was large and warm, making her feel very secure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that since they met, no matter what bad things happened, he would unconditionally stand by her side, making her feel at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Jasper asked, looking up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When have I ever lied to you?" William asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper breathed a long sigh of relief. "Fortunately, you are by my side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should say, fortunately, you fell in love with me," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being able to receive her love was his greatest fortune. If she hadn't fallen in love with him, his life would have been colorless, and he might not have been better off than Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the future, will Lawrence still make a move against the Reed family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or will he choose to make a move against Jasper?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of this, William's heart sank and he held the person in his arms tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, he wouldn't let Lawrence have the chance to harm Jasper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one day Lawrence really dared to do such a thing, then he would take care of Lawrence first, no matter what it takes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he must become even stronger, strong enough to fear no one, strong enough to provide her with enough protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, William made a certain determination in his heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p></div>
