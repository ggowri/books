        <h1>Chapter 3851</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, Veronica bit her lip lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Beside Veronica, Shirley glanced at her friend and then at Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shirley had taken some time off and returned to school to attend classes, only to find out what her friend had been through during that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had almost been buried in a pile of rubble! And what shocked Shirley even more was that Mason had risked his life to rush in and save Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Veronica recounted the events, Shirley felt like she was watching a romantic movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was simply thrilling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when she learned that her friend and Mason had finally reconciled because of this incident, she breathed a long sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Things had finally turned out well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, you and Veronica are boyfriend and girlfriend now, right?" Shirley asked bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Mason answered just as bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You won't break up with Veronica so easily in the future, will you? Do you know how much it hurts her when you break up with her so casually? And do you know how hurtful some of the things people say about her at school are?" Shirley spoke up for her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But today, Mason had come to the school to pick up Veronica himself, so the rumors and gossip about her at school should have died down a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We won't break up again," Mason said with a confident tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shirley hadn't expected Mason to answer so confidently, so she asked unconsciously, "So does that mean you two will get married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes." Another affirmative answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shirley looked at her friend with envy. Was this the result of a successful love affair? "When you get married, you must invite me to the wedding!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, we will." Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica blushed and followed Mason into the car. She couldn't help but say, "You and Shirley were a bit too suggestive..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think we won't get married?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hesitated. Of course, she didn't think that way. After experiencing so much together, she was convinced that they would spend their future together. But... "The way you and Shirley talked just now, it seemed like we would get married soon, which is a bit exaggerated."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We will get married after we graduate, but it's only a year away." Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ahem!" Veronica almost choked on her own saliva. "Are you serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I'm lying?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But don't you think it's too early? When we graduate, we're still young, and you're two years younger than me... Men in the city rarely get married so early."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since we've decided to spend our lives together, what does it matter if it's early or late? We'll get married anyway." Mason said, looking straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you? Do you want to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Somehow, at that moment, Veronica felt her heart beating faster, as if this question was not just about whether she wanted to get married or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze seemed to be asking her if the promise she had made to him still held true. Did she regret it? Was there any reluctance?</p></div>
