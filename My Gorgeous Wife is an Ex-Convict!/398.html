        <h1>Chapter 397</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the Reed family's owner. It was not unusual for the children of the Reed family to inherit the Reed family&rsquo;s fortune and assets. Was he going to kill off the Reed family tree because of her? Grace thought that she was naive for forgetting to think about this before impulsively dating him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For how long though?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even in the cases she had dealt with before, in such a powerful and wealthy family, the existence of an heir was far more important than in ordinary families.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened? Your body..." he said, frowning at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lowered her head, resting her eyes on her flat belly. "Once... I was beaten so badly that I ruptured my... uterus. I eventually recovered, but the doctor also told me that my uterus was so badly hurt that I might not be able to conceive in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a little difficult for her to say these, and it was her deepest sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A flash of gloom passed over his eyes. She was beaten? When was she beaten? Was it when she was in prison? How much pain would that have caused her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, there was an indistinguishable quiver in his body. All her sufferings had now become an unbearable weight upon his heart, almost choking him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more she had been hurt, the more he regretted it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had a little pity for her back then, he would not have let the others hurt her at will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If... If you want to break up now, then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke in a low voice, but he interrupted her before she could finish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought I told you not to even think about breaking up." He put his hand around her waist and drew her into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" she exclaimed, unconsciously looking up. Her eyes could not help bumping into his dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The person I want is you, the person I love is also you. It has nothing to do with whether you can bear my children or not. Even if I'll never have children of my own, I still won't let you go." His forehead touched hers, and his cold voice confidently said, "Remember what I said. Now that you've fallen in love with me, you'll have to love me forever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was completely stunned. Her nose was filled with his scent while his voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he know what he was saying? It did not matter whether he would have children? Was he serious?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As though he had read her mind, he muttered, "I mean it. I never thought it was important to have children. I don't plan to have any children with another woman if she's not you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to be indifferent about the idea of having children. If the old man wanted an heir for the Reed family, he would have just chosen a woman the old man liked to be the mistress of the Reed family and give him an heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just did not want to get into trouble with the old man on such a trivial matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes. Marriage and children, which mattered a lot to the others, were trivial matters to him.</p></div>
