        <h1>Chapter 874</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she made an effort to withdraw her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he held it firmly and said, "Call me &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is inappropriate, Mr. Reed. We&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Call me Jason." He insisted. "Or do you want to hang out with me here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip and glanced around from the corners of her eyes. Many people were looking sideways at them right now. If they stayed here, there was going to be a video of both of them put up online soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" she blurted out the word with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he was smiling faintly. Joy replaced the danger and fury in those beautiful peach blossom eyes...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched Jason walk into her rental house and wondered if she should move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, on second thought, even if she did move, he would still be able to enter her house at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want?" said Grace as she glared at Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to cook dinner?" he asked, looking at some of the vegetables she had bought from the market earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make it for two. I'll have some too," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused before saying," I only bought enough vegetables for one. I don&rsquo;t have enough to make dinner for two. If you're hungry, you can eat in a restaurant or order takeout."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to eat your cooking. If there aren&rsquo;t enough ingredients, tell me what else you need and I'll just get someone to buy them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. Knowing him, if he really decided to do something, then he would make it happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The difference was just the process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's just a meal. I&rsquo;ll just treat it as I&rsquo;m thanking him for saving my life today,' she thought to herself. Then, with a long sigh, she turned to him and said," Alright, got it. I'll make dinner. It'll probably take half an hour."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she turned and went into the kitchen to cook dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace expertly washed and chopped the vegetables before cooking them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Jason was looking at her slender figure quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if by looking at her like this, he could feel satisfied again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days when he was alone in the empty Reed Residence, his mind was full of her. Every night, he had to sleep in the bedroom that she used to sleep in with the blanket she used and the clothes she did not take with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This way, it would feel as if he was holding her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Like someone dying of thirst in the desert, even sniffing her residual scent on these objects made him feel as if he could still breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until now that he saw her and she was really in sight that he felt alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like finally seeing the oasis in the desert and then desperately trying to get close to the water&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace finished cooking, took the food out of the kitchen, and put it on the small dining table. Then, she handed the chopsticks to Jason.</p></div>
