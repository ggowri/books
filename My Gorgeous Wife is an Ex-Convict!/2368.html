        <h1>Chapter 2366</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I've checked, and there are four rooms here. Three are bedrooms, so I chose the second bedroom," she said when he walked out of the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why the second bedroom? Are you leaving the master bedroom to me? We'll be sleeping in separate rooms?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instantly felt as though he had seen through her. After all, it was indeed her plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "I thought I made it clear earlier that I want us to get along like a regular married couple during this time? I'm not looking for a roommate. If you intend to keep our agreement, you&rsquo;ll sleep in the master bedroom and leave the bathroom door unlocked if you need to wash up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Huh?' Kyla froze. "Why... can't I lock the bathroom door?" She blushed a little as she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If anything happens to you in the bathroom, at least I can enter without having to kick the door down. It&rsquo;ll save a lot of time," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly understood and replied dully, &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I have other intentions toward you?" he asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. Of course&hellip; I know that. With the way I look right now, there's no way you&rsquo;ll have other intentions toward me," she said as she lowered her head and went to the second bedroom to put some of her belongings in the master bedroom. Then she grabbed her toiletries and a change of clothes before hurrying into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bathroom door was closed but not locked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stood at the bathroom door as he listened to the sound of the rushing water. His hands that were by his sides were clenched slightly. A moment later, he leaned back against the wall near the bathroom door and took a long breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The funny thing was that she could still attract him and make him have mood swings despite him already trying to keep himself in check.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Have I lost my feelings for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But why do I think the hypnosis is gradually losing its effect? Why do I care more and more about her? Even when I came in and saw her resting on the couch, I felt content.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... am I content with?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss shook his head and told himself that he would officially divorce her in a year and two months. He would have grown tired of this boring husband and wife relationship by then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would realize that there was nothing more to married life with this woman when the time came!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, there's nothing more to it! There's nothing more!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He told himself over and over in his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla and Martin Weiss lay in the same bed all night. She thought she would have trouble falling asleep, but she only &lsquo;had trouble sleeping&rsquo; for ten minutes. When his scent enveloped her whole body and all she could smell was his scent, she suddenly felt safe and... fell soundly asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time she woke up the next day, Martin Weiss was no longer at home. However, there was a strange woman in the living room. As soon as she saw Kyla, she said, "Hello, Mrs. Weiss. I'm the caretaker Mr. Weiss hired to look after you. My name is Skye Maldonado. You&rsquo;re free to address me however you wish. Let me know if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her. She was a middle-aged woman in her 40s. She looked amiable, making people like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll call you Skye Maldonado, then. You may call me Kyla. I'm not used to being called Mrs. Weiss," said Kyla.</p></div>
