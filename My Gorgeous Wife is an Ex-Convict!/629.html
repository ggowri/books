        <h1>Chapter 628</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It has nothing to do with you. It's a good thing that you're helping me to reverse the case. I'm crying just because this thing has been weighing on my mind for so long that now that I know I can reverse it, my emotions went out of control," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips pressed together and said nothing. He only raised his hand and held her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His Grace did not know what he was saying sorry for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm sorry&hellip;' It was his indifferent connivance that had caused her to suffer such a terrible experience and left her wounded. All he could do was to clear her name for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she would probably never know the truth she really wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason held Grace very, very tightly...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Grace took a leave of absence with Kyla and went to the law firm with Jason. As it was about her case, she felt particularly nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To her surprise, Jason chose the law firm where she had worked at before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason in surprise. 'This... Can't be a coincidence.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you used to work here. After your accident, some of your colleagues laughed at you. That's why I chose this place. I'll help you gain back all the respect you've lost, and I'll make those who despised and belittled you before never dare to despise and laugh at you again. I want them to know that you were the victim and not the perpetrator of the case," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to hold her head higher than anyone else in front of her former colleagues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes could not help getting a little wet again. After going through so many things, she had gradually let go of some things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she knew that he was doing it for her. He did not want her to be looked down upon by anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Jason up the elevator to the floor where the law firm was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got out of the elevator, she found that her hands were already covered with cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was still nervous! She knew that it was in the bag since he had evidence to file an appeal, but she... Maybe it was too important for her to get the case reversed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go to the bathroom to wash my hands. Give me a minute," Grace said to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went into the bathroom. The water ran down her hands, making her tension subside a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fingers were not quite the same as before. Some of her knuckles looked a little strange because they had been broken before and she nearly lost them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they looked like they had recovered now, it was difficult, if not impossible, to do certain movements. Her joints often hurt in cold, wet weather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, because she had been taking traditional medicine to recuperate these days, her joints were feeling much better and there was almost no dull pain.</p></div>
