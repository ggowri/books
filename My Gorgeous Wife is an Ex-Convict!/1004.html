        <h1>Chapter 1003</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, some things were meant to be and there was no escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's&hellip; this?" asked Mrs. Corbyn. However, she could sort of guess what it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gave a wry smile. "Martin Weiss's going to fight for Nelson's custody with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You need to talk to Grace. Didn't she say she would help you?" Mrs. Corbyn said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn nodded and looked down at the letter in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Grace was willing to help her with the case, she knew that given her record as an ex-convict and her current living conditions, it would be difficult for them to win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not want to tell her mother these, lest her old mother worried even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, Mom, I'll talk to Grace. You should go to bed early. Don't worry too much," Kyla Corbyn said with fake nonchalance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Mrs. Corbyn was still worried. "If it doesn't work out, we can beg Martin Weiss. If he really wants to have children, he can get another woman to give birth to one for him. He doesn't have to fight for Nelson with us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's no use." Kyla Corbyn shook her head. She was not as naive as her mother. She knew how cruel Martin Weiss was, so she would never have such hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she knelt in front of Martin Weiss and begged, that man would just turn his nose up at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, I'll protect Nelson. I can do it." Kyla Corbyn gazed at her sleeping son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson&hellip; was her life. She would do anything to keep custody of her child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's secretary said respectfully to Paisley Daniels, "Miss Daniels, President Weiss is having a meeting in the meeting room right now." After all, everyone in the company knew that it would not be long before Miss Daniels became Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll wait for him in his office, then." Paisley Daniels smiled and walked into the president's office. Of course, the secretary dared not stop her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After entering the office, Paisley Daniels put her carefully made pastries on Martin Weiss's desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she and Martin were not married, she could never rest at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially now that Kyla Corbyn had given birth to a child, it made Paisley Daniels even more anxious. Even though he said he would fight for the child's custody and let her raise him, the mere thought of raising Kyla Corbyn's son made her uneasy. However, she had to pretend that she would be a good mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could Kyla Corbyn give birth to Martin's baby after being imprisoned while I... can't even conceive?!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was then that Paisley Daniels's eyes fell upon a document lying on the desk. Inside the document was a photograph with a corner of it exposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she pulled the photo out, she found that it was of a newborn child with the words &lsquo;Nelson Corbyn&rsquo; and the date of birth written on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is the baby here Kyla Corbyn's b*stard child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Then this information&hellip;' Paisley Daniels quickly picked up the document, looked through it, and found that it was clearly about Kyla Corbyn's time in prison as well as some of her whereabouts after her release.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin is investigating Kyla Corbyn?'</p></div>
