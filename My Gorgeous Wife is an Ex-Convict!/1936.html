        <h1>Chapter 1934</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina rushed up to Hadwin Stephenson and said with a sore nose, "I know you only agreed to Katherine Jackson's conditions and chose to break up with me to save me. Five years later, you protected me from Katherine Jackson again, and you even had a blood curse on you. Because of the blood curse, you were in excruciating pain every time you touched me. You even let Katherine Jackson enter your mansion to get rid of the blood curse..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson was listening indifferently. His expression did not change at all. It was as if her sobs and remorse were meaningless to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is that so? So you know." In the end, all she got was such an indifferent response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina bit her lip. "I went to the mansion to tell you that we could start over that day. But when I saw Katherine Jackson leave your mansion, I thought you and her... I didn't know it was because of the blood curse. I misunderstood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson murmured, "Yes, you misunderstood. But if you misunderstand things so easily, that means you don't have much trust in me, doesn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The sarcasm in Hadwin Stephenson's face intensified. "So how can you say you love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a pause, Hadwin Stephenson said, "What now? You found out you misunderstood me, so you came to look for me again? But Lina, you should&rsquo;ve known that I wouldn&rsquo;t be waiting for you and still foolishly remain in love with you just because you&rsquo;re now willing to come back to me. My love for you died when you tried to have an abortion in the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's tears immediately came pouring out. "I... I didn't abort the baby. Hadwin, I didn't... The baby is still in my belly. The baby is still here... I... I eat well and sleep well so that the baby can grow well..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she spoke, she took his hand and pressed it against her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was now four months pregnant, but her baby bump was unnoticeable. Even so, one could feel the slight bump by pressing one&rsquo;s hand against it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's hand pressed on Lina's belly. Time ticked by, and her tears ran down her cheeks, dripping onto his wrist. He instantly jerked his hand back as if her tears had burned it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's enough, Lina. So what even if you didn't abort the child?" He suddenly got up. "I&rsquo;ve never cared about the baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was all he cared about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was utterly disappointed because she wanted to abort the baby just to have nothing to do with him. He realized she could even sacrifice a life just to cut off ties with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He realized he had taken her words back then to heart, but it was only a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At that time, she had said to him, "Hadwin, if we do get pregnant, I want to give birth to the child because they're ours. They're my treasure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it turned out this treasure could be abandoned at any time! It was not even what she wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know you didn't abort the baby, but so what? What do you expect by suddenly coming here and telling me you love me? Do you want me to be with you and give the baby a complete family? Do you think I, Hadwin Stephenson, is just something a child needs?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina quickly said, "No, I... I want to be with you, but not for the baby! It's because I love you, so I don't want to lose you. I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, you&rsquo;ve already lost me!" Hadwin Stephenson coldly withdrew his hand.</p></div>
