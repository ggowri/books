        <h1>Chapter 3393</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley listened with a confused expression and asked, "So, in the future, will you treat me as well as Chandler treats Tina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell was taken aback and thought of Chandler's behavior towards Tina. Suddenly, he felt a sense of unease and realized that his engagement to this little guy might not be a good thing after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the future, when I get into a fight, will you help me fight?" The little one's clear black and white eyes looked at Lornell with a sharp and focused gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remembers how skilled he was during the fight on her birthday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell's mouth twitched. Is fighting the only thing this guy can think of?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't." He refused directly, he didn't want to help this little kid fight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her expression immediately turned into a deep disappointment. "Why are you different from Chandler? If it were Chandler, he would definitely help Sister Tina fight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I be like him?" Lornell said irritably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But aren't you all fianc&eacute;s?" Harley asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In one sentence, Lornell was so choked that he didn't know how to refute it for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From now on, if you help me fight, I will give you delicious food and let you play with my toys. I have a lot of fun toys!" She began to propose a conditional exchange, thinking she was clever, and luring him, "I have many toys that my dad says are limited edition and not sold outside!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Lornell doesn't find these things appealing at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could a 3-year-old girl possibly like this toy? She already has so many toys of her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, her expression amused him and he thought it might be fun to play with her. It seemed like it wouldn't be too boring to spend time with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If anyone bullies you in the future, I'll help you fight back," he reluctantly promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She immediately laughed and said, "Then you can't go back on your word, let's pinky promise!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"... " He once again had the urge to roll his eyes, forget it! He didn't want to do such a childish action!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was lying in the hospital bed, she reached out her small hand and looked at him with hopeful eyes. He couldn't help but reach out his hand and hooked his finger with hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pull the hook and hang on, unchanging for a hundred years," her childish voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immature! He thought to himself, but he didn't actually say it out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he himself doesn't really understand why he has to go along with her actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this feeling, will he only be able to understand it when he grows up?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During Harley's hospitalization, many people came to visit him from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After learning about Harley and Lornell's engagement, everyone had a strange expression on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people who don't know that Lornell is the heir of the Crypt families don't really feel anything, but they think it's a bit too early for the Hart family to arrange a betrothal for their child when they are so young.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who knew Lornell's true identity were surprised in their own way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jasmine came to see Harley, she cried a lot. Despite being only 3 years old and still wearing bandages on her head, Harley ended up comforting Jasmine who was a few years older than her.</p></div>
