        <h1>Chapter 2877</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since her best friend did not want to be too explicit, she would not probe further either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright then. Take good care of yourself," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she called her two assistants and told them the work arrangements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After these two calls, Valda Theller said to the two bodyguards, "Some of my work stuff is still at my house and studio. I want to pick them up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two bodyguards glanced at each other and said, "Miss Theller, you can make a list of what you need and we&rsquo;ll pick up the things for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at the bodyguards, immediately feeling speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian drove to Patrick's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick raised his eyebrows when he saw him. "Why are you here all of a sudden? Do you want me to call Valda Theller out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian snapped, "She's in my mansion right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was stunned. "She's in your mansion? Then what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I doing here? I don't even know what I'm going to do!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "There&rsquo;s a possibility that she could be pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Pregnant?" Patrick froze before understanding what was going on. "The night I called her over when you were drunk, did you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rest was self-explanatory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And now that she's at your mansion, does that mean you're taking responsibility?" Patrick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said I would marry her if she's pregnant and she could give birth to the baby, but she refused and decided to take birth control."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick froze. Many women wanted to marry into the Hart family, but Valda Theller refused!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What surprised him more was that his best friend even thought of getting married. "If she's indeed pregnant, do you plan to marry her for the sake of the baby? It's not worth it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pressed his thin lips together before saying, "There's nothing bad about marrying her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had thought about marrying her before. Even if he could not fall for Valda Theller, it would be nice to grow old with her if he had to choose a woman to be with for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't think it was true when you said you loved her, but now it seems to be true," Patrick said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian froze. 'I love Valda Theller?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, I haven&rsquo;t fallen for Valda Theller. I just like her. Grace will always be the one I love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not have dated Valda Theller if it were not for Grace's peace of mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at his silent best friend, Patrick patted him on the shoulder. "Brian, if you love Valda Theller enough to marry her, why don't you pursue her again? Women are soft-hearted. Besides, didn't you say she didn't break up with you because she didn't love you but because she loves you? Move on from your feelings for Grace and there&rsquo;ll be no conflict between you and Valda Theller."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked down, his long eyelashes hiding the agony in the bottom of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Move on? How should I move on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Should I forget her or stop loving her? Which one can I do?'</p></div>
