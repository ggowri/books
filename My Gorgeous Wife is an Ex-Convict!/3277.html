        <h1>Chapter 3275</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I searched for Grace for many years, but couldn't find her. So I found a replacement. As long as the woman resembled the image of the little girl I remembered Grace might have grown up to be, I would date her," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blinked and asked if you are dating your stand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How many women have you been in a relationship with?" she asked in a trembling voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't remember." He said, "During that time, I changed girlfriends frequently. Sometimes, if it was fast enough, I could change girlfriends in just one or two months."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he gave a bitter smile. "Wasn't I ridiculous back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His bitter smile made her heart ache. She took his hand and gently kissed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body trembled, and she heard her say, "That's because you really wanted to find Grace at that time." He must have been desperate, otherwise, why would a man like him look for a substitute to have more fantasies?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, you..." Brian started to say something, but didn't finish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda seemed to have guessed his thoughts and said, "You want to ask if I blame you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He answered softly, and it seemed that she was getting to know him better. There were things he didn't say, but she could guess them all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't blame you." She said, "That was something that happened in the past. There's nothing to blame. I didn't participate in your past life, but in the future, I won't miss it. I'll always be by your side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her gentle voice made a big stone in his heart gradually fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian suddenly hugged Valda. "Valda, if possible, I really hope to erase all those ridiculous things so that I can meet you with a better version of myself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But for me, you're already great, Brian," Valda said. "I also have a past, and no one can guarantee that their past is always good. As long as we can have a good future, that's all that matters, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He held her tighter for a moment. If it weren't for her being pregnant, he might have taken her to the bedroom right then and there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, from now on, I want us to be good every day," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh-huh." Valda raised her hands and hugged the other person back. "But why did you bring up your ex-girlfriends when we were talking about the child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She feels a bit strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian then talked about what happened during Lina's childbirth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda also knew about the danger during Lina's childbirth. "So, do they think that your ex-girlfriends might harm me during that time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although the possibility is very slim, after all these years, I haven't seen those people appear in front of me. But still, I need to make some preparations," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ready?" she wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, I won't let anything unexpected happen to you and the child," he said, lowering his head and placing a kiss on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sweetly smiled and said, "I am very relieved, Brian. I am not afraid of anything because I know you will make sure I am safe and sound!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the next few days, Brian began investigating the current information of his ex-girlfriends. Despite the passage of time, he was able to uncover all the information he needed if he really wanted to.</p></div>
