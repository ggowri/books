        <h1>Chapter 442</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it and found it reasonable, thus she nodded and said, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Subsequently, she devoured her breakfast while Jason continued to observe her with a smile on his face. He found her expression when she took each bite of her shaobing and youtiao, as well as each spoon of her douhua, extremely cute in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her ponytail, her neat and clean forehead, her elegant facial features, that pair of shimmering eyes, that little button nose, and those pinkish lips...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything was perfect to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never imagined that one day, he would fall in love with such a woman, yet it seemed so natural for him that he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace ate, she randomly looked up to have her almond eyes meet Jason&rsquo;s deep gaze. In that split second, she felt that her brain was vacuumed by that pair of eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Wh... What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Nothing. I just find you too pretty.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was dumbfounded. He had seen plenty of beautiful women, yet he could still say such a thing to her. Furthermore, she had neglected her skincare for the past few years. She knew that her looks right now were at most, average-looking. There was still a distance from being pretty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his gaze and expression were filled with sincerity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps this was what it meant by beauty was in the eye of the beholder? Grace urged him. &ldquo;You should eat before the food turns cold. It won&rsquo;t taste nice if it does.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled at her and said, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Then, he lowered his head and ate the shaobing, youtiao, and douhua.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched as Jason ate his breakfast. It was a simple meal. The shaobing and youtiao were still in their paper bag as he bit into them. His hands, as he ate his food, looked elegantly refined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she was watching an advertisement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was Jason, a man who could do as he pleased in Emerald City. Who would have guessed that he would be at a morning roadside stall having breakfast?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Furthermore... For her to be dating him was a peculiar situation itself, yet it was happening in reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they could have children of their own one day, that would be a beautiful thing to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her feelings for him seemed to be gradually increasing unknowingly... Was she starting to fall in love with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That thought paced around her mind right now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After breakfast, Jason drove Grace to her previous rented unit. When Grace opened the door, it stirred up some accumulated dust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she thought about it, it had been two to three months since she last came back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace began to tidy up the things in the house. The more important items had been brought along to the Reed Residence when she moved in last time. What was left were some off-season clothing, shoes, bedding, and some of her kitchenware.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have many possessions, thus she packed up in no time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What are you planning to do with these things?&rdquo; Jason asked.</p></div>
