        <h1>Chapter 3963</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, there is one more thing: Clarissa has been charged with murder and will soon be on trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is also big news in Emerald City. It is said that the Schultz family has been trying to use their connections to save their daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But anyone who knows a little bit about the inside story understands that Mick is the one who will prosecute Clarissa. So who would dare to help the Schultz family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helping the Schultz family is equivalent to offending the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this time Clarissa's guilt is conclusive, and there is no possibility of overturning the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nancy was at work, Francis came directly to the hotel to find her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he saw Nancy, Francis put on a remorseful expression. "Nancy, I know that the Schultz family mistreated you and your mother. Clarissa has been your sister for so many years. Can't you consider the sisterhood and not let her spend her best years in prison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't she also disregard sisterhood and plan to kill me?" Nancy said bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was just Clarissa's momentary impulse. She is not a bad person..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Francis could finish his sentence, Nancy interrupted him. "Not a bad person? So after pushing my mother off the balcony and killing her, she can feel no guilt? Not a bad </span><span>person? She was determined to kill me. As for the so-called sisterhood, she would slap me and insult me at the slightest provocation during these years with the Schultz family. I never felt like she treated me as a sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis's face immediately became ugly. "So, you're not planning to drop the charges?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a criminal case. It is impossible to drop the charges," Nancy said. "Moreover, when you do something wrong, accepting legal sanctions is only natural, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, you ungrateful wretch! The Schultz family raised you with so much effort, and this is how you repay us?" Francis angrily raised his hand and slapped Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A red mark immediately appeared on her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The father and daughter from the Schultz family really are alike! Nancy coldly looked at Francis. "If what you said to me today is all you have to say, then you can leave now. The next time we meet, it will be in court."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you - do you believe I'll kill you?" Francis threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to look down on his stepdaughter, but now she dared to talk to him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you believe that if you touch me again, the Schultz family won't exist in Emerald City anymore?" Nancy bluntly countered with a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis's face changed. He thought of Mick backing Nancy up and gritted his teeth before leaving in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy touched her still burning cheek and estimated that it was swollen. She would need to apply ice later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as she turned around, she unexpectedly saw Irene walking out from the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I happened to hear your conversation when I walked over here, so... um, sorry for coming out." Irene immediately apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay," Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was a public area and not just her own space.</span></p></div>
