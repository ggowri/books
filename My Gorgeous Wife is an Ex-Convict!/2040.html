        <h1>Chapter 2038</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Juliet Harper said politely, "Hello, aunt Cummins. Hello, aunt Corbyn." She looked so adorable with her cutesy voice and face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the little one's voice sounded a little nasally, so Grace said, "Does Juliet have a cold?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, she has a small cold, so I brought her to the hospital for a check-up. What about you?" said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson lost his hearing aid. We came to the hospital today to collect his new one," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla saw that Juliet's hair was a little messy, so she crouched down and said to the little one, "Why don't I fix your hair? Otherwise, it's going to be all over the place."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Juliet blinked and nodded. She was not afraid of strangers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Kyla took a small comb from her bag and combed Juliet's hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at Chase Harper and said, "Congratulations on getting married. Your child is so big now. It's a pity that I didn't get to attend your wedding dinner back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper was one of the few people who did not look at her differently when she was at her worst, and he had even helped her before. Grace had always been grateful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, as soon as she said that, he unexpectedly chuckled bitterly. "My wife and I are divorced." It was obvious that he did not want the child to hear that, so he kept his voice low.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry," said Grace, also slightly embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper smiled faintly. "It's nothing. Since we're not right for each other, it's better to separate than stay together. It's better for our child like this than letting her live in a family where there are disputes and quarrels all day long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Kyla was done braiding Juliet Harper's hair. Juliet Harper skipped over to him and asked, "Daddy, do I look good?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Guilt could not help flashing across Chase Harper's eyes as he looked at his daughter's neatly combed braids. These braids were indeed much better than what he could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After the divorce, he had tried his best to be both a father and mother figure for her, but there were some things a grown man with a daughter could not do very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," said Chase Harper. Then, he turned and said to Kyla, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't mention it," Kyla said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Nelson Corbyn walked out of the nearby consultation room. After seeing Chase Harper, he shouted with some surprise, "Uncle Harto!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson had not forgotten Uncle Harto, who took him to the amusement park and gave him many toys when he was little. It was just that they had not stayed in touch much after they moved and eventually grew out of touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper looked at Nelson and could not help saying emotionally, "You've grown so much!" Then, he turned and said to his daughter, "This is Brother Nelson I told you about. Come on, say hi."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Brother Nelson, my name is Juliet Harper," Juliet said cutely. She opened her arms to Nelson Corbyn, clearly gesturing for a hug.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn did not refuse and picked up Juliet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A nine-year-old was carrying a three-year-old. Although Nelson Corbyn was considered tall for a child his age, it was a little hard for him to hold a little girl who was 100cm tall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Nelson held her seriously and said to Juliet, "Juliet, hello."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Brother Nelson, you&rsquo;re so handsome. More handsome than Daddy made you out to be!" the little one said as her two small hands touched Nelson Corbyn's face curiously.</p></div>
