        <h1>Chapter 3001</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they left the school, Valda looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Are you still thinking about Mr. Yeats?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," Valda replied. "When that woman left, she threatened Mr. Yeats and said she would make it so he couldn't even be a teacher anymore. Mr. Yeats is at an age where he should be retiring in a few years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This kind of thing is naturally a blow to a teacher who is about to retire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I want to help Mr. Yeats," Valda said. Mr. Yeats had helped her when she needed it, and now she wanted to repay him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Brian agreed. "I'll have someone look into it and find out what's going on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," Valda smiled, and some of the worry on her face finally disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You finally smiled," he seemed to breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But he had already wrapped his arms around her waist, and looked down at her, saying, "Valda, if you encounter any problems in the future, don't worry. Just remember that I will help you solve everything. I want to see you smile more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hoped she could smile more and not worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, then I'll smile more from now on," she said, and a smile appeared on her face again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And he, looking at her smile, felt that everything was so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Brian quickly investigated the incident involving Mr. Yeats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because of an art competition, Mr. Yeats was one of the judges. A parent hoped that Mr. Yeats could give their child a high score and help them win an award, but Mr. Yeats refused. In the end, the child missed the award by only three points.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So the parent vented all their anger on Mr. Yeats and went directly to the education bureau, claiming that Mr. Yeats had taught improperly and caused psychological harm to their child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no factual basis for this matter originally, and it could have been resolved without any consequences. However, the Education Bureau got involved because the parent involved had connections and came from a notable background, which put pressure on the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The school naturally made arrangements to transfer Mr. Yeats away from the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian told Valda about the contents of the investigation report, she was filled with righteous indignation. "How could there be such parents? Mr. Yeats is such a good teacher, and just because of that parent's words, he has to leave the school where he has worked for decades?! It's simply ridiculous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous," said Brian. "In this world, there are always some people who do wrong but act like it's perfectly normal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, you mentioned earlier that the parent's family background is unusual. What do you mean by unusual? Are they from a powerful and influential family?" Valda asked.</p></div>
