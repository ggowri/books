        <h1>Chapter 1619</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "It's just common social etiquette. Besides, he's Lina's friend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know, but you couldn't take your eyes off him just now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I was just curious. After all, he doesn't look like Lina's colleague. Besides, you're the one I love. I'm not interested in other men at all!" Grace explained quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He looked at her with a smile as if he had gotten her to say this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace blushed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason leaned over slightly. Moving a little closer, he said, "Grace, say it again." His husky voice was full of temptation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's face became even redder. Even after so many years, she would still blush and her heart would still pound whenever she saw him behaving this way&mdash;just as she did at the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're the one I love," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Say it again." His voice grew hoarser, strumming her heartstrings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're the one I love. You're the one I love..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She repeated it over and over again as he wished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the other side, Yulai Stephenson, who was choosing cakes with Lina, stared at his right hand. He felt like he was still in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is that man... Jason?" Wanting confirmation, he could not help asking Lina in a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yep," Lina nodded and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is he... Jason from Reed group?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yep." It was still the same answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It's really him.' Anthony Sherman gasped. He never expected to meet Emerald City's tyrant, who was also the husband of Lina's friend, in a viral cake shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Come to think of it, there was Hadwin Stephenson, the president of Stephenson Group, and now Jason. Anthony Sherman wondered if he would meet any more big shots when he was with Lina next time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter?" Lina asked because Anthony Sherman had been silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing, I just didn't expect your friend's husband to be Jason," said Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said, "I didn't expect it either, but it's great they&rsquo;re together. If you feel uncomfortable, I'll talk to Grace later and we can leave first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There's no need for that. Even though he's Jason, I'll just think of him as your friend's husband." Anthony Sherman smiled. "That way, I won&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina secretly breathed a sigh of relief. She felt at ease with Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since the blind date, she and Anthony Sherman had asked each other out several times but the two of them seemed more like friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She felt no pressure when she was with Anthony Sherman. They got along, but there was just no chemistry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she told her parents about it at home, her mother had advised her earnestly, "Chemistry? Finding the right partner for marriage is all that matters. You can slowly develop feelings. How many people fall in love at first sight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is he the right one?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Anthony Sherman and I are friends, but can we make suitable marriage partners? Can I&hellip; really develop feelings for him in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And what about Anthony Sherman? Will he love me too? Or is he just looking for the &lsquo;right&rsquo; marriage partner?'</p></div>
