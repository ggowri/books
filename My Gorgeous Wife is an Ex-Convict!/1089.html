        <h1>Chapter 1088</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ended up waiting for Jason in his bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she did not want to wait, there was no place she could go. After all, she could only move within the confines of the mansion. She could not escape even if she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, she might as well not bother about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's bedroom was about the same size as hers, and the furniture was all vintage Chinese style. The difference was that his room had a wall covered with heavy curtains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could this wall... have residual blood on the wall like Splashes of Blood?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found it a little creepy as she thought of this. She went to the wall, looked at the curtains, and wondered what was on the wall behind it. Perhaps... the curtains were only for decoration?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the bathroom door opened and Jason came out of the bathroom after taking a shower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had only wrapped a towel around his waist, showing his lean yet firm upper body. His black eyes were staring straight at her. She immediately felt like a small animal caught in a trap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He walked step by step toward her, and she unconsciously stepped back. Suddenly, her foot caught on something and she fell back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" A cry of surprise escaped her mouth. Her hand almost instinctively grabbed one side of the curtains, pulling them...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The curtains were immediately drawn back, and at the same moment, an arm wrapped itself around her falling body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes immediately met Jason's handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank... you." After a moment, she steadied herself awkwardly. She turned away, trying to avoid his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she suddenly froze. Her almond-shaped eyes were gaping in disbelief at the wall where she had just accidentally pulled back the curtains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were many photos on the wall, and the person in all the photos was... her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My photos. Why..." she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are they on this wall?" he interjected, staring at her intensely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt her throat become unusually dry under his gaze while his fingers were caressing her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to avoid his touch, but her body had become as stiff as a board as if petrified by his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips parted as he spoke, "Because I can't sleep. I won't be able to sleep for even a moment If I don't look at these photos."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him in surprise, and it was as if a storm was surging in her heart. 'Does he mean... he's losing sleep? He can't sleep without looking at my photos?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He murmured, "Do you know how hard it is to fall asleep? I want to sleep, but I can't. Even when I close my eyes, I'm distracted by other thoughts in my head..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had managed to fall asleep by cradling her clothes in his arms, but later, it seemed to stop working. Only by looking at her photos could he fall asleep for a short while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Grace realized that the faint dark circles under Jason's eyes were probably caused by insomnia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now that you're here with me..." As he spoke, he leaned his head against her shoulder and took in her scent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His empty heart seemed to be satisfied.</p></div>
