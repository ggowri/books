        <h1>Chapter 947</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had made the decision not to tell him, so she did not have anything to regret now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think I'd better call it a day," Grace said to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright." Jason smiled gently. He had achieved his purpose today anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only reason he brought her here today was to let the others see her by his side so that the upper-class circle knows that she was still his woman. That way, no one would dare lay a finger on her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Also&hellip; he wanted to let Brian know that she was back with him and stop him from thinking about her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason prepared to walk toward the banquet's exit with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before they even took two steps, Brian suddenly grabbed Grace's wrist and stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why be with him when you don't love him anymore?" "Brian asked, staring at Grace as if he needed to get an answer from her today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's my business! You don't seem to be in a position to ask, Mr. Hart," said Grace as she tried to pull her hand away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian did not let go. His phoenix eyes continued to stare seriously at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked back at Brian and smiled suddenly. With everyone watching, he put his arm around Grace's waist. "Brian, do you have to embarrass everyone? Grace was with me and is still with me. Is there a problem with that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened, but instead of resisting Jason's sudden embrace, she looked at Brian before saying, "It's my business who I want to be with, Mr. Hart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, she pulled her hand smoothly out of his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Grace and Jason leaving, Brian felt an emptiness in his hand that extended to his heart. It was as if he was losing something very important&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian..." Stella tugged at Brian's arm, not liking the way he looked at Grace's back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What had been delight earlier now turned to jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why does Brian care so much about Grace when in his mind, I'm the girl who saved his life when he was a child?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you say you would introduce me to some people and help me make more connections?" grumbled Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian then looked at Stella who was next to him. "I'm a little tired today. I'll ask someone to take you to meet some producers and directors later.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was unwilling! It would only show how much Brian valued her if he took her to meet those people himself! Others would also think more highly of her that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were someone else, then it would belittle her status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Stella seemed reluctant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian had already summoned an entertainment industry veteran who was also at the banquet today and asked him to take Stella to meet some people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how reluctant Stella was, she could only leave with the veteran.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took a glass of wine from a tray held by a waiter and began to drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason can't get over Grace after all.'</p></div>
