        <h1>Chapter 4142</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler's gaze turned to Mr. Perkins again, his expression cold, "You want Tina to apologize and compensate for medical expenses?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I..." Mr. Perkins dared to be arrogant towards Tina, but not towards Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, everyone knew what kind of character the heir of the Hunter family had. They all knew it in private.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, the Hunter family is also one of the Crypt families. No one knows how strong their power is.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If they really provoke Chandler, who knows what kind of consequences they will face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I still think you've tainted Tina's eyes!" Chandler said, raising his hand and knocking Mr. Perkins down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina was dumbfounded. She originally thought that Chandler would blame her for her impulsive action, but who would have thought that he would be the one to act.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler looked down at Mr. Perkins, "Now, I'm hitting you too. You can call the police. When we get to the police station, I will naturally pay for the medical expenses!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Perkins was in pain and could only groan on the ground. He mentioned calling the police just to scare Tina. After all, White Maple Group was not messing around, he just wanted to gain the upper hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But who would have known that Chandler would be so tough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler walked back to Tina's side and said, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, okay, but we should find a doctor to check on Kit first," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Get in the car first!" Chandler said, suddenly pulling Tina away from Kit and taking care of Kit himself, "I'll support him, you walk ahead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina agreed. After all, in terms of height and strength, it was indeed more suitable for Chandler to support Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, um... Chandler usually doesn't like physical contact with unfamiliar people, but now he willingly supports Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It feels like something is changing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the three of them got in the car, Kit spoke, "I'll just go back to the residence. This minor injury doesn't need to be seen by a doctor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But your face hurts, right? Anyway, it's safer to have a doctor take a look."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Rather than seeing a doctor, I don't want my face to trend online tomorrow," Kit avoids Tina's gaze. He shouldn't continue to get involved with her. If he continues to stay by her side, accepting her help, he's afraid he'll become greedy, afraid he'll expect more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more expectations he has, the more disappointments he'll experience. He understood this long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina is still worried, "But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I will find the Hunter family's private doctor to examine you, so you don't have to worry about being discovered," Chandler suddenly speaks up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon hearing this, Kit doesn't refuse anymore. He lowers his head, his eyelids drooping, and tightly clasps his hands in front of him, as if contemplating something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In this moment, Tina can't help but see Kit as a helpless little white flower!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Initially, she thought that with his background, he wouldn't encounter such situations in the entertainment industry. But she didn't expect it to happen like this, and from Mr. Perkins' conversation with him earlier, it was clear that Kit's father specifically sent him to attend this dinner party in order to gain better resources!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, is today the first time this has happened? Or has it happened before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What burden does Kit carry behind his glamorous appearance?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This is a question Tina never thought about before, but now she starts to ponder!</p></div>
