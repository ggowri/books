        <h1>Chapter 2792</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened?" Brian asked, looking at Valda Theller's suddenly serious expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's about Kyla," said Valda Theller as she held the phone between herself and Brian so they could both watch the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was in some hall, surrounded by reporters who kept raising tough questions. All of them seemed to focus on &lsquo;divorce&rsquo; and &lsquo;illness&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's answered the reporters, "We're not divorced. Martin Weiss and I are in a stable marriage, and as to why he brought Shana Nicholls to the banquet you mentioned that day, it&rsquo;s because Shana Nicholls is my husband's private nurse. I wasn't feeling well that day, so she attended it instead of me. I didn't think it would lead to a misunderstanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does that mean Mr. Martin Weiss has a problem with his health?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My husband needed a nurse because he donated his liver to me twice. I probably wouldn't have survived if it hadn't been for my husband. He's doing well. Otherwise, the doctors wouldn't have discharged him. We hired a professional nurse to take care of him because I wanted someone to take care of him when I'm not around," replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it okay that you two live apart? Since your husband donated his liver to you twice, shouldn't you stay with him and take care of him yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I gave birth and had the second liver transplant surgery simultaneously, so I'm not well enough to care for a patient. I stay in Emerald City because I want to care for my mother, and my eldest son goes to school here. I hope to move back to L City after my eldest son finishes his studies this semester."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard you run a store. You're Martin Weiss's wife. The Weiss family can easily afford a better house for you and your children. Besides that, you won't have to take care of your children and run a store at the same time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My mother mainly runs the store. I'm only helping her out. I might be Martin Weiss's wife, but my mother doesn't want to rely on the Weiss family and wants to earn her own living. As her daughter, I can't say much about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why are you living in a humble house behind the store with your children? Besides, you seem to have lived there for years, and you only got married about a year ago but your eldest son is already 10 years old. Does this mean you two don't really have a good relationship and maybe you wouldn't have gotten married if you hadn&rsquo;t gotten pregnant with your second child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I got pregnant with our second child because we have a good relationship. I had low self-esteem and thought I wasn&rsquo;t good enough for Martin. But I gradually got over it because Martin was persistent. I'll move back to L City and live with Martin in the future. I also want people to stop speculating about our relationship!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's answer was almost textbook, giving a picture of marital stability while also shaping a good image of her husband, Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did Valda Theller realize that Kyla's husband was Martin Weiss, the chairman of Weiss Group in L City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Weiss family of L City was affluent!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla's husband donated his liver to Kyla twice, so they must have a good relationship," murmured Valda Theller. Then, she asked Brian, "Do you know Martin Weiss?"</p></div>
