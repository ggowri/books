        <h1>Chapter 2221</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your hand..." Kyla's eyes fell on Martin Weiss's right hand, which was bandaged. When he entered the private room, there were no traces of blood. His bandages were white, and she could see some blood oozing faintly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He followed her gaze and looked down at his hand. He said, "It's nothing. I guess the wound tore open," he spoke nonchalantly as if it was only a minor issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla recalled how Mr. Lambert had rushed at her in the private room and how Martin Weiss knocked him down to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was probably how his wound tore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bloodstain on his bandages was getting darker, and it was gradually expanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly said to Martin Weiss, "Get in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" He froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get in the car. I'll accompany you to the hospital first. You need a doctor to tend to the wound on your hand again," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that he was still standing blankly where he was, she took his wrist, took him to the car parked in front of them, and said to the driver, "Go to the hospital!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver hesitated for a moment. Seeing that Martin Weiss was silent, the driver started the car and drove toward the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss seemed to finally come to his senses. She was sitting beside him, and they were sharing the same car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for today," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss paused before saying, "You don't have to thank me. You probably got into such an awkward meal because of me." He could see that they were trying to use her to get him to join their meal so that they would have the opportunity to talk business with him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, these people did not know the real nature of their relationship, or they would not have said such things before he came or forced her to make a call to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Those people didn't do anything to you, did they?" he asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head. "They only spoke harshly. They did no real harm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The next time this happens, just call me and let me take care of it," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said nothing in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss then asked, "Is that woman in the private room your friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I knew her from prison. We shared a cell. When the other inmates bullied me, she didn't. She would also help me out sometimes, so I owed her a favor," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect Jacqueline Bowman to be so calculating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss heard her talk about her time in prison, his heart could not help aching. 'Yes, I sent her to prison and didn't know just how much she suffered there until I looked into it afterward.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the results of his investigations might just be the tip of the iceberg. He might still be clueless about some of the more painful and torturous incidents. After all, he only looked into the matter two years after she was released from prison.</p></div>
