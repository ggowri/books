        <h1>Chapter 3493</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William?" she couldn't help but shout. His embrace was too tight, making it hard for her to breathe and causing her bones to ache a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" He suddenly snapped out of it and quickly withdrew his arm, saying "Sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with you? You look really pale," she stared at his pale cheeks, then raised her hand and wiped away the thin layer of sweat on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she was the one who was originally afraid, it seems like he has become the fearful one now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much, I guess I'm just a bit tired from rushing to Emerald City today," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well then, you should rest early. Come on, go to sleep now!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was a VIP ward, and even the bed for the night attendant was quite spacious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper took the initiative to pull William to the bed where the night attendant would sleep, and pushed him onto the bed. "Alright, you sleep!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was a bit speechless. "Jasper, you're the patient!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't get hurt that badly! You sleep first, and when you fall asleep, I'll go to sleep!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her determined eyes, he had no choice but to lie down on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, close your eyes and go to sleep," she said, humming the tune of a lullaby softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gentle melody relaxed his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, don't you still need to find Lawrence?" William suddenly said out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's body stiffened for a moment, then she lowered her eyelids gently and said, "Um, I... have to find him." Regardless of whether he is alive or dead, or what he has become, she wants to find Lawrence and apologize to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though many people have told her that Lawrence is likely no longer alive and even if he were found, it wouldn't make much difference, there's no need to keep worrying about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this kind of concern has unconsciously become a habit for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I will continue to help you search until we find it!" William said, closing his eyes as if he had fallen asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's nose feels a bit sour, and it seems like William always understands her the most. It's really nice to be able to know William and become friends like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the Abbott family hadn't had an accident and Lawrence hadn't gone missing, then Lawrence would have definitely become very good friends with William!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, thank you," Jasper murmured softly. After a while, he returned to his own bed, lay down again, and closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the hospital room, it became quiet and still. After some time, William, who was lying on the accompanying bed, slowly opened his eyes and turned his head to look at Jasper on the other bed not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He will help her find Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he knew that Lawrence had become a thorn in her heart, he believed that only by truly finding Lawrence could he remove this thorn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, her heart will always be thinking of Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he's afraid that if Lawrence is still alive and appears in front of her, her thoughts of him will turn into romantic feelings, he still wants to take a chance. He wants to bet that he is more important to her than Lawrence, that his years of love for her are much deeper than Lawrence's love for her in less than a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He bets that she will fall in love with him in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, he will help her fulfill this wish and help her find Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Jasper took the initiative to visit Veronica's hospital room and asked about her condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, Mason had also been in Veronica's hospital room yesterday, but she hadn't woken up yet.</p></div>
