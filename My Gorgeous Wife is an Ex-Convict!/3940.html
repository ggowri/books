        <h1>Chapter 3938</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy followed Mick to a members-only upscale restaurant in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy had only heard of this restaurant from Clarissa before, who had boasted about being invited to dine there with her friends in a haughty tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Clarissa isn't qualified to become a member of this restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's clear that getting into this restaurant is not an easy task.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy watched as the restaurant staff treated Mick with respect, and caught a glimpse of herself in the mirrored wall, feeling surreal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had actually made it to the restaurant that Clarissa had deemed difficult to enter, but it had become so simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, it should be said that it was Mick who made it simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once they were in the private room, Mick had the staff hand Nancy the menu.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Order whatever you like," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You order, I don't know what's good here, and I'm not picky," Nancy replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick then told the staff, "Just bring the usual."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, Mr. Reed," the staff member left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at Mick and said, "Mr. Reed, if you need to see me in the future, you can just call me. You don't have to come to my hotel to pick me up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick raised an eyebrow, "Don't want me to pick you up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm just afraid it will be a burden for you. Yesterday, some of my colleagues saw you standing up for me, and they were already talking about it. Although they haven't recognized you as Mr. Reed yet, if they see you more often, they might figure it out," Nancy explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Mick was somewhat interested in her, but if they were to become the subject of gossip or rumors, it could cause trouble for him as a wealthy young man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps at that time, regardless of whether he was still interested in her or not, he would just keep his distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least, before Clarissa received the punishment she deserved, Nancy didn't want things to turn out that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if someone recognizes us, it doesn't matter," Mick said. "Or are you afraid of being discovered with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why would I be afraid?" Nancy's lips were slightly dry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sometimes, the higher you are lifted up, the harder you fall. Are you prepared for that?" Mick suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy shuddered, then understood what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He and she had a flirtation. If others found out, with Mick's status, many people would naturally lift her up. But if in the future, Mick confirmed that he didn't like her, that it was just a passing interest, then when Mick left, it would be her time to fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy laughed lightly. "I can handle it. Anyway, I had nothing to begin with, so it would just be going back to where I started."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To her, even if it was dust, it was nothing. She had nothing left to lose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's eyes flickered slightly, and the self-mocking curve of her lips made him feel a little uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, you won't have nothing. Even if it really comes to that, I'll give you some money to at least improve your life."</p></div>
