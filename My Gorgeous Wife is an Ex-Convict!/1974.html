        <h1>Chapter 1972</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He rubbed his temples as he looked at her. "Are you going to come to my room from today onward to bond with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you think it&rsquo;s doable, that&rsquo;d be best,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was speechless as he drew close to her and pushed her up against a nearby cabinet. "Lina, am I not a man to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Did she know how much restraint he needed to fight his desire when she lay by his side at night, with her arms grabbing him from time to time and her thigh resting on his lap across the pregnancy pillow?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I&rsquo;ve never thought of you as a woman!" she answered immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was between laughter and tears. "You sure do trust me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said matter-of-factly, "Who else am I going to trust if not you? You didn't even have your way with me after what happened to you yesterday!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she said left Hadwin Stephenson speechless for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at her blankly. He recalled what had happened the night before because of what she just said. Her lips were so soft, her breath was so sweet, and it felt so good to kiss her... What happened the night before passed through his mind again, and his blood seemed to be boiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's come over you? You look a little..." Before she could finish, he suddenly flung his arms around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She froze. "Hadwin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let me hold you like this for a while," he murmured as he tried to hold her in his arms for an eternity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She stiffened slightly as if remembering the night before. 'He didn't get drugged today, but he did drink during dinner. He's not gonna...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin, I... I'm still pregnant. I&hellip; I can't do that sort of thing, but if you really have needs, I can fulfill you another way..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is that all you think about?" Though he said so, his arms closed a little closer around her. However, he was careful not to press against her belly. "Don't worry, I won't do anything to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">More than anyone else, he wanted her and the baby to be okay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"And... what happened yesterday won't happen again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What happened yesterday? Did you really... take something you shouldn't have taken?" she asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stiffened. "Do you really want to know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The inquiry seemed to carry an inestimable weight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze and then hummed a reply. 'Yes, I want to know everything about you&mdash;good and bad!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to know what had happened to him yesterday!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson muttered, "I drank the wrong glass of wine. It was spiked, and the person who handed me the wine was my mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was stunned. 'His mother drugged him?'</p></div>
