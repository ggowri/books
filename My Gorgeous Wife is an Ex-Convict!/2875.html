        <h1>Chapter 2873</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All her struggles ended in sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why didn't I fight to the end?' she asked herself. Brian was so drunk that she could not find the opportunity to escape even if she wanted. She finally chose to give up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe... she wanted one last fling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to feel him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was drunk, and perhaps he would not remember anything. However, Valda Theller was sober and remembered every detail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, why are you in a trance?" The next morning, Camille Strickland came to see her best friend. Due to what had happened at the comic fiesta, she would accompany her best friend whenever she was free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... It's nothing." Valda Theller came to her senses and shook her head quickly. She recalled the night before again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, the news about what happened to you at... uh... the comic fiesta has been deleted. You can no longer find them online. Do you think Brian did this?" Camille Strickland speculated. After all, few people in Emerald City could do that in such a short time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not sure," answered Valda Theller. The mention of Brian's name made her nervous for some reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said emotionally, "Oh, I wonder what your uncle's family will do next. They'll do anything for money! By the way, your cousin said that your uncle is hospitalized. Is it true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Whether it's true or not, they won't stop at nothing. We'll find out if it's true eventually."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're right," said Camille Strickland. Suddenly, she stared at a spot on Valda Theller's neck. "Wait, did you get a bug bite on your neck? It's so red."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze and saw her best friend leaning over to look closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah. It's... It's probably a mosquito bite!" Valda Theller immediately yanked the collar and covered her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She recalled the redness her best friend said. It was the hickey Brian had left on her body last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why is your face suddenly red?" Camille Strickland asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's hot," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're right. It's quite hot today. You even wore a semi-high collar top. Do you want to get a heatstroke?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Valda Theller was speechless. She would not be able to hide the red marks on her neck if she did not wear this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "I&rsquo;ll change my clothes later. Also, you don't need to keep accompanying me. I&rsquo;ll be okay. If you accompany me every day, I&rsquo;ll feel as if something's wrong with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you're okay?" Camille Strickland looked at her best friend carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled nonchalantly. "I just got mobbed, became famous online, and had a breakup. Maybe I won't think it's a big deal when I look back years later. Don't worry. My parents risked their lives keeping me alive. I'll cherish it and live a good life so I won't do them wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was a little relieved to hear her best friend say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'll stop by less often, but be sure to call me if you need company," she reminded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Camille Strickland left, Valda Theller cleaned up and left the apartment with her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she reached the entrance of the pharmacy, she took a deep breath as if she was mentally preparing herself before finally stepping into the pharmacy.</p></div>
