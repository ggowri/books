        <h1>Chapter 1068</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman fled the scene almost immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn saw this and smiled faintly. Martin Weiss had always been proud. How could he be so easily seduced?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was once drugged by a starlet who wanted to have one night of passion with him, but he would rather endure the effect and leave than let her touch him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, the starlet suffered a terrible end, and that night... Kyla Corbyn shook her head hard at the thought of that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop thinking about it. It&rsquo;s only a nightmare!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only good thing Martin Weiss gave her was Nelson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after she pushed the memories away, she looked at him out of the corners of her eyes and saw his deep eyes looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stiffened immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, she seemed to have frozen, staring blankly at him as if she could not take her eyes off his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were like a dense net that enveloped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn did not know how long it had been, but a voice suddenly rang in her ears. "Hey, boss lady. What is this&hellip; affectionate staring? Why don't you stare into our eyes too&hellip;" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The stench of alcohol immediately rushed into Kyla Corbyn's nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned her head and saw two drunks looking at her maliciously, one of whom was about to touch her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly stepped aside, putting a distance between them. She looked at them suspiciously. 'These... are not the same people who used to give me trouble. Did they&hellip; switch their people?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are they going to molest me today?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, why did you dodge? You're pretty. Here, kiss me. I'll pay you later and you can live a good life. You don't have to&hellip; Burp&hellip; Set up your food stall anymore&hellip;" He burped and jumped at Kyla Corbyn as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn dodged again. "I'll call the police if you do that again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already two o'clock in the morning. The streets were deserted except for a few stall owners and a few passersby who evidently did not want any trouble. They merely looked on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure... Call... the police. We're not afraid of anyone..." He laughed and jumped at Kyla Corbyn again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While dodging, Kyla Corbyn took her phone out of her pocket and was about to dial the number when it was suddenly waved away by another man. The phone then dropped to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two drunks surrounded Kyla Corbyn, and she dodged in a panic. Suddenly, one of them wrapped his arms around her and his fat lips were about to kiss her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a foot suddenly kicked the man who was going to kiss Kyla Corbyn. The man was kicked to the ground, but because his arms were still around Kyla Corbyn, she was about to fall with him too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An arm was suddenly wrapped around Kyla Corbyn's waist. The next moment, she was caught in a wide embrace. A familiar scent immediately enveloped her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stared blankly at Martin Weiss who was holding her.</p></div>
