        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence Klein shifted in the front seat of the car and considered his options.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His boss, Jason Reed, had approached the group near the sports car. The headlights showed the woman on the ground and the three men.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He better not go crazy&hellip;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence had seen his boss Jason lose it before.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was terrifying.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced around, gauging if there were any traffic cameras on this deserted stretch of road or if there were any other bystanders who might witness Jason killing somebody.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He prayed it wouldn&rsquo;t go that far.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he knew Jason and what he was capable of.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was going to be bloody, and brutal.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tonight, the road had already been closed, so who would have expected that five people and a Ferrari would break in here?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">They&rsquo;d disturbed Jason, who wanted to be alone.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Every year on this day, Jason always closed this whole road and stayed on it alone, wearing old clothes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one dared to ask the reason as if it were taboo.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence who had worked for Jason all these years didn&rsquo;t know the reason either.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, as he watched his boss lift a heavyset man with ease and slam his head against the wall over and over, he did not know whether he should stop him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Beating up some would-be rapists was one thing. Killing them&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t be so easy to overlook. Or clean up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And the men on this road were driving a Ferrari not a Ford.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Which meant, like Jason, they had money.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He started toward Jason and then paused when just as suddenly, his boss stopped fighting the man.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Stop. Please.&rdquo; Grace touched the stranger&rsquo;s arm. "If you punch him again, he'll die."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So what?" the man said. He balled his fist as Christopher slid down the wall.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was stunned. It wasn't until this moment that she really was able to see the man clearly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was handsome. With dark eyes and a strong jaw. Full lips and a strong body.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His hair was longer on top and stylishly messy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Christopher shuffled back and got to his feet, the man took a menacing step toward him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Grace said. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man&rsquo;s dark eyes cut into her. He looked deadly and still as if people's lives meant nothing to him at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace took a deep breath and said, "It is not worth being imprisoned for a lowlife like him."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man didn&rsquo;t nod nor move, but she sensed him relaxing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Christopher took advantage of the pause to grab his friends and get back into his car. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for this!&rdquo; he screamed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace didn&rsquo;t know if he was addressing her, the stranger, or maybe both.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whatever there wasn&rsquo;t much Christopher could do that she hadn&rsquo;t already experienced in prison.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The woman who&rsquo;d been with these bastards stuck her head out of the car. &ldquo;Holy sh*t! Is that Jason Reed!?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other three men looked at her with shock as they climbed into the car and one asked, &ldquo;Jason Reed, the richest man in the city? No fucking way."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace understood their confusion.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man&mdash;her savior&mdash;wore old clothes. He looked&hellip; as broken as she did.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was no billionaire. His jacket was threadbare, and his face was haunted.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Christopher peeled out with his asshole buddies.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace watched the car tear up the street. When the road was once again quiet, she looked back at the man.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace hesitantly said, "Thank you&hellip; for saving me back there."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He grunted, but beyond that, didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he walked across to the other side of the road, he sat down with his back against the wall.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was cold and windy. And the temperature was due to drop even lower. If he were to sleep on the road for the night, would he be alive tomorrow morning?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After considering that the man had saved her, Grace started walking over to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s been a rough night. Aren&rsquo;t you going home now? Where is your family? Do you have their phone number? I can help you call them and ask them to pick you up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He slowly raised his head and Grace saw&hellip; death.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was the same darkness she&rsquo;d seen in her own eyes too many times when she&rsquo;d been in prison.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The kind of darkness that spoke of nothing to live for. No hope.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you have nowhere to stay, you can stay with me," she said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">***</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace did not expect to bring a stranger back to her apartment. She wasn&rsquo;t impulsive by nature, and she certainly hadn&rsquo;t dated anyone or even considered hooking up with a man since her experience with Sean.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But this man had saved her from rape, maybe even death.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She shuddered at the thought.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those men, the three of them were soulless&hellip; and how could that woman watch on while she was beaten up? As an attorney, she would&rsquo;ve fought hard to see all of them in prison for their crimes or complacency in it. But life had taught her that the innocent rarely prevailed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And life was never fair.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">So why did she bring this man home?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hmm. Perhaps she wasn&rsquo;t ready to concede just yet.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her apartment wasn&rsquo;t large. It was just one room with a small kitchen and bathroom. She grabbed a blanket from the closet and laid it on the floor. She took her pillow from the bed and placed it on the ground.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The bathroom is just through there,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He crossed to it and closed the door behind him. The water kicked on a moment later.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the man came out of the bathroom, his hair was wet. He had washed his hair and face. His sleeves were rolled up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at the man's wet hair, Grace fetched a towel and said, "Bend over, please."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man fixed his eyes on her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I just want to help you dry your hair with a towel. I have no bad intentions," she said. "If you don't dry your wet hair, you could easily catch a cold."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He still gazed at her but slowly complied. After a few minutes, he asked in a deep voice, "Are you concerned about me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes." Grace did not avoid eye contact with him. "After bringing you to my home, I don't want you to get sick."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">With his eyes taking her in like she was some oddity, he slowly bent over.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Toweling his wet hair, Grace asked, "What's your name?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He remained silent for a long time, but finally answered, "Jay."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay," Grace repeated his name. It was a very common name, so Grace didn&rsquo;t think much about it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;My name is Grace. Where do you live? What about your family?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't have any family," he responded.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She suddenly stopped.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">How sad. No one should be alone.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had people before&mdash;but they&rsquo;d turned their backs on her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Looks like we're in the same boat," she said with a bitter smile on her face as she continued to towel his hair dry.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She rose and got a comb and came back to him. These were small gestures&mdash;intimate ones&mdash;to touch his hair and smooth it away from his face. But this stranger&mdash;Jay&mdash;had risked his life for her. It was the least she could do.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she pushed his hair back, the true features of his face were revealed. He was a devastatingly attractive man. Strong jaw. Full mouth. Dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eyes that were inches from hers and searing her in the place where she stood.</p></div>
