        <h1>Chapter 2730</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller replied in acknowledgment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes fell on Grace's bulging belly. "I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to attend such a banquet in your condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine. I&rsquo;m at home most of the time that I&rsquo;m getting bored, so I asked Jay to bring me to the banquet," said Grace. Then, she praised Valda Theller's appearance today. "Valda, you look beautiful today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Valda Theller smiled shyly. "Brian helped me with it. It's my first time attending such a banquet, so I don't know much about the right etiquette to have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her frankness made Grace like her more. "You'll get used to it later," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll get used to it?' Valda Theller blinked. 'Does that mean I'll have to accompany Brian to more banquets like this in the future?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I can tell Brian is attentive to you,&rdquo; Grace added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I know. He's nice," Valda Theller said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said to Grace, "You shouldn't stand for too long. Why don't you find a place nearby to sit and talk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace could speak, Brian said, "Let's find a seat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The four went to a corner of the banquet. Brian said to Valda Theller, "I brought you some food earlier, but... I put it aside earlier. I'll get you some more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller knew Brian was referring to the trouble Phoebe Cross had caused earlier. He must have quickly put aside the food he got and went over to stand up for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, okay," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian got up to go to the dining area. Jason also got up and said, "I'll go with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men left, leaving the two women looking at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could not help but size up Grace. The last time they met in the shopping mall, she did not know Grace was the woman Brian loved. She knew that this time, so she looked at Grace differently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out... the woman Brian loved deeply was such a person. She was not stunning at first glance, but she was quiet and elegant. The more one looked at her, the more one felt comfortable with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like that?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller came to her senses and scratched her head sheepishly. "I just think you're good-looking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chuckled. "I don't look good at the moment. My face has swollen a lot since I got pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I think you're really good-looking. The more I look at you, the more beautiful you are. No wonder Brian liked you..." said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice broke off instantly, and her expression turned slightly awkward. She spoke so fast that she slipped her tongue just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace did not shy away from it. Instead, she said, "Do you know about my and Brian's history?" After all, it was no secret. Not only in high society, but one could also find relevant information about it online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only know Brian used to like you," Valda Theller said honestly.</p></div>
