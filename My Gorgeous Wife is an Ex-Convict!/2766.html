        <h1>Chapter 2764</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean? You won't lend us money? You've got your own studio now, and I know your comic is being adapted into a TV show, so I'm sure you're getting a lot of royalties from it. We're only borrowing some money from you so that we can buy your cousin a house and let him get married as soon as possible. Do you want to ruin your cousin's happiness?" Rowena Santiago asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller replied coldly, "Stop trying to blackmail me using your words. I'm not obliged to lend you money. Don't you think it's ridiculous to borrow money to buy a house when you already have one?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... You..." Rowena Santiago glared at Valda Theller, not expecting the obedient niece who would lend them money almost every time they asked for it to change so suddenly. "If you won't lend us money, your dad won't be happy if your cousin's marriage fails!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My dad would&rsquo;ve fallen out with you long ago if he were still around. Besides, I have transfer records of all the money you borrowed from me over the years. Aunt, are you just going to take it and not pay it back?" Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago did not expect that not only did she not get any money, but Valda Theller also asked her to pay back the money. She immediately snapped. "We deserve that money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's for worthy elders. You don't deserve it!" Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago slapped Valda Theller mercilessly in the face. Her face was instantly red and swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a burning pain on her face, Valda Theller just looked at her coldly. "I won't lend you any money. I'll call the police if you refuse to leave. There&rsquo;s surveillance in my studio. The slap you gave me has been caught on video and will be used as evidence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instantly alarmed, Rowena Santiago looked up to see that there was indeed a surveillance camera in the corner of the ceiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately glared at Valda Theller. "Fine. You're tough. Just wait and see!" With that said, she turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finally slumped onto the couch like she was exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought her uncle and aunt adopted her out of kindness. She had no idea they were after the 1.8 million dollars compensation and half of her grandfather's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had tried her best to please them all these years, wanting to be a real family. However, their greedy requests disappointed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They just took what she gave for granted and would yell at her as they did just now if she refused only once!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The so-called borrowing... was just them taking her money for nothing. Her uncle and aunt never paid back the money they borrowed. They never even wrote an IOU.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked down as her eyes watered. Finally, tears slowly poured out and dripped on the back of her hand, then the bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the bracelet with tears in her eyes. 'Will I ever have a real family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will I have a family again when Brian falls in love with me?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned when he saw the bruise on Valda Theller's face. "What happened? Did someone slap you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller subconsciously wanted to hide it, but Brian spoke first, "I can tell that you have a bruise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller bit her lip and said, "I argued with my aunt yesterday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did you argue about?" he asked.</p></div>
