        <h1>Chapter 2133</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's all we got from the check-up so far. Some of the stimulants we did were completely ineffective on the patient," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney cried their eyes out after hearing the result.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked stupefied. It was as if there was dead silence in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the more he did that, the more worried Grace became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps it would be better if Hadwin Stephenson cried like Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney. However, Hadwin Stephenson was suppressing all his emotions in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was afraid that Hadwin Stephenson would do something extreme, so she said to him, "Lina won't sleep forever. If Emerald City's doctors can't cure her, we'll get doctors from all over the country. Or we can get the best doctors in the world. Don't let yourself get depressed. Lina and the baby need you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The baby..." What Grace said seemed to trigger Hadwin Stephenson as he suddenly laughed. Then, he said to Grace, "What do I need this baby for? Lina wouldn't be unconscious now if she wasn't trying to give birth to this baby. She shouldn't&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A slap hit Hadwin Stephenson hard in the face. It was from Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, Lina risked her life to give birth to this baby. What will she think if she wakes up and finds out that you&rsquo;re treating the baby she values more than her life like this? Will she regret loving the wrong man?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson staggered, his eyes full of utter pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Two feelings, love and hatred, kept tearing at him. In the end, he slumped down on the couch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace sighed. Her hand still hurt when she exited the ward. She did slap him hard, but she did not want Hadwin Stephenson to have so much hatred for a newborn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina... cherished the baby very much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla, who walked out of the ward with her, seemed deep in thought. It was as if she was thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter, Kyla?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm wondering if that little boy can wake Lina up? He only fed Lina some blood in the delivery room and she woke up. With Lina's current situation, if we feed her the little boy's blood again..." Kyla spoke out her speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's eyes lit up. 'Yes, that little boy... Why didn't I think of that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, we must find that little boy. We must find that boy. Perhaps he can save Lina!" Grace said excitedly. Then, she said to Kyla, "I'll go find Jay and tell him to find that little boy right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Grace impatiently rushed out of the hospital. Kyla looked at her best friend's rapidly retreating figure and sighed in relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She hoped the little boy could wake Lina up when they found him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Jason... should be able to find the little boy, right?' She thought to herself. Moments later, Kyla hesitantly took out her phone and called Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, I hope you can do me a favor!"</p></div>
