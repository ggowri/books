        <h1>Chapter 1491</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A frightened and stammering voice sounded from the other end of the line. "We... went to Young Madam's room. Huang Qian and the caregiver had passed out in the room, and Young Madam was nowhere to be seen. There's no surveillance camera... in the bedroom, but the surveillance cameras outside show that Young Madam never left the bedroom. Also, there was a lingering smell of knockout drops... in the bedroom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Find her! Find Young Madam even if you have to turn the whole house upside down!" said Jason as he threw the phone back to Terrence. He stared at Secretary Wang as if he were about to kill him. He used a hand to grab the older man by the hair as he pushed him against the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Speak, what have you done with Grace? I'll kill you if anything happens to her!" With a thump, Secretary Wang's head hit the wall hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Secretary Wang laughed. "Young Master, I won't tell you even if you kill me. You'll know when the time comes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Speak!" Jason aggressively slammed Secretary Wang's head against the wall. At the moment, all he could think about was Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Horrified, Terrence looked at his boss who had intense rage on his face. To Master Reed, Grace was someone nobody could touch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If this went on, Secretary Wang's life would probably end here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Thinking of this, Terrence quickly said, "Master Reed, why don't you take Secretary Wang back to Reed Residence first? Secretary Wang must know something else. If you really cause him to&hellip; get hospitalized, I'm afraid we won&rsquo;t be able to get anything out of him then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence tried to be tactful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His words slightly calmed Jason down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Take him with us to Reed Residence!" With that said, Jason dropped Secretary Wang and quickly walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence hurriedly asked two bodyguards to pick up Secretary Wang and followed after Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back in Reed Residence, Jason rushed straight to the bedroom where trained hounds were barking at the bottom of his bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Move the bed!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everyone immediately caught sight of a secret passage when the bed was lifted away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's face paled instantly. He... had no idea that there was such an opening in the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What's with this opening? Has it always been here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Security guards had begun to investigate the opening that led to a tunnel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Secretary Wang was brought to the room, a satisfied smile appeared on his face. 'Everything's going well!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason suddenly grabbed Secretary Wang's collar and said, "Did you know there&rsquo;s a secret passage here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, Old Master told me about it. He built this residence, so naturally, the most detailed construction blueprints were also in his hands. He also got them to retain the secret passage," said Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason had roughly figured out what was going on without needing Secretary Wang to say it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang had shown up on purpose to lure him out, and once he went out, someone else took the opportunity to pass through this secret passage and take Grace away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed had probably planned it before his death and handed the task to Secretary Wang to execute!</p></div>
