        <h1>Chapter 3033</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day's comic exchange meeting, Brian attended as a participant with Valda as his translator. Valda was in awe as she watched Brian fluently converse with comic artists from other countries in their native language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You should know that he doesn't just communicate with others in English, he also knows Japanese, Korean, and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda feels that it's necessary to refresh her understanding of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And he knows even the most specialized terminology, sometimes even better than the professional translators present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were several translators, some even came over to talk to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How many languages have you actually learned?" Valda asked in a moment of pause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just six languages, and for the others, I only know a little bit," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Six countries?!" Valda gasped. If he only knows a little bit of the other languages, then he must be fluent in these six languages?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He's really a language genius!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to him, she felt like a language idiot. Even the only language she had been studying for years, English, she had to work hard to pick up and only managed to have basic conversations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know, if I had met you when I was studying, maybe my grades would have improved dramatically, and I might have learned a few more languages," Valda sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong with now? You don't have to study hard, I can help you translate," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda realized he was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the communication meeting, Valda also met many of her admired comic artists. Of course, she couldn't miss the opportunity to get their autographs and take pictures with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After learning that Valda and Brian were in a romantic relationship, the comic artists all gave their blessings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda had a pleasant few days at the exchange meeting. She not only got closer to many comic artists, but also discussed various comic techniques and their views on the future of comics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda feels that she has gained a lot in these past few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the day, she often discussed various issues with the cartoonists, and Brian was the best translator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, she and Brian wandered around the streets and alleys of Deer Capital, as if they were tourists visiting the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a pity that some places can only be visited during the day," Valda regrets this fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to, you can stay here for a few more days when the time comes," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about your job?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"For work, I can arrange it. A few days' time can be adjusted," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She couldn't help but say, "Brian, are you being too accommodating to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want to accommodate you more," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I just want to treat her better, so well that she can't let go of me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the exchange meeting ended, Valda and Brian decided to stay in Deer Capital for three more days to do some sightseeing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the very first day, an unexpected situation occurred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was surprised to see Simon appear in front of them, and stared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George apologized and said, "Simon really wants to see you again. Do you plan to stay in Deer Capital for a while? I also want to show my gratitude for saving Simon last time. I haven't properly thanked you yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need to be polite," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian doesn't really like George, so he says, "Mr. Gregory, my girlfriend and I already have plans for today, so we appreciate your kindness, but we want to explore Deer Capital on our own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This statement is equivalent to a refusal, and someone like George naturally understands it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Well... it would indeed be inconvenient to disturb you," said George, then he lowered his head and said to his son, "Alright, you've met Auntie Valda and Uncle Brian, let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was about to take his son's hand when Simon took a big step forward and went straight to Valda, grabbing her hand. "I want to play with you guys, is that okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"?" Valda was surprised, "You want to join us?"</p></div>
