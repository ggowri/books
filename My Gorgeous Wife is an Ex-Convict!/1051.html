        <h1>Chapter 1050</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella felt jealous when she saw Brian's eyes chasing Grace's back. "I wonder what's going on between Grace and Jason? Although they&rsquo;ve broken up, I heard they're still in touch with each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The latter part was just an offhand remark by Stella intended to make Brian dislike Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, once she said so, Brian turned his head and looked at her with a cold, sharp look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella trembled, feeling as though he had seen through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stella, you should know that Grace is the one I love. I don't want you to talk bad about her in front of me anymore," Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella stammered, "I... I wasn&rsquo;t. I'm just&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You just what?" There was no emotion in those dark phoenix eyes. Accompanied with that cold voice, there seemed to be an invisible pressure that almost suffocated her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was somewhat startled. Ever since she assumed Grace's identity, Brian's attitude toward her had always been gentle and polite. He would always be tolerant even though she had done something wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was so cold right now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her mind flashed back to the online comments she previously read about Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Indifferent, hard-hearted, ruthless... Maybe this is the real him?&rsquo; The Brian she knew was just an illusion he gave her because he thought she was his savior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'His gentleness and tolerance are reserved for the little girl who saved him when he was a child! Not for the real me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is his gentle and tolerant side only reserved for Grace now that he has fallen in love with her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the idea crossed Stella's mind, she felt as if her body was getting colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said coldly, "Stella, you saved me, so I'll make sure you'll live a good life no matter what happens. It's just that all we have is the friendship we had when we were little."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella could only feel her cheeks burning. His words were like a slap in her face. Even though he made it subtle, Stella knew Brian was warning her not to have any funny ideas!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing behind Stella, the top manager's eyes twinkled when he heard what Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It seems that Young Master Hart has nothing more to do with Stella than their childhood friendship, yet Stella likes to brag about how close she is with Young Master Hart.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, the more attention one attracted, the more likely one would hit rock bottom. If she did provoke the crown prince until there was no affection left, she would probably be back to square one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The top manager looked at Stella coldly with a mixture of mockery and disdain in his eyes. Even though some people had the opportunity and resources, their vision and limitations doomed them to achieve nothing!</p></div>
