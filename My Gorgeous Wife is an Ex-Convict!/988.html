        <h1>Chapter 987</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I wonder what the others will think if they find out I treated two of the most powerful men in Emerald City&ndash;Jason and Brian&mdash;to dinner with only 378 dollars.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Grace found it funny when she thought of it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was tired when she returned to her rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She washed up and lay on her bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm so tired, but it's not my body that's tired, it's my mind.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian telling her that he had fallen for her was something she never expected, but she could not give him any response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even if Brian has fallen in love with me, what about the future? Perhaps his love for me will only last a few months? Maybe longer. A year? Two years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I don't want to fall in love anymore. The feeling of falling in love and getting dumped afterward... is just too painful!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could get over it the first and second time, but that did not mean she could still get over it the third time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace closed her eyes and allowed herself to empty her thoughts. She was already asleep when she was awakened by a knock on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It sounded urgent. Grace opened her eyes sleepily and walked to the door, shouting, "Who's there?" She looked at the time. It was already past 10 p.m.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins, it's me, Terrence!" From outside came Terrence's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surprised. She hesitated a little but opened the door anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To her surprise, there was not only Terrence at the door but Jason too. He was obviously drunk and half-leaning on Terrence. He was clearly intoxicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. Speaking of which, it seemed to be the first time she had seen such a drunk Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's drunk. You should take him back to Reed Residence," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence gave a wry smile. 'I know that, but the problem is that Master Reed insists on coming here. He also gave direct orders that if he&rsquo;s not in the rental house when he wakes up the next morning, I can just submit my resignation right away.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed insisted on coming here. Well... Miss Cummins, if it's convenient&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before Terrence could finish, Grace immediately said, "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was rendered speechless, and he felt the urge to vomit blood. 'It's not easy to be an assistant these days!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's late. He's drunk, so it's not convenient for me. You'd better take him back to Reed Residence where there are more servants and he can be taken good care of," said Grace as she proceeded to close the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Jason suddenly opened his eyes a little. When he saw Grace, a smile appeared on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This smile was so beautiful and bright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he suddenly raised his hand and grabbed Grace's waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Grace let out a low cry, and the next moment, most of his weight was on her.</p></div>
