        <h1>Chapter 3141</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She quickly withdrew her hand, as if feeling guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" He looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's...nothing." She said with a guilty conscience, feeling embarrassed to admit that she had been playing with his eyelashes while he was asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, her nervous laughter and guilty appearance only made him more suspicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was sweating profusely and could only say helplessly, "Well...I just played with your eyelashes while you were asleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised an eyebrow slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She quickly added, "I really just played around a little bit, just touched and gestured with my hands, measured the length, and didn't do anything else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He chuckled, finding her eager explanation quite adorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It doesn't matter even if you did something," he said as he lifted his hand and embraced her, pulling her into his arms. "Valda, everything I have is yours. Whatever you want to do to me is okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face suddenly turned red. His words were too easy to be misunderstood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's time to wake up. If you don't get up now, you'll be late for work!" she said, blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay even if I'm late, no one dares to deduct my salary," he said, burying his face in her neck, smelling her scent, feeling her warmth, reluctant to get up like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, he thought that the idea of "henceforth the king will not attend morning court" was absurd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he has a deeper understanding. If she were his partner, he wouldn't want to go to work early every day. Instead, he would want to stay in bed with her for a longer time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, say you love me," Brian's gentle and longing voice came from her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda paused for a moment, then smiled and said, "I love you, Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Say it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I love you, I love you, I love you..." she repeated over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Love him, without a doubt. After experiencing so much, it only made her think more clearly about her love for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked up and fixed his gaze on the person in front of him. "Valda, you are the person I will love and never let go for the rest of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As his voice trailed off, he kissed her lips... Everything was so sweet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy has been banned, and all of her endorsements, programs, and contracts have been terminated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This matter has caused a lot of discussion online. After all, Tracy was previously known for her wealthy and beautiful image. Suddenly, all of her work has come to a halt and her entertainment career has been banned, which naturally leads to various speculations from others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on with Tracy? Has she really been banned?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't her family pretty wealthy? She got all those resources through her family! Who could ban her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are rumors that it was the prince who ordered the ban."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why would the prince ban Tracy? They didn't have any relationship before! Or did Tracy do something to anger the prince?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People kept speculating, even Camille called her friend to ask, "Did your husband really ban Tracy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe," Valda hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just heard about this gossip today and haven't asked him yet. But Tracy and I have some grievances." Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What grievances?" Camille's gossip heart was ignited again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Valda briefly told Camille about the incident at the film festival where Tracy and her friends had caused trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After listening, Camille gritted her teeth and said, "Brian did the right thing by banning Tracy. People like her should be banned, otherwise they'll keep causing trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was amused by her friend's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By doing this, Brian has put my mind at ease. He is truly protecting you well," Camille said. "Now that Tracy has been banned, those who want to make things difficult for you will see it as a warning. If they ever want to cause trouble for you again, they will think twice."</p></div>
