        <h1>Chapter 856</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I really like you. I... I know I'm useless. I can't provide you a lavish lifestyle, but I can accompany you every day. I can do everything I can to protect you. If you've never tried, how do you know you can't develop feelings for me no matter how long it takes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was stuttering. He was so anxious yet so earnest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's nose felt a little sore. It turned out that there was someone who liked her so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not for any other reason. He just respected her no matter how destitute she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not push him away. His hug felt very, very warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because of this warmth that she hoped that one day he could meet a woman who really loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chase Harper, thank you for liking me, but even now when you're holding me, I feel nothing for you. Do you think it's necessary to try?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her ears came the sound of his silent breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A black car was parked not far away. The man inside looked at the pair embracing each other in the car ahead while his hands on his lap tightened...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The night was dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was already asleep in her bed in the quiet room, but the light by her bedside was on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ever since moving out of Reed Residence, she began turning on the light when she slept at night again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The soft light fell on her face, making her sleeping face seem serene and gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the door of the rented house was gently pushed open. A figure entered the house and closed the door behind them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The light fell on their body, reflecting the gloom on their face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked to the bedside step by step, looking at Grace who lay fast asleep on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene he witnessed today repeated before his eyes again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He met the man Chase Harper when she was still working at the Sanitation Service Center. Unexpectedly, she was with that man again now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She&hellip; even let the man hold her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know that when I saw that, I kept asking myself why she didn't push him away? Why?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she... attracted to that man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is that why she's willing to let that man hold her like that? Would she... date that man someday? Would she let the man kiss her? Would she&hellip; marry that man and have children with him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the thought of these possibilities, an acrid feeling spread across his chest, accompanied by a feeling that left him breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this the man you're going to use to forget me?" the cold voice murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the sleeping woman made no answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared down at the sleeping Grace. After a long while, he bent over to her cheek as if he wanted to get a closer look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't like other men, okay?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the one who had kicked her away. He was the one who wanted to break up with her, and he was the one who wanted to stop loving her. However, he could not accept it when he saw her being so intimate with other men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was conflicted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, she was still in a deep slumber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His line of sight moved from her eyes to her nose bridge, lips... Almost uncontrollably, he moved closer and closer to her, trying to take in her scent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um..." Her pink and tender lips unconsciously opened, muttering something in her sleep. It was like a fuse that made Jason tremble suddenly.</p></div>
