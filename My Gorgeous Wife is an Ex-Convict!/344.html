        <h1>Chapter 343</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if the pain gets worse if you don't take your medicine?" asked Grace. Suddenly, as if she had thought of something, Grace pulled out her phone and browsed the online pharmacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the pharmacy was a little far, it was all right if she paid enough service fees. Besides, the medicine would arrive in 20 minutes. That way, it was faster than waiting for the security to buy the medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought for a moment and decided to place the order through her phone. She ordered the same medicine she had bought for Jason last time. After placing the order successfully, her eyes once again fell on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was already curled up into a ball. His lips were pressed together as if to muffle the murmur that was about to burst from his mouth, but it made his breath sound a little more subdued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were now closed. His long fan-like lashes cast a shadow beneath his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man who ruled Emerald City looked like a vulnerable and helpless child right now. It was as if he had to stop the pain on his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace somehow felt a pang in her heart. He was the last person she should take pity on, but right now, she could not control this heartache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked around. The room looked just like a mourning hall. It just lacked a dead body and coffin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On a desk right ahead was the same photo that was hung on the wall of the hall. In front of the photo was a spirit tablet, on which &lsquo;In loving memory of Kim Reed&rsquo; was written.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was Jason's father called Kim Reed? He was just like his name. His name made him feel like some kind of gentleman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Next to it was the photo of a woman. The woman in the photo was very beautiful with a pretty face and long black wavy hair. She had gorgeous amorous eyes&mdash;they were exceedingly fascinating and charming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found that the woman's eyes looked a lot like Jason's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was this woman&hellip; his mother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a great deal of doubt in her mind now, but the pressing task was to find something to relieve his stomachache!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her eyes lit up when she saw the water dispenser in the room. She walked up to it, filled a glass of warm water, and walked over to Jason. "Here, drink some water. Perhaps you'll feel a little better after drinking some warm water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes quivered a little, and he slowly opened his eyes to stare at her. "Do you wish I&rsquo;ll hurt less, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kept her mouth shut and helped him up. She held the glass to his lips. He drank it mouthful by mouthful, though it was not long before he finished the whole glass of warm water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason slowly closed his eyes after he finished drinking. "But... I wish I can hurt more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him in confusion. Then, she heard him mutter, "I'm afraid my pain is much less than what you had suffered. Will you feel better if I hurt a little? If so, will you hate me less?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked surprised. She never thought Jason would say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he... sorry for what had happened to her... in prison?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her phone rang. It was a call from the deliveryman with the medicine.</p></div>
