        <h1>Chapter 1477</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As he spoke, he walked over to Grace and stared at her. "You once said you&rsquo;ll not abandon me as long as I don&rsquo;t leave you, didn't you? So whatever happens, you're not going to leave me as long as you live, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. What she said back then was still ringing in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her hands touched her belly, which was already as big as a full-term pregnant woman's. She took a deep breath before saying, "Yes, I did say so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, she turned to Brian and said, "Brian, you heard him. I... won't leave Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she uttered the word &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;, Jason's eyes suddenly sparkled as he stood next to her. An unstoppable flash of excitement flashed across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She&rsquo;s calling me &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; again. Does that mean she's willing to forgive me and let go of the past?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian's expression changed slightly, but there was not much surprise. Perhaps it was what he was expecting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He... just wanted to know if she would stay with Jason after learning the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, got it. If... this is what you want," Brian said and left the consulting room with his men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason also let the others leave the consulting room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, only Grace and Jason were left in the rather spacious consulting room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at Grace with shining eyes, appearing expectant and hopeful. "Grace, are you sure you won't leave me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I..." She was stunned. At this moment, even she was unsure if she would not leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had kept finding excuses for him these days. She told herself that he did not know her back then, so of course, he did not have any sympathy or pity for her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, even so, she still did not know how to face him. The sight of him brought back the memories of what had happened in prison. She would recall how Lily had pulled out her fingernails and how she was beaten until her uterus ruptured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There were even bouts of throbbing pain in her body. It was as if the pain from that time still lingered in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her silence dimmed the light in his eyes, and he suddenly smiled with self-mockery. "You only deliberately said that to Brian, didn't you? Were you afraid he'd continue to have feelings for you and waste his time, so you said that to him on purpose?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace nibbled her lip. That was exactly her intention when she said those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's face turned grim little by little. "Do you regret it? Do you regret marrying me? If Brian had paid two million dollars to save Lina, would you have..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stopped speaking. His dark peach blossom eyes stared at her. His delicate features and handsome face tugged at Grace's heart. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was about to speak, but he suddenly snapped, "Never mind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before she could react, he hastily opened the consulting room door and ran out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was instantly alone in the consulting room.</p></div>
