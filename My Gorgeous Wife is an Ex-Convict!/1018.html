        <h1>Chapter 1017</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He put her hands under the tap and took the soap to wash her hands with. He washed her hands over and over again as if to rinse off all the traces, smell, and temperature Brian had left on her hands...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace tried to withdraw her hands from Jason's grasp but it was to no avail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea how many times he had washed her hands. They began to ache. "Jason, stop it. What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned off the tap, picked up the towel nearby, and dried her hands carefully. "Don't let Brian touch your hands again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not bear the thought of what he had seen earlier. His body seemed to have been filled with jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that she would fall in love with Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop saying things that will irritate me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned for a moment before laughing. "Should I still be in love with you even after we&rsquo;ve broken up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stopped what he was doing and raised his eyes to meet her calm, almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no panic in those eyes he knew so well but an unperturbed calm instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the calmer she was, the more uneasy he felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her lips parted slowly, and her gentle breeze-like voice was as calm as her eyes. "Jason, since we&rsquo;ve broken up, I won't fall for you, love you, nor do anything for you. If they irritate you, then it's probably hard for me to keep you from getting angry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips tightened into a line while his eyes remained fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She continued, "If you want to continue this brother and sister game, so be it. However, I won't have any feelings for you anymore, and one day, I will truly forget about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart immediately sank. 'Truly... forget about me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just hearing her words made his heart feel as if it had exploded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could she have no feelings for me? How could she forget me? How could she do it so easily while I... can't!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his head and kissed Grace forcefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only this time, she did not struggle as before. She let him kiss her, and... gave him no response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she was silently telling him that she had no feelings for him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only a matter of time until she truly forgot about him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kissed her, but it felt like he was kissing an empty shell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was over, his heart grew more restless than ever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must have feelings for me! Don't forget me!" He pulled her hard into his arms as if that was the only way to ease his nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you think it's funny that you want me to have feelings for you and not to forget about you when we've broken up?" Grace scoffed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened. After a moment, he lowered his head slowly while his ink-like eyes stared at her. Then, as if he had made up his mind, he said, "What if... we never broke up?"</p></div>
