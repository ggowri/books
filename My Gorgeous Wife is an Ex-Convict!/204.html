        <h1>Chapter 203</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is that so,&rdquo; she said as she leaned forward. She somehow felt that his words were said on purpose for her to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His ink-black phoenix eyes stared at the face in front of him. Brian&rsquo;s thin lips parted slightly as he resumed saying, &ldquo;Because back then, I was separated from someone in that hospital. That person told me once that she really liked to eat at this restaurant, so I&rsquo;ll come to sit here and have their food every year on the day I was separated from her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;In that case, I think that person must be someone very important you, huh?&rdquo; said Grace. Hearing his tone, it seemed that he really missed that person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, very important. To me, her life is nearly as important as mine.&rdquo; His indifferent tone sounded as if he was saying something very natural.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was shocked when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was this concerned about a person he parted with? Originally, in her eyes, someone like him who constantly changed girlfriends, and was even so merciless to his ex-girlfriends, was immoveable in terms of feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought that once a ripple of water appeared in his heart, it would disappear and be like it never existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at this moment, he was saying that there was someone whose level of importance in his heart was nearly the same as his own life&rsquo;s. If the media were to hear this, she was not sure what thoughts they would have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Since she&rsquo;s so important, haven&rsquo;t you tried to find her?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gave a low chuckle. His gaze was still on her as if he was observing her reaction. &ldquo;I am looking for her. Of course, I am. Only it&rsquo;s a pity that back in those times, there were many places in this town that didn&rsquo;t have security cameras. Plus, I only started looking for her after some days passed, so I couldn&rsquo;t find her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tone carried an obvious regret. How many years had he been constantly searching for this person? As time passed, however, everything only got more and more muddled up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, he could not even help thinking that he would never find this person again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then I hope you can find this person soon,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, I hope I can find her soon too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What about you? When you were in this little town, did you have any special experiences? Such as&hellip; saving anyone, or telling someone that the food in this restaurant is really good.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace burst into laughter. &ldquo;I probably told a lot of people back then that this restaurant&rsquo;s food is pretty good, but actually the locals all like to eat here. As for saving someone&hellip; I probably haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least, she could not remember doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You really haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; His eyes narrowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Hart, are you hoping that I&rsquo;ve saved someone?&rdquo; Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Despair flashed through Brian&rsquo;s eyes. So&hellip; it was not her? The person he was looking for was not her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, he had not thought too much of it in the beginning. It was just that when he saw her for the first time, he felt that her face vaguely had the image of the person from his memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only back then, that person had been much younger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later on, according to that person&rsquo;s appearance from his memories, he imagined many times what she would look like as a grown-up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In these few years, all the girlfriends he found had appearances that were more or less similar to that person&rsquo;s image.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, after he saw her in the hospital, a suspicion rose in him suddenly. He thought, &lsquo;Is this woman before me possibly that person?&rsquo;</p></div>
