        <h1>Chapter 537</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, what about the woman with Young Master Reed?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This situation was also likely to trigger gossip. Grace looked at the ambiguous glances on her and Nelson. She suddenly understood what others were thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um... There seems to be a misunderstanding," Grace whispered to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled. "Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?" His voice sounded a little playful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Um... Could he not see the way these people were looking at them? Grace blinked and stared at Jason, but those bright, amorous eyes were clear right now. It was so clear that he even... Looked innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only grit her teeth and blush slightly, saying, "They think that Nelson is our child!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let them think that way," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Huh? Grace was stunned. Just let them think that way? Was this... Appropriate? "But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are no buts," he said. "We're going to have children sooner or later. Is there any difference between them thinking we have a child a few years early and a few years later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Well, she had nothing to refute his remarks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, let&rsquo;s get over there," said Jason before taking Nelson by the other hand and walking on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This move reinforced the speculations about the relationship between the three. A man and a woman holding a child's hand like that were obviously a family of three!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not announce to the public that he was married and had a three or four-year-old child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it a secret marriage? Or was she just a lover? Was this child born out of wedlock? Suddenly, there were a lot of sympathetic looks at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were more envious eyes than anything else. After all, a child could improve their mother's status. As long as she gave birth to his child, she would have a bright future! Even if she could not be the Reed family's lady of the house, at least she could live a rich life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director of the film knew Jason, though he was surprised when Jason's secretary approached him to ask for an invitation to the premiere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that he saw Jason here with a woman and a child, even the director, who had gone through hell and back, was seriously taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Welcome, Young Master Reed," greeted the director as he stepped forward enthusiastically. "These two are..." He glanced at Grace and Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is my girlfriend Grace and the other one is Nelson," answered Jason. He just introduced Nelson's name, but not his identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that way, it confirmed to some onlookers that the little one was Jason's illegitimate child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, illegitimate children could not be introduced above board.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Director Stevens, you made a nice casting this time. My girlfriend likes Howell Webb. Can my girlfriend meet Howell Webb after the premiere? She'd love to have a photo taken with him and get an autograph or something," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Director Stevens was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She liked Howell Webb? She wanted a photo and an autograph? Why did this&hellip; Sound like a groupie? Why did he feel that Jason's presence at the premiere of his movie today was only because he was trying to help his girlfriend fangirl over her favorite celebrity?!</p></div>
