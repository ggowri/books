        <h1>Chapter 2017</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You&rsquo;re thanking me?" Philip Barlow chuckled and stared at Jasper Reed. 'She must be the one who&rsquo;s making my son reluctant to leave the Reed family.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't need you to thank me." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the man in front of her, Jasper found him a little familiar, but she had no idea it was because William looked somewhat similar to Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow looked at William. "I hope the next time you come looking for me will be the time you're willing to leave the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper was shocked as soon as he said that. She immediately pulled William behind her like a hen protecting her chick. However, she was only five years old and was as tall as William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William wouldn't want to leave my family! Who are you, Uncle?" Her sixth sense gave her a feeling that the uncle in front of her would steal William away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm..." Philip Barlow was just about to speak when William suddenly exclaimed, "I'm not leaving!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow stared at William. Moments later, he asked slowly, "Really?" It was as if he was mocking him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Without saying anything else, Philip Barlow turned to leave. Jasper hugged and kissed William. "I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t leave, William!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Mick Reed, who had been quietly staring at Philip Barlow's leaving figure, seemed to be thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the evening, Jasper came to William's room with her small pillow and blanket to sleep in his bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The Reed family was used to Jasper sleeping with William every night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, why did that uncle say that he wanted you to leave the Reed family the next time you look for him? Who's that uncle? Do you know him?" asked Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though the man had left, uneasiness continued to envelop her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I..." William clenched his teeth and looked at the pair of clear eyes in front of him. His words were on the tip of his tongue, but what he said was, "No, I don't know him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not want her to know that he had a father. He could not stay with the Reed family anymore if everyone found out that he had a father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I don't know why he said that either. I'm not leaving. Jasper, didn't you say we're friends and I have to stay here forever?" William's voice stammered a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah." Jasper had a bright smile on her face. "We're friends. William, you can just stay here forever! I'll be nice to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her smile warmed his heart, but he felt guilty about lying to her at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wanted to stay here. He wanted to stay here no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The birthday party for the Reed family's triplets had become the talk of Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Many people only knew about Little Young Master Mick but did not know that there were triplets. The birthday party would be the triplets&rsquo; first public appearance. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the Reed family was very protective of the triplets. The press was stopped at the hotel where the party was being held. All the reporters knew that they would have to blur the triplets' faces in all photos or videos of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If they exposed the triplets' faces to the public, they might not be able to make a living in Emerald City anymore. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
