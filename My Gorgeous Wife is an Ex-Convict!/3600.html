        <h1>Chapter 3598</h1>
        <div><p>At the moment, he was bowing his head, his fingers moving quickly on the keys, as if he was completely immersed in this music and hadn&#x27;t noticed Jasper&#x27;s arrival.</p><p>At first, Jasper thought William was simply playing the piano, but later she realized that he was constantly repeating the same piece, and even...if you looked closely, you could see a pained expression on his face.</p><p>&quot;Enough!&quot; Jasper stepped forward and pressed his fingers on the piano keys, stopping him from playing further.</p><p>William seemed to snap out of it and looked at Jasper, somewhat breathless as he asked, &quot;You...what are you doing here?&quot; He seemed to be struggling to control his emotions.</p><p>&quot;I couldn&#x27;t sleep, so I came to find you and saw you playing the piano,&quot; she said, taking his hand and noticing that his fingertips were slightly red.</p><p>He must have been playing for a long time!</p><p>&quot;What&#x27;s wrong? Did something happen? You rarely play this kind of music, and you keep repeating it,&quot; Jasper asked.</p><p>William&#x27;s eyes flickered, and he withdrew his hand from hers with some unease. &quot;Nothing happened, I...I just played randomly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;re lying!&quot; she said.</p><p>He was startled, and his hands involuntarily clenched into fists as he nervously looked at her.</p><p>Did she...notice something?</p></div>
