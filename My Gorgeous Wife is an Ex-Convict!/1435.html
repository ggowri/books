        <h1>Chapter 1434</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In a daze, Martin Weiss sat in the car as he watched Kyla Corbyn pick up their son in the kindergarten. The mother and son walked hand in hand to the nearby bus station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had a chance to walk with them, but he ruined it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were right in front of him, but he could not get anywhere near them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He thought he was successful because he had revived the Weiss family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he was the biggest failure of all. The only person he loved did not even want to see him after she died!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His son could have been a healthy child but lost his hearing because of his revenge!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everything from the past brought him pain now that he thought of it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had no idea when the pain would stop!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe... it would continue to be so painful until the day he died!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss raised his hand and pressed his palm against his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With every beat, he was in terrible pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At night, in the Reed family's mansion, Jason helped Grace back to the bed with great care after soaking her feet and applying her hands with the traditional medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help laughing at his cautiousness. "You don't need to be so careful. I'm not at the point where I can't walk yet. Besides, the three little ones are pretty obedient."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Aside from the time she had serious morning sickness at the beginning, she had basically stopped vomiting and been sleeping well since being five months along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The hospital test results showed that everything was going in the right direction. She began to feel relieved as the babies in her belly were safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason seemed to be preparing for war. As her belly grew larger, he became more like a tense string.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Several times when she woke up in the middle of the night for toilet runs, she would find him awake, looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why are you still up? Why are you looking at me like that?" When she asked him, he would say, "I seem to feel more at ease looking at you like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is he not reassured enough? Is he afraid that something might happen when I give birth?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Perhaps he'll be at ease once the babies are born!' Grace thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hurry and rest. You haven't had a good rest these days because of Kyla Corbyn," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, there was suddenly a knock on the bedroom door. Jason frowned slightly and shouted, "Come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The butler opened the door, walked into the bedroom, and said, "Young Master, Young Madam, a man named Martin Weiss got drunk and has been shouting outside the mansion, asking to see Young Madam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The butler glanced at Grace out of the corners of his eyes as he spoke. Then, he asked cautiously, "Should we call the police?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Reed family was finally having some peace. Young Master and Young Madam had just gotten married. The three heirs in Young Madam's belly were not even born yet. The butler did not want a strange man to cause trouble for the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'After all, Young Master is very concerned about Young Madam!'</p></div>
