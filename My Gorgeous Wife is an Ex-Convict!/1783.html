        <h1>Chapter 1781</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had never been one to hesitate, but she was now hesitating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Lina saw the data on her blood test report an hour later, her heart instantly sank. She had looked it up on Stephensondu before and knew that this data meant... she was pregnant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She... was indeed pregnant! She was pregnant with Hadwin Stephenson's baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina went to the consulting room with a blank expression and gave the report to the doctor. After some questioning, Lina learned that she was probably four weeks pregnant now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're in the first trimester now. Come back every other day for a blood test. If your hCG levels are doubling, then you're fine," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was dumbfounded. "What if they don&rsquo;t double?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then you may need to take injections or drugs to save the baby, depending on the situation," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For a moment, Lina did not know whether she wanted her hCG levels to double or not. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Lina got her blood test report again two days later, the doctor said to her with a smile, "Your hCG levels have doubled. The baby is doing well in your belly..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina suddenly felt relieved when she heard the doctor say this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was then she realized that she subconsciously wanted the child to be okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After coming out of the hospital, Lina unknowingly drove to Stephenson Group's office building in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she came to her senses, she realized that another car was in front of her. The car was trying to leave, but she was parked right next to the exit of the underground parking lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina hurried to back up the car, but she accidentally caught a glimpse of the figure sitting in the back seat. Her hands instantly trembled, and instead of backing up, her car grazed the other party&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Luckily, she slammed on the brakes in time, or she might have crashed into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina broke out in a cold sweat. Her hand rested almost automatically on her belly as if to... protect the baby inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She realized her own actions and was somewhat astonished. 'Is it because&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to the baby? Do I want the baby to live?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the driver got out and walked up to Lina's car, knocking on the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina hurriedly opened the door. After a glance, she recognized the driver. The other day when Hadwin Stephenson pulled her into the car after she was surrounded by reporters, the one driving seemed to be this driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Sweeney, your car grazed Mr. Stephenson's car," the driver respectfully said to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ah, yes... Well... why don't we get the traffic police to come? I'll take full responsibility for the accident," Lina said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Sweeney, if you want to take full responsibility, you need to compensate for the damage. I wonder if your insurance is enough to pay for the car's damages?" the driver said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Is it... expensive?" asked Lina. Although Hadwin Stephenson's cars were expensive luxury cars, her car insurance went up to 500,000 dollars. It was probably enough to pay for a scratch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What the driver said next almost made Lina faint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What the driver said was... "Miss Sweeney, we haven't assessed the car's damages, but it's probably going to cost more than one million dollars. Miss Sweeney, is your insured amount enough to pay for it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"One million dollars?" Lina almost fainted. "Is Hadwin Stephenson's car made from diamonds? One million dollars for a scratch?" Besides, it was just a minor scratch.</p></div>
