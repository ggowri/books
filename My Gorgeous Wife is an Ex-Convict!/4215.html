        <h1>Chapter 4213</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt like she had just had a very long dream, but she couldn't remember what she had experienced in the dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she slowly opened her eyes, she saw unfamiliar faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't recognize any of these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But every person, upon seeing her wake up, had a face full of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's awake, she's awake, she's finally awake!" Lina said tearfully, filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought she would lose her daughter, but thank God, her daughter was alive and back by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great, call the doctor!" Hadwin quickly added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse who had been accompanying them in the ward had already left quickly to call the doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chandler approached the bedside and looked at Tina, who had just woken up. "Tina, you finally woke up. We've been by your bedside for three days. Do you know how much we missed you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina blinked and looked at the unfamiliar faces in front of her. These were faces she had never seen before, but they gave her a strange sense of familiarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she had felt this same familiarity with Kit before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have we met before?" Tina asked hoarsely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's parents and Chandler glanced at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Lina and Hadwin had already heard from Chandler about their daughter's memory loss, when their daughter actually asked such a question, they couldn't help but feel a deep sense of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that their daughter had just woken up, they were afraid of upsetting her, so Lina could only say tearfully, "Yes, we have met before... You don't need to think about anything now, just focus on recovering here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Kit?" Tina looked around the ward, but there was no sign of Kit. She asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this question made the people in the ward's expressions more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Hadwin spoke up, "He also got injured and is still undergoing treatment, so he couldn't come to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is he? Is he seriously injured?" Tina struggled to sit up, but Lina quickly held her down. "Don't get up yet, you still have injuries, it's not advisable to get up right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's okay, the injuries are not serious, just some fractures in certain places. It will take some time to heal," Hadwin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, she suddenly realized something and reached for her abdomen, then asked nervously, "What about the baby? My baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The baby is fine because it was born prematurely, it's in the incubator," Lina quickly reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Tina stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, really. Why would I lie to you? Once you're feeling a bit better, I'll take you to </span><span>see the baby," Lina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the woman in front of her, with tears in her eyes, and felt an inexplicable fondness and trust toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if a subconscious voice was telling her that she could trust the woman in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina nodded, and just then, the doctor came to perform some routine checks on Tina.</span></p></div>
