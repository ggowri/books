        <h1>Chapter 2372</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They put on this show just to mislead the two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, many preparations had to be made, lest they blew it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Few people could make these preparations in Emerald City. Jason could pull it off, but it did not mean it could be easily done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said with a smile, "It's just because my wife doesn't want them to get away with it. You might as well sit down and watch. The result should be out soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss and Kyla sat aside, and sure enough, the judge soon pronounced their sentences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert was sentenced to life imprisonment, while Jacqueline Bowman was let go on a three-year probation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the judge pronounced the sentence, Jacqueline Bowman's face showed a slight smile of satisfaction. Meanwhile, Mr. Lambert's face was full of disbelief. "How is this possible? It was all this bitch's idea! She's the mastermind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert kept shouting, but no one paid any attention to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Grace entered the room and said to Kyla, "I'll arrange for Jacqueline Bowman to meet you, and you can ask her Amber Mitchell's whereabouts in person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Grace!" Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mention it. She&rsquo;ll return to the detention center after telling us about Amber Mitchell's whereabouts. People like her should be punished by the law," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half an hour later, Kyla met Jacqueline Bowman at the detention center's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was at Kyla's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, you're out. Can you tell us Amber Mitchell's whereabouts now?" Kyla looked at her and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman chuckled. "Of course, I'll tell you. But I need 30 million U.S. dollars transferred to my foreign account. Then, put me on a plane out of the country. I'll tell you Amber Mitchell's whereabouts once I'm safely abroad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's expression froze. "I don't have 30 million!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have it, but your friends do. Why don't you borrow it from your best friend?" Jacqueline Bowman said pointedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's expression froze. "30 million U.S. dollars isn't a problem, but how can we believe that you&rsquo;ll tell us Amber Mitchell's whereabouts after you go abroad? After all, we can't catch you if you decide not to tell me, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman said, "But if you really want Amber Mitchell's whereabouts, you can only do as I say, can't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. "Not necessarily. We can just search all over the country for her. It's just that the process will be slightly troublesome, but that doesn't mean you can threaten us! Jacqueline Bowman, don't go too far. You think you've got something, but you might end up getting nothing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Grace turned to Kyla and said, "Kyla, let's go. She might not even know where Amber Mitchell is since she's pulling so many tricks. Even if she gets out of prison now, with no money and an ill reputation, she's only going to be miserable. Maybe she'll be worse off than Amber Mitchell after a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said nothing and followed Grace into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman got a little panicked when the two ignored her. She was now in this situation and had also offended the Weiss family. Even though she had been given probation, there was no saying that the Weiss family would not secretly do something to her!</p></div>
