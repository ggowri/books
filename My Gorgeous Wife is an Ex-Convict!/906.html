        <h1>Chapter 905</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn felt bitter once she talked about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to Paisley Daniels, what happened to her daughter was too tragic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, stop!" Kyla said quickly. After all, her son was right beside them and she did not want him to hear about the grown-ups' grudges.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn seemed to come to herself and shut her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Nelson was focused on his surroundings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With each passing day, Kyla felt her uneasiness growing stronger and stronger. She could not wait for the three of them to get into the high-speed train.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, an announcement that they needed to check-in began to play through the broadcast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Nelson wanted to go to the washroom, so Kyla turned to Mrs. Corbyn and said, "Mom, look after our luggage. I'll take Nelson to the washroom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You gotta hurry. They're checking us in now," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I got it," replied Kyla as she took her son by the hand and went to the washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took her son to the women's washroom because he was too young to go to the men's washroom alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Luckily, there were doors in every cubicle in the women's washroom which was relatively private, and no one usually had a problem with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the little one finished his business, Kyla picked him up by the sink so that he could wash his hands before she led him out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, are you scared?" his childish voice suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked down at her son in surprise. "Nelson, why do you think so?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because the way you look now is just like when Ben is afraid of the monster," said the little one. Ben 10 was the latest cartoon he had watched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was stunned. 'Not only my mom but even my son can sense my fear? Am I being that obvious?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll protect Mommy! Don't be afraid, Mommy," Nelson said earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes reddened. She could not help squatting down to hug her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I won't be afraid," muttered Kyla. Giving birth to Nelson was probably the best choice she had made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would take good care of her son. She would keep Nelson from any harm, even if she had to sacrifice everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not come to herself until she heard another announcement over the broadcast about the check-in process. She quickly took Nelson out of the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only walked a few steps when she suddenly came to a halt. Her body trembled uncontrollably while all the colors faded from her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No way! How could Martin Weiss be here?' A sudden fear gripped Kyla, making her want to run away immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... her feet seemed to be stuck in place, unable to move a step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, it's the man I saw last time. He helped me recover my hearing aid," said Nelson while his little hand broke free from Kyla's. He ran to Martin Weiss who was staring at him intently. He said politely, &ldquo;Hello, Uncle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Few things could surprise Martin Weiss, but today, he was surprised again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he heard that she had a three or four-year-old child with her on the phone, he was so shocked that he forgot about everything and ran out. When he came back to his senses, he was already driving his car from S City to Emerald City.</p></div>
