        <h1>Chapter 2745</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked. "Do I need to apply ointment for this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Do you have any ointment for blood stasis and pain relief?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I do, but you don't need medicine for such injuries&mdash;" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He interrupted her before she could finish her sentence. "Where is it?" he asked, staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could only take out the ointment obediently. Brian opened the ointment cap and applied it for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he smeared the ointment on the red marks on her wrist with his fingertips, Valda Theller felt a strange sensation spreading through her body. Her heartbeat quickened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's wrong with me? All he&rsquo;s doing is applying ointment for me. Why did my heartbeat quicken?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I mustn't and can't fall for this man! There's no way it's gonna work out between us. He loves another woman.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller tried hard to warn herself not to care about Brian. When he finally finished applying the ointment, she quickly withdrew her hand. "Have a seat while I prepare dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not wait to leave, but Brian stopped her. "You can't make dinner when you've just applied ointment on your hand. Let me do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller widened her eyes in surprise. 'I didn't hear it wrong, did I? He wants to... make dinner?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Valda Theller saw Brian take off his jacket, roll up his shirt sleeves, and walk into the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His long fingers opened the plastic bag containing vegetables she had bought from the supermarket. He took the vegetables out one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He washed the vegetables, cut them, then cooked them... Valda Theller found that Brian was indeed cooking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once the food was ready, Valda Theller spoke with slight embarrassment, "I'm sorry for troubling you today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think it's too much trouble," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lowered her head and began digging in. For some reason, she felt awkward facing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe what had happened in the hospital today made her understand her position more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes glimmered as he watched Valda Theller's face almost glued to the bowl. He could feel her estrangement from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He caused all this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said everyone could tell that he did not love her. Jason and Kyla could tell that. Was he going to let Grace realize that too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian felt a sudden pain in his heart as he recalled Grace's pale and weak appearance in the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want Grace to have any mood swings again. He could not let Grace learn he had no feelings for Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you be a real couple with me?" His hoarse voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly stopped eating and looked up blankly at the person in front of her. "What... do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian murmured, "Ad I said, let's become a real couple. We'll stop acting and date seriously."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked. "Why are you... suddenly saying that?" She could not understand why he would suddenly want to turn a fake relationship into a real one. "You don't love me, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said he wanted them to be a real couple, but there was no affection in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want Grace to know we're fake. She can't afford to have any mood swings right now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It suddenly dawned on her. Her eyelashes quivered slightly as she looked down slowly. It turned out that he made such a sudden decision because of Grace.</p></div>
