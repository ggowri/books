        <h1>Chapter 701</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only after hearing that he liked purple that she seemed to have changed her mind about the purple gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is&hellip; She trying to distance herself from me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought flashed through Brian's mind, but it made him feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each of the fitting rooms here was separate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian and Stella Lindsay were led by the staff to one of the VIP dressing rooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Stella Lindsay appeared in front of Brian wearing the same gown that Grace had just worn, Brian only glanced at her and said, "Not bad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay also knew that she would not look as good in this gown as Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially when she wore it after Grace had worn it. It just seemed like a crude imitation, but she could not even get another gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, do you think I shouldn't have fought with Grace over a gown?" Stella Lindsay looked aggrieved. "I... I just wanted to wear a purple dress and make you happy because I remember you telling me when you were little that you like the color purple."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Stella Lindsay continued saying, "My marriage didn&rsquo;t go well all these years. I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about our childhood, thinking about how you said you would come to find me, thinking that maybe there was someone out there who could save me from that upsetting marriage... And here you are!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay became more and more agitated as she spoke, reaching out to grab Brian's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked down at the person in front of him and gently pulled his arm away. "Stella, I'm nice to you because you saved my life, so if you need anything or want anything, I'll do it for you if I can&hellip; But that's all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's body stiffened, and her face paled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Is he implying that I shouldn&rsquo;t be too greedy and go after something I can't get?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why? Just because I&rsquo;ve always stayed in a small town? Because I only have a high school degree? Or is it because I was married?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I won&rsquo;t accept this. How can I? I&rsquo;ve finally managed to get near him and live a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it&rsquo;s only because I saved his life when he was little, how long will this good time last if I don&rsquo;t end up marrying him? If he marries and has children in the future, would she tolerate me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I must fight for it. Only in this way can I get what I want!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason then helped Grace pick out a silver gown. When Grace put it on, she could not help being impressed with his taste. The gown was completely different from the purple gown earlier. It was less demure but more playful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I feel like I'm a few years younger," said Grace as she looked at herself in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You say that like you're old. You look very young to me," said Jason as he stood behind Grace and looked at her in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, you're younger than I am." Although they were the same age, she was born in July, and he was born in November. She was several months older than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So? Shall I call you &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;?" Jason asked with a chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Sis&rsquo; was a nickname she had not heard for a long time, and it could not help but remind Grace that if she had known he was Jason, she would not have let him call her that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, their relationship might not have developed to the stage they were currently at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once, she thought of him as a brother, but now... A blush could not help spreading across her face. Dressed in the silver gown, it made her look particularly attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few strands of hair fell from her cheeks. Grace lowered her head slightly, naturally raising her hand to tuck her hair behind her ear. She was unaware that when she lowered her head and raised her hand, it was like there was an invisible hand tugging gently at his heartstrings.</p></div>
