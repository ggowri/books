        <h1>Chapter 1522</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That face... It looks just like the face that I&rsquo;ve seen on the marriage certificate&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And what did this little girl just call me? Daddy?!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that split second, the father and daughter were just staring at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, it was not just Jason who was stunned but even Terrence who was beside him was also glancing at the little girl who was hugging his boss. 'Gosh, she&hellip; really looks like a mini version of Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;But upon a closer look, she looks a little like Young master Reed as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Could it be that this little girl is&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was at that moment the little girl suddenly furrowed both her little brows. She turned around and looked in the direction of Grace. "Mommy, didn't you say that daddy will like me? Why isn't he hugging me? Did Daddy really love you so much? And he even cried for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That little girl started to suspect the words her mother had previously told her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The people in the surroundings were drenched in sweat. Yet, Grace did not answer her daughter. Her gaze was currently on Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though she could not recall the reason why she had left Jason and why she was &lsquo;dead&rsquo; in Emerald City, she remembered how they had been in love and how they ended up getting married. She had promised him that she would give him a complete family and never leave his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Tears welled up in Grace&rsquo;s eyes as she walked over to Jason, taking one step at a time. The scenes from their past were flashing in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She remembered the very first time she cooked him a bowl of noodles at the rented house when Jason came to live with her; the scene when she was sold off to a crazy person by her relatives and he rushed over in the middle of the night just to rescue her; the scene when she was pregnant with his children and he had said, "Let's get married."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had even said, "Never leave my side, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had promised him, yet she still left his side for five years. At this moment, she was finally in front of him. Each step she had taken to reach here was so difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm back, Jay," Grace said while choking. She raised her hand and gently touched Jason's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her hand touched his face that was a little cold. This had always been how his body temperature was. He was the man whom she loved most. He was also&hellip; the man who loved her the most in the entire world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In this entire world, no other people would love her as much as this man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason frowned. Subconsciously, he wanted to avoid her touch. After all, he was not used to having others make physical contact with him. Besides, the appearance of the woman in front of him made him suspicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Furthermore, when she called him 'Jay', he felt his body suddenly tense up. With that, he allowed her hand to touch his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'This is a&hellip; very gentle feeling.' It was accompanied by a feeling which he found very familiar. Even his body&hellip; seemed to be yearning for this feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As for the people around him, they were all looking at the scene playing out with astonished looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Young master Reed is actually allowing others to touch his face? Just what relationship does this woman share with Young master Reed?!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch's expression became extremely awful. 'What the hell is going on here? Why didn't Young master Reed push this woman away? He&rsquo;s even allowing this woman to keep touching his face?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'On any ordinary day, it'd be difficult for me to even try to get close to him.&rsquo; There was once where she intentionally wore very seducing sleepwear to seek an opportunity to get closer to Young master Reed. She had put on a seductive pose and wanted to seduce him.</p></div>
