        <h1>Chapter 4109</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Eugenia was surprised. "Do you really want to have a baby so early?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you think I was joking earlier?" Tina waved her hand, made a goodbye gesture, and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching her friend's back, Eugenia couldn't help but whisper, "What is Tina thinking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wants to have a baby now? She hasn't even graduated from college yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina originally planned to ask Veronica, after all, she was already a mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then she thought again, it seemed that Veronica and Mason's child was also accidentally conceived, so asking her wouldn't be of much reference value.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What she wants to know now is how to get pregnant as soon as possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Tina went directly to the hospital and made an appointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She originally planned to make an appointment with a regular gynecologist, but then she thought, what if she has a difficult pregnancy? So she made an appointment with the infertility department.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To be safe, she also made an appointment with a specialist, which cost 200 yuan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While waiting in the rest area, Tina was amazed by the number of people there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most of them were women, with a few accompanied by men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina finally found an empty seat and sat down to wait for her turn. A woman next to her struck up a conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Young lady, are you here for infertility treatment?" The woman was surprised to see someone as young as Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Tina replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't have to worry so much at your age. If you still haven't had a child in a few years, it's not too late to come back then," the woman said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina thought to herself, "Not too late? If I wait a few more years to have a child, it will be too late. I want to get pregnant tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Or maybe you want to have a child quickly to win a man's heart!" The woman looked Tina up and down. "You...are you unmarried and hoping to use a child to secure your future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that Tina didn't respond, the woman thought she had guessed correctly and continued, "If that's the case, you might end up regretting it. I have a friend from my hometown who did the same thing. She thought that if she had a child, the man would marry her out of obligation. She even secretly poked holes in the condoms to get pregnant. But in the end, even after she had the child, the man still didn't marry her. He married someone else instead..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman was trying to tell Tina that having a child doesn't guarantee marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Tina's attention was focused on the idea of poking holes in condoms!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why hadn't she thought of that before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Chandler really refused to let her get pregnant early, she could use this trick!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for now, the most important thing was to learn about getting pregnant as soon as possible from the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, it was Tina's turn. The doctor was surprised to see someone as young as 20 seeking infertility treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was rare for someone so young to seek infertility treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, in response to Tina's concerns, the doctor patiently answered her questions and ordered some tests for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After Tina completed the tests, it was confirmed that she was in good health and should be able to conceive quickly as long as she pays attention during the pregnancy period. Of course, this also requires cooperation from her partner and no issues with fertility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was actually quite relieved about Chandler's health condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If Chandler did have any health problems, then Hunter would have treated him already!</p></div>
