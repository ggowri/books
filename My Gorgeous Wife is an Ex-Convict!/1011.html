        <h1>Chapter 1010</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence dared not ask any more questions and started the car, driving slowly away from the area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason closed his eyes gently as if he was tired. The moment he saw her, his empty heart seemed to fill up little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she disappeared from his sight, his heart... seemed to feel empty again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She can still easily affect my mood. She can make me feel content or frustrated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it impossible for me to not love her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Terrence, do you think I'm still in love with Grace?" Jason's voice suddenly rang in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence stiffened, thinking it was a trick question!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Master Reed, you..." Terrence wondered what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me the truth!" Jason said coldly as if he had guessed his intention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Terrence could only go all out and say, "Master Reed, the way you look at Miss Cummins is the way men look at women. Otherwise, you wouldn't have gotten so angry after knowing that Young Master Hart is in love with Miss Cummins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Women had always been finding ways to cling to Master Reed, but these days, it was as if Master Reed was trying desperately to cling to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then was I just fooling myself by calling her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;?" Jason's voice once again rang in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Terrence dared not give a direct answer. He only said, "You're probably missing the time when you were mistaken for a homeless person by Miss Cummins, Master Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Missing?' Jason's eyes darkened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, I miss it. She trusted me with all her heart then, and for the first time, I felt familial warmth.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father had never given him this warmth before, neither did his mother and grandfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only she had given it to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gradually fell in love with her because of this! He loved her to the point where he could almost give her his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he was calling her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; again and trapped her by his side as siblings just to cover up the fact that he still loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no way he could erase his feelings for her from his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was just trying to deceive himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to court with Lawyer Carter for Baldwin's car accident compensation trial. In court, Elise Dean, who had refused to admit to being the perpetrator of the accident, suddenly went out of her way to admit to all the charges and even offered to compensate Baldwin's family and cover all of Baldwin's medical bills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surprised by the change, and she saw the shock in Lawyer Carter's eyes as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter did not know that Elise Dean would do that all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this was a satisfactory solution to the problem. There was nothing else to discuss in the case, so the court announced the sentence on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Elise Dean found someone to take her place when she was the perpetrator, other charges were waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Elise Dean left the court and passed by Grace, Grace could not help asking, "Why did you suddenly change your attitude so much that you were willing to plead guilty and offer compensation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not believe it if Elise Dean said she had suddenly succumbed to her conscience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" Elise Dean suddenly sneered and glared at Grace sarcastically. "You have the nerve to ask me why! If I had known you knew Brian, I wouldn't have done all this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only say that she was unfortunate!</p></div>
