        <h1>Chapter 3912</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is my private matter. Is there anything else, Mr. Reed?" Nancy turned around calmly and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick looked at the obvious slap mark on her face and felt a bit uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like every time I see you, you're being hit by your so-called sister. Does she hit you often?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not often," Nancy said. "If you have nothing else, then I'll take my leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I haven't said you can leave," Mick said. "Since you're a hotel employee, if I haven't allowed you to leave, then you can't leave, can you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy pursed her lips. Not only was she just a hotel employee, but even if she wasn't, how many people would dare to disobey the young master of the Reed family if he wanted to keep someone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wonder what Mr. Reed wants?" she asked respectfully. After all, she couldn't afford to offend the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come with me to the lounge," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The lounge was right next to the banquet hall. Nancy hesitated for a moment, but still followed Mick to the lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they were about to reach the lounge, they ran into some of the hotel staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When her colleagues saw her walking with Mick, they were clearly surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The hotel should have a first aid kit, right? I need some ointment for swelling and bruises. Have it sent to the lounge later," Mick instructed the hotel staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," the other person quickly responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's heart trembled. He wanted that ointment. If he hadn't been injured himself, could it be because... of the swelling on her face?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the two of them arrived at the lounge, the hotel staff soon brought the ointment over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, only Nancy and Mick were left in the lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come here," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy walked up to Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was about to open the ointment, but Nancy quickly said, "If... Mr. Reed wants to help me apply the ointment, I can do it myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick stopped moving and stared at her with deep, dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air around them seemed to freeze in an instant. Nancy felt an invisible pressure all over her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just by looking at her like this, Mick made her feel oppressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this... the pressure of someone in a higher position?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had seen all kinds of people in the hotel, including some high-ranking officials, and she had never felt this kind of pressure before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If... it's just me being presumptuous, then Mr. Reed can just treat it as a joke." Nancy tried to remain calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, Mick's voice sounded in the lounge, "You're not being presumptuous. I did intend to help you apply the medicine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Huh?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stared at him in a daze for a while before hoarsely saying, "Then I'll do it myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she reached out to take the ointment from Mick's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Mick didn't seem to want to give it to her. "What if I insist on helping you apply it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip and her eyelashes trembled slightly before slowly lowering her eyes. "Then I'll trouble Mr. Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked completely obedient and respectful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick raised an eyebrow slightly, seeming a little surprised by her obedience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He applied the ointment to her swollen cheek with his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was strange that he was giving medicine to someone outside of his family for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she was a stranger, he still did this kind of thing.</p></div>
