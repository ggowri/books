        <h1>Chapter 1917</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace watched Jason in pain. He even knocked his head against the cracked ground as if to distract himself from what was going on in his head. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, instead of tightening her hold on Jason&rsquo;s hand as he told her to, Grace loosened her grip. Her slender wrist slowly slid from his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, no!" Jason shouted frantically. Tears had covered his face at some point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His tears ran down his cheeks, dripping onto her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Drip! Drip!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was so warm it made her feel it was okay and she would not regret it even if she sacrificed everything for this man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because no one in the world loved her the way he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the same way... "Jay, I'm sorry... I hurt you, but I&rsquo;m also the woman who loves you most... Stay alive. Live... a good life..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She loved him so much that she would make the same choice if she had to do it again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When there was another explosion, Grace closed her eyes and smiled. She hoped the last thing she would leave Jay was her smile, and she also did not want Jay to see the sadness in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could feel her wrist almost slipping out of his fingertips. Maybe she would fall just like how she had fallen into the sea one or two seconds later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was not going to have the same luck this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She took five years to return to his side, hoping she could stay with him a little longer and spend more time with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could give her all to this man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now, she just wanted him to live the rest of his life well. Perhaps... she should not have come back at all. She should not have restored his memory and let him fall in love with her. That way, he would not have suffered...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace waited for her body to fall and for the pain to overcome her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the next moment, a hand gripped her arm and she heard his voice shouting, "Grace, how could you... How could you do this again? If you're gone, how can I live..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace suddenly opened her eyes and looked at Jason's hands in disbelief. Both his hands were grabbing onto her arm, which meant he had let go of the helicopter's rope ladder!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If the ground beneath him collapsed, both of them would die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What... are you doing? Do you realize that you&rsquo;re killing&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So what? I don't care. I didn't catch you last time and could only watch you fall into the sea... But not again. I&rsquo;ll hold your hand..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would not let go even if they would fall to their demise together!</p></div>
