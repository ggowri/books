        <h1>Chapter 1962</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As the party continued, Emily Flowers smiled as she watched her son walk toward the lounge on the second floor with a faint blush on his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Everything was going exactly as she wanted. Miss Keller was already waiting there. After tonight, the Stephenson family and the Tang family's marriage would be decided. Lina would have nothing to do with them anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers counted the time in her mind while drinking wine and exchanging pleasantries with the guests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, there was suddenly a loud noise on the second floor, followed by dead silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The guests looked at each other in confusion, not knowing what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers had a forced smile on her face as she went to the second floor to check, only to find two of Hadwin's men standing in front of the lounge Miss Keller was in. The men she had arranged were nowhere to be seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you..." Emily Flowers said with a puzzled look on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Stephenson said to let Miss Keller and Madam's men have a good rest in this lounge so they won't get too tired!" they replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" Emily Flowers was startled. She immediately went forward to open the door, only to see Miss Keller collapsed on the couch while fully dressed. Her two men were lying on the floor, all tied up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her son was nowhere to be seen in the lounge. It was obvious he was not here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where's Hadwin?" she asked sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They said, "Mr. Stephenson said he's going home first. He also asked you to stop doing such nonsense in the future, Madam!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers gritted her teeth hard, knowing that her son had seen through it all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She would have to appease the Tang family after this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson sat in the back of the car, enduring the strange feeling in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He smiled bitterly, surprised that his mother would make a move on him. He was wary of outsiders but not his own mother. That was why he fell for her dirty tricks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He should have known what his mother was like, but now it only made him see the truth more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the car drove to the Stephenson family&rsquo;s mansion, Hadwin Stephenson walked into the main house while ordering the butler with a slight gasp, "No one is allowed to enter the main house without my permission."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The butler froze. "But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before he could finish, Hadwin Stephenson had walked into the main house and shut the door with a bang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Miss Sweeney is still inside." The second half of the butler's words went unheard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson walked to the living room, he suddenly stopped. The living room lights were on. Lina was sitting on the couch in the living room, and an exquisite cake with digit candles stating his age was on the coffee table in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was dressed in a white dress while her hair was tied loosely. The light fell on her face and body, making her look lovely. She smiled when she saw him come in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin, you're back! Wait while I light the candles," she said as she lit the candles with a lighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks..." Hadwin Stephenson said gruffly, wanting to go upstairs right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina went forward, looked at Hadwin Stephenson's unusually red face, and asked, "What's come over you? Are you okay?" She raised her hand to touch his forehead as she spoke.</p></div>
