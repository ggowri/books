        <h1>Chapter 3580</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forget it, things are fine the way they are now," Veronica said. He wouldn't be trapped by her side and could pursue a broader world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow family would no longer suck the blood of the Reed family like parasites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for herself, she doesn't need to worry or be afraid. The issue is that she can't give him the kind of affection he wants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps this is already the best ending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper bit his lip and suddenly said, "But Veronica, don't you feel regretful?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked up at Jasper, feeling a bit confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper continued, "There are some things that if you miss, you may regret for a lifetime, just like me..." She chuckled self-deprecatingly. "I broke off my friendship with Lawrence back then, but later, when he got into trouble, I realized how childish I was. I don't know if Lawrence is still alive now, but if he is, he must hate me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's voice paused for a moment. "I always think that if time could be turned back, I would never break off my friendship with Lawrence. I would help him and his family, and I would never let myself regret it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, there was a knock on the door. After a moment, William walked in. "Jasper, the charity auction is about to start."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper turned to Veronica and said, "Well, Veronica, I'm going out first. You can continue to rest here for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Veronica nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stood up and left with William. Veronica watched their backs and couldn't help but show a hint of envy in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William has always been by Jasper's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she used to have someone by her side, from childhood to adolescence... but now... she's left alone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper and William arrived at the charity auction site.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The items being auctioned off were all donated by guests today, and the host would introduce each item, including who the donor was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there anything you want?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Asking this question also meant that if there was something she liked, he would bid for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," Jasper shook her head. For her, the donated jewelry or limited edition bags usually didn't attract her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, as the host moved on to the next item, it was announced that this particular item had been donated by an anonymous individual. It was a piece of incomplete sheet music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Jasper immediately looked up at the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the large screen displayed above the stage was the content of the incomplete sheet music. The paper was yellowed and looked to be quite old, but the music caught Jasper's eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the sheet music for "The Old Wind," a piece created by a famous musician over a century ago. However, due to the turmoil of war, the sheet music was incomplete.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite this, there were many copies of the incomplete sheet music, and in the music community, there were many people willing to complete the piece.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone has a different feeling towards a piece of music, and the completed composition is also different for each person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at this music score and listened to the host saying that the anonymous donor claimed it was an authentic piece, but they didn't have an expert to authenticate it, so it couldn't be confirmed whether it was genuine or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Jasper had a feeling that this should be an authentic piece as he looked at the music score.</p></div>
