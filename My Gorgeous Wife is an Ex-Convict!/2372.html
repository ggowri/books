        <h1>Chapter 2370</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you told Martin Weiss?" Grace asked. After all, nothing could go wrong if they wanted to prevent Jacqueline Bowman from sensing that something was amiss on the day. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, he promised to cooperate with us," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good. I&rsquo;ll take care of the rest, then. You only have to act as usual," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Kyla. After the trial three days later, she would find out Amber Mitchell's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Amber Mitchell... Amber Mitchell... I must find Amber Mitchell no matter what!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Kyla said to Martin Weiss, "Grace said Jacqueline Bowman's trial is being held in three days. When the time comes..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it. I'll keep my word," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He peered at her. "Do you care so much about Amber Mitchell because she helped you in prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "Yeah. Many people will send you flowers when you're at your prime, but not many will help you when you're at your lowest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that why you can bear the humiliation, beg me for her, and disregard your dignity for Amber Mitchell?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyelashes quivered slightly as she looked down a little. "It's because Amber Mitchell saved my and Nelson's lives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So if I had helped you find out the truth and not put you in prison unjustly, would you..." His voice broke off abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He almost asked her if she would have continued to love him deeply and forgive him even after finding out that he had deliberately approached her for revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Forget it. It's pointless to talk about that now," said Martin Weiss before turning around and going into the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled mournfully and murmured to herself, "Yeah, it's pointless to talk about that now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three days later, Jacqueline Bowman's trial began as scheduled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was afraid there would be media, but her trip to court was desolate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she gave it another thought and realized that the news was suppressed when it first broke, so there was not much coverage. Even the occasional relevant news was removed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was normal to have no media present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was the best outcome for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She saw Mr. Lambert when she came into the courtroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert was a far cry from what he looked like when Jacqueline Bowman first met him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman resented Mr. Lambert so much, thinking it was his fault that she was in this situation now. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trial was not open to the public, so there were no irrelevant people here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman looked at her defense lawyer&mdash;Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The wife of Emerald City's famous Young master Reed as well as Kyla's best friend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went to the detention center to interview her and said she would be her defense lawyer, she was shocked. She did not expect the defense lawyer Kyla hired for her to be Young master Reed's wife.</p></div>
