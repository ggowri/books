        <h1>Chapter 4097</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when the security personnel saw Chandler writhing in pain on the ground, they were shocked and quickly averted their gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forget everything you saw tonight and don't say a word about it!" Mr. Hunter glared at the security personnel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, sir," the person replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can go outside and wait," the old man said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The security personnel left the room and closed the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the room, Tina quickly crouched down and asked Chandler, "Chandler, what's wrong with you? Didn't you find a cure for your illness?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As soon as her hand touched Chandler, he pushed her away abruptly, accompanied by a low growl, "Don't touch me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina's hand was left hanging in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She stared at him in shock. It was the first time Chandler had ever pushed her away and yelled at her like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, we have indeed found Chandler's medicine," Mr. Hunter's voice suddenly came from behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina urgently turned to the old man and said, "Then give the medicine to Chandler right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Actually, the medicine is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Don't say it!" Chandler suddenly shouted, his eyes, which had turned crimson at some point, staring fiercely at his grandfather. "This is between me and Tina, Grandpa...you can't say a word!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, Mr. Hunter calmly looked at him and said, "This is not just between you and her, it's also a matter for the Hunters."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Grandpa...please!" Chandler pleaded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But Mr. Hunter did not agree with Chandler. Instead, he turned to Tina and said, "His medicine is you. If you want to relieve his pain, only you can do it now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler was full of anger at these words, while Tina was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, if you spend the night with Chandler, he should not be in so much pain," the old man said, without batting an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was dumbfounded. Spend the night with him...it couldn't be what she was thinking, could it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Or would you rather watch him suffer like this?" the old man asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course not! I don't want to see Chandler suffer like this!" Tina denied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's good!" Mr. Hunter said and then walked out of the church.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Tina and Chandler could react, the door suddenly closed and they heard the sound of it being locked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina shuddered and immediately ran to the door, trying to open it, but it was locked from the outside and she couldn't open it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's no use!" Chandler struggled to sit up, making a simple movement that seemed to use all his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grandpa deliberately locked him and Tina in the same room, so there was no possibility of them being released before dawn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do we do now?" Tina was at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should she try to break down the door directly? But the door looked very sturdy, and the window was on the ceiling, so it was impossible to climb out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Find a way to tie me up with something like a rope," Chandler said laboriously, his handsome face twisted with pain and covered in a flush.</p></div>
