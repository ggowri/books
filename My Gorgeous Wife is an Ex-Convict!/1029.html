        <h1>Chapter 1028</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not&hellip; Not yet. I'm just wondering if I'm pregnant," Lina explained quickly. She moved a little uncomfortably. She was a little embarrassed by the way he was looking at her stomach. "Besides, my period hasn't come this month,&rdquo; she added lamely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He mused, 'If that's the case, it's possible that she's pregnant. However... if she's pregnant, then I'm&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll find out if you're pregnant by going to the hospital tomorrow for a blood test," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she heard that she had to go to the hospital for a blood test, she felt a tingle in her scalp. "We don't have to go to the hospital for a blood test, do we? Why don't we just buy a pregnancy test and test it out first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was rendered speechless and looked at her. "Are you afraid of drawing blood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded honestly before saying, "Get out of the car and buy a pregnancy test when you pass by some pharmacy or something. Uh, you'd better buy several different brands just in case."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, when Hadwin Stephenson arrived at the pharmacy and bought every type of pregnancy test on the shelf, the cashier looked at him strangely. The way she looked at Hadwin Stephenson made him feel like he was one of those perverts in TV shows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in the car, he handed all the pregnancy tests to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina started studying the pregnancy test kits with all her heart and soul. She even took out the instructions and studied them carefully with a curious and excited look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at Hadwin Stephenson's mansion where she could do the pregnancy tests, she immediately felt nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do we do? Hadwin Stephenson, I'm so nervous!" said Lina as she could not help grabbing Hadwin Stephenson's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she realized the layer of sweat in his palm once she grabbed his hand. She immediately looked at him in surprise. "Are you... nervous too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I'm nervous," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes. He had never been this nervous before. He had never felt so nervous even when he counterattacked and won the place as the Stephenson family's patriarch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now he was nervous about whether she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got less nervous when she saw him so nervous. "Alright, alright, calm down. It's just a pregnancy test. Just wait!" She was now the one to comfort him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Lina heroically walked into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stood at the bathroom door, giving a wry smile as he looked down at his hands. He would never have believed that one day he would get so nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was even feeling so perturbed at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If she&rsquo;s really pregnant, that&rsquo;ll just bind her to me even more. Even if it means... I&rsquo;m using our child!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was also afraid that she was pregnant. 'If she&rsquo;s pregnant, then maybe she&rsquo;ll be involved in the Stephenson family's&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The Stephenson family is&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Hadwin Stephenson was in a dilemma, Lina suddenly pushed the bathroom door open. However, she did not leave the bathroom. She just poked her head out and said, "Well... I... I don't think I'm pregnant. I think my period just came."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was stunned and took a while to realize what she was saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Not pregnant&hellip;' He seemed to feel a little disappointed but felt that maybe it was for the best for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been careless and never used contraception with her, almost dragging her into danger.</p></div>
