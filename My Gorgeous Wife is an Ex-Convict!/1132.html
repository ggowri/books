        <h1>Chapter 1131</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was shocked. The door was not locked when he opened it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's head over to the police station first!" the policeman said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go with you," said Brian as he took Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I'll go by myself," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, instead of letting go, Brian insisted and said, "I'll go with you! I was the first witness after the door opened." His phoenix eyes looked straight at her as if he would dilly-dally with her like this if she refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no choice but to nod and agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she refused, Brian did not need her permission to go to the police station. Besides, as he said, he was the first witness since he was the one who opened the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the crowd outside the door and pulled Grace behind him. "Hide behind me and walk forward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Brian had already led Grace forward when she was still in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many crew members and shopping mall customers were around, but there were more fans of the cast there. They were all looking this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though a few security guards shielded them on their way out, a few people still tried to push their way over. They were even pointing their phones at Grace to take a picture of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian kept Grace behind him so that they could not get a picture of her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't look up, just follow me!" Brian's voice rang softly in Grace's ears, and she immediately felt calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like&hellip; when they were in the forest when they were children, and it was always dreadfully dark when night came. He had held her hand tightly, saying, "Don't be afraid. Just... Just lean on me. You... You can sleep next to me. I won't fall asleep at night and I&rsquo;ll keep guard. I'm braver than you anyway, so I'm not afraid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hands were slightly trembling when he said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A faint smile could not help appearing on the corners of Grace's lips at the thought of that moment. The world children lived in was so much simpler than an adult's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps because of this, people particularly missed their childhood when they grew up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Brian out of the mall and got into a car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only then that the film crew's eyes fell on Stella as their expressions began to warp. They looked at her with either sarcastic, sympathetic, or disdainful looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella felt like she was slapped in the face. She had been the one everyone tried to curry favor with, and many people secretly thought she might be Brian's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, even though Brian had previously said in the interview that he had someone he loved, he never publicly revealed who it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, some people thought that Brian was just trying to cover up the truth and that his girlfriend was actually Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian's actions today seemed to tell everyone around them who he loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did this happen? Why did the plan I thought of so hard not work out? Grace even managed to subdue Robert Brewer. It's so infuriating!'</p></div>
