        <h1>Chapter 3875</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, someone poured soup on you?" Mason asked Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he had arrived earlier, his attention had been focused on her hospital test results. Now he noticed that she was wearing different clothes than she had been in the morning, and her hair was still slightly damp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica nodded awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did it burn you?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, the soup wasn't hot, so it didn't burn me," Veronica replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why didn't you tell me about this?" Mason asked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It wasn't a big deal, and I was planning on handling it myself," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If something like this happens again, you should call me immediately!" Mason said. He was relieved that the soup wasn't hot; he didn't even want to imagine what would have happened if it had been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand," she said, understanding his concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank goodness you're okay," Mason hugged Veronica tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was startled by this sudden gesture, especially since they were in the hospital waiting area and there were still many patients around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even though she blushed, she didn't push Mason away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because she could feel his concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine, I'll take good care of myself. Getting splashed with hot soup this time was an accident. I'll be more careful next time," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the two embracing in front of her, Shirley, the third wheel, quickly said, "Veronica, since Mason is here to accompany you, I'll head back to school first. Let me know the results when they come out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Shirley left, Veronica checked the time and it was almost time to retrieve her report. So she decided to go to the machine to scan the code and get the report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Give me the barcode, I'll get it for you," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh," Veronica replied and handed the barcode needed to retrieve the report to Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The machine was just a few steps away from the waiting area. Veronica sat in her seat and could clearly see Mason retrieving the report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The machine spit out the report, and Veronica only saw Mason pick it up, lower his head to look at the report, and then stand still in the same spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could understand the report?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned for a moment and was about to get up, but she saw Mason raise his head and look at her. His gaze was both joyful and worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that instant, even though Veronica hadn't seen the report yet, she could tell that she was probably pregnant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pregnant... Was there a little life inside her belly right now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason walked up to Veronica and said, "Your HCG and progesterone levels are higher than normal, so you must be pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you understand it?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's simple enough to understand," he replied. On the way there, he had searched online and knew that the two data points were the main indicators of pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them walked towards the gynecology clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, let's get married," Mason suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stopped in her tracks and looked at him in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although I originally planned to wait until you graduated before we got married, if you are really pregnant, I hope we can move up the wedding. As for your studies, you will graduate in six months, and whether you want to finish your studies first or have the baby first, I respect your choice," Mason said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica blinked her eyes. Although she had thought about having the baby after realizing she was pregnant, she had forgotten that she needed to get married first.</p></div>
