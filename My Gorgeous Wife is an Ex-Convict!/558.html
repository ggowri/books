        <h1>Chapter 557</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was pretty good-looking and was good to her. Why would she not put the same passion for fangirling over celebrities on him? He had not even seen a picture of him on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were looking at Howell Webb?" He looked through her phone and saw that she had just been chatting with Grace. The photos of the posters were sent to her by Grace, and the words Lina used in their conversation made her sound just like&hellip; A perverted lady!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more he looked, the more angry Hadwin felt. This woman... It seemed that he had to let her know once again whose girlfriend she was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Lina was quite blunt. "Grace was so lucky. Jason took her to see Howell Webb's movie premiere and she saw Howell Webb in person. Howell Webb gave her these posters."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's just an actor. What's so good about a few posters?" said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina heard this and was suddenly displeased. She raised her eyebrows. "Why, do you despise actors?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's face darkened even more as he looked at her beautiful black eyes. "What, are you going to defend him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cold voice was threatening. Lina was alarmed and immediately chickened out. Fangirling was precious, but the price of her life was higher!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm just saying!" Lina said lamely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Hadwin asked with a half-smile. "Tell me, how much do you like Howell Webb?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Just so-so." She chuckled drily. She was not a fool. Even if she quite liked him, she could not say it directly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she seemed to &lsquo;like&rsquo; a lot of celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about me? How much do you like me?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina straightened up immediately and put on a serious expression, saying, "I think I like you now. I miss you every day when I don't see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This little liar!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin thought to himself. Just from her expression, he could tell that she was lying. There were many women chasing him around even before he became the patriarch of the Stephenson family. Now that he was the patriarch of the Stephenson family, more women were looking for opportunities to approach him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He allowed her to approach him, but she always muddled through it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you miss me, why don't you save my pictures on your phone?" he asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid your photos will only make me miss you more," she replied smoothly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost pissed him off. This little liar was even perfunctory in making an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a look on her face that said, &lsquo;Give me back my phone&rsquo;. It made Hadwin so angry that he just tossed the phone back to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina got her phone back, she began to eat her midnight snack in peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, one of the advantages of dating Hadwin was that she could eat a lot of things that she could not eat before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Hadwin's voice suddenly rang in her ear again. "Speaking of which, we're already boyfriend and girlfriend, but why do you seem reluctant to be intimate with me? Didn't you say you think of me every day? Or am I not as charming as Howell Webb?"</p></div>
