        <h1>Chapter 3104</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, she realized that there was a film crew shooting here. At the moment, the actors of the crew were filming in a location not far from the restroom, so many fans of the actors crowded over here, making it particularly crowded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many fans held up signs and continuously waved them during breaks in filming, shouting their idol's name loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said to the person crowded in front of her, "Excuse me, can I please borrow your way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person impatiently said, "Can't you just walk to the side?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next to her... Valda's gaze fell on a temporary fence that had been erected on one side of the crowd. The fence was positioned low and an ordinary person could easily step over it. However, for Valda, the height posed a challenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially since it was just a quick trip to the restroom, she didn't bring her cane with her. Instead, she hobbled over one step at a time. Without her cane to support her, attempting to step over the high railing could easily cause her to lose her balance and fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My legs are not very convenient, so I can't walk over there. Could you please make way for me?" Valda said somewhat awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it inconvenient?" The other person looked her up and down and said, "Is it because you have a limp?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was just a casual remark, but Valda felt even more embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person suddenly burst into laughter, "Oh my god, you really are a cripple!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you have a limp, why did you come out? You should just stay at home!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, ugly people are always doing weird things! And they want us to make way for them? No way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Other fans around them chimed in without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face turned red, and she tightly clenched the hand hanging by her side. "This is supposed to be a normal passage, but you're blocking the way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what? If you have the ability, you can walk on the other side of the railing. There's no one blocking you over there. Look, many people are walking over there, aren't they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, you can't even step over it." The mocking voices made Valda's face even uglier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, an assistant from the crew came over with a loudspeaker and said, "Hey, can you guys move aside a bit? Otherwise, you'll be in the shot. Thanks for your cooperation!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those people immediately moved to another position obediently upon hearing these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Valda's figure was exposed in front of everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, what are you doing standing here? Move out of the way!" The assistant holding a megaphone impatiently said, "Don't you know you're affecting our filming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words drew everyone's attention to Valda, and some confused fans even shouted at her, "Are you stupid? Move out of the way like he said!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't delay the shooting, can you afford to compensate if time is wasted?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't understand human language, do you? I told you to leave quickly. You're not thinking of being filmed and appearing on TV, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face turned red and then green, as she slowly walked away, shuffling her feet step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, there were sounds of surprise from the surroundings, followed by mocking laughter.</p></div>
