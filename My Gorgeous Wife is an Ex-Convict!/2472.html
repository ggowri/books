        <h1>Chapter 2470</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not expect this man to be Jason from Emerald City. He had naturally heard about the Reed family of Emerald City and knew their status in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was surprising that such a person would get involved in Amber Mitchell's affairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed, I didn't expect to see you again," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled. "Mr. Gregory, I'm afraid it's not inappropriate for you to intrude into another patient&rsquo;s ward like this. If I report this to the police, it might hurt your reputation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm only here to meet someone I used to know. Now that I've met her, it's time for me to go," George Gregory said as he glanced at Amber Mitchell, who was sitting up on the hospital bed. "It seems I did the right thing by not marrying you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell smiled, but her eyes were full of disappointment. "It's a good thing I didn't marry you either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory left with his men. Grace came over and asked, "Are you okay? He didn't do anything to you, did he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell shook her head. "He just said some things that don't matter. It's nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yeah, it would not affect her no matter what George Gregory said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect him to barge in with his men. I'll ask Jay to station more men in front of the ward," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you. I wonder when I can return the favor," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no need to return the favor. I'm helping you because of Kyla and because I think you don't deserve to be treated this way. There's justice in this world," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Justice?" Amber Mitchell's eyes could not help getting wet. If there was justice, would she be able to find out who caused the accident and killed Herman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Herman...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking back to the moment of the crash, he had turned the steering wheel around to bear the brunt of the force himself. At the moment of impact, he unbuckled his seat belt and threw himself on top of her, shielding her with all his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His last words rang out in her ears... &lsquo;Amber Mitchell, you must live a good life.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Live a good life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was imprisoned in the mental hospital and thinking that she was about to lose her mind from the torture, Herman&rsquo;s words always rang in her ears. They stopped her from wanting to kill herself. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was no longer living for herself but for Herman. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to find out the real culprit of the car accident and get justice for Herman. She could not waste the life Herman tried so hard to save!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The consultation with the specialists is in a couple of days. We'll find out whether you're mentally ill by then. Just try to rest and relax for the next two days. Be at your best for the consultation," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it. I won't waste this hard-won opportunity," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a few more words of advice before leaving with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the ward, Amber Mitchell looked down at her mutilated right hand and murmured, "Herman, you'll protect me, right? I'm sure I'll do well during the consultation in two days, and then..." She would be truly free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could only do some things when one was truly free!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
