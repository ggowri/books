        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ah? In the car?" The group leader was clearly stunned. He was surprised that a ring worth hundreds of thousands of dollars had been lost and that the two women had decided not to supervise the search.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"After all, our Lily is a popular celebrity. If she were to stand here and watch you searching for the ring, it would probably only be moments before she got surrounded by movie fans," Annabelle said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The group leader thought so too. And probably didn&rsquo;t want any bad press for the Sanitation Center. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Please go about your day. We&rsquo;ll contact you the moment we find something.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily's car was parked nearby. Even if she sat in the car, she could still easily see Grace, digging through the garbage, looking dejected and insignificant.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She's only qualified to go through rubbish," Annabelle said cruelly with a smile. "Despite how she was so smug moments ago, she still has to wade through a garbage dump now."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily calmly replied, "Let's leave after a bit."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's current appearance was making her seem not as threatening.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though this woman was once loved by Sean, in the end, she was also abandoned by him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And yet, back in the prison, even when all ten of Grace's fingertips had been bleeding, all fingernails ripped out and all of the bones in her fingers had been broken, she still insisted that she was framed and that she was innocent!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why did that woman suffer through such pain and still insist that she was innocent? Did she actually think that if she persisted in proclaiming her innocence that she would not really be guilty? Or that they&rsquo;d somehow believe her and go easy?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jennifer was dead!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The law looked at the evidence!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh right, best to commemorate it," Annabelle said and took out her phone to take a picture of Grace inside the huge dumpster, hefting broken bags and sifting through all kinds of refuse and rotting food.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Annabelle shook her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re in the car and going to leave. Can you imagine that stench?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace did not know when this farce would end but it was clear that it would be impossible to get off work at her usual time. She had also gotten Claire and several other coworkers in trouble by making them stay behind with her to look for a non-existent ring.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace removed the plastic gloves she was wearing and reached for her phone to dial a number. "Jay, it's me, today I'm... there are some issues at the center, I'm afraid I'll not be back until very late. Make a little something for yourself for dinner, you don't have to wait for me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A strong male voice rang out from the other end of the phone. "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just hearing his voice brightened her spirits.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just... uh, some work-related issues. Anyway, you don't have to wait for me," she replied. She saw that the group leader was glaring at her and she hurriedly ended the call. She put on her gloves again and continued to look through the trash.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the president's office of the Reed Group...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason gave an order to his secretary. &ldquo;Terrence, go and look into what's happened to Grace at the Sanitation Service Center."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Terrence agreed dutifully and left the president's office.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Contemplation flashed through Jason's eyes. In the call just now, he could clearly sense that she was hiding something, but... what was she hiding?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence was able to uncover the incident with minimal effort. "Lily is alleging that she has lost a ring worth hundreds of thousands. She called the director of the Sanitation Service Center, and he ordered Miss Cummins to go through the rubbish then and there to look for the ring."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence called Lily by her full name but addressed Grace respectfully, which proved both of their statuses within Jason's heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's eyes narrowed immediately. "Go through the rubbish?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The iciness of his tone made Terrence freeze. "Yes."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is it worth going through rubbish for one stupid ring?" Jason laughed coldly. He muttered to himself momentarily before continuing, "Since Lily likes searching for rings so much, then let her look for it properly until she's had enough of it!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence had been at Jason's side for many years and was aware that his employer had lost his temper.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was so rare.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Throughout these years, there have only been a few incidents that have angered Mr. ReedMr. Reed. And at this moment, he&rsquo;d never seen his boss more furious.</p></div>
