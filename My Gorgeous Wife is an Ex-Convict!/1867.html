        <h1>Chapter 1865</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where on earth are you keeping my mentor and his wife?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Have you come to question me?" His eyes instantly turned cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Watts has a fever. At her age, a minor fever may cause all kinds of diseases. Jay, even if you want Mrs. Watts to atone for her sins, get a doctor for her first," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason got up and walked over to her. "What's the matter? Do you think I locked them away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Didn't you?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just found them a place where that woman can repent. Your mentor can leave whenever he wants. As for the person I once called my mother, she can also leave if she wants to&mdash;but her only option outside is prison.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As Jason said this, he bent over slightly and stared at Grace with a half-smile on his face as if he was mocking her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze, suddenly realizing why her mentor had not left. He was afraid that if he did leave to get a doctor or report to the police, Jay would send Mrs. Watts straight to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jay's legal team could win the case easily. After all, there was a lot of evidence about what had happened that year. Even though her mentor was a big shot in the legal world, they would lose the case anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Will you tell me where they are?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason suddenly sneered. "Didn't you promise that you&rsquo;d stand by me and not plead for that woman? Or did you not mean them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I did promise I wouldn&rsquo;t plead with you for them, but let me see them at least. Don&rsquo;t keep me from knowing where they are!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But Grace, so what if you know where they are?" Jason raised his hands and gently embraced Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His movements were very gentle, and his voice seemed to be muttering sweet words. However, what he said made her heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I won't tell you where they are. They made the decision to stay there. Stay out of this. Since you said I matter the most to you, are you willing to hurt me again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace only felt her heart sinking deeper. It was as if there were two forces in her body tugging at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, is making your mother atone for her sins really what you want? This has burdened your mother over the years. There&rsquo;s an unnamed memorial tablet in my mentor's house. Mrs. Watts takes care of it. My mentor said it was because she did someone wrong and hasn't had a day of peace in the past 20 years. Mrs. Watts has always regretted it. She turned vegetarian and prayed to Buddha, hoping that person can rest in peace. I think it's probably your father. Mrs. Watts&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Stop!" interrupted Jason as he slowly released his arms. He put his hands on her shoulders and looked down at her, saying, "Don't say another word if you don't want to hurt me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His gaze made her throat dry. It was as if something was blocking everything she wanted to say. She could not say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if one more word would break a taboo and cause an irreparable rift in their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His gaze was telling her silently that he hated his mother very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The hatred was so overwhelming!</p></div>
