        <h1>Chapter 1973</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That same woman who looked poised but cold almost caused her unborn child to miscarry by beating her up. Lina did not have a good impression of Emily Flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she never expected her to drug her own son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could almost guess why. After all, news had reported that Emily Flowers invited many socialites in tMason Swansonty to attend his birthday party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Some even said it was a blind date party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina bit her lip and said, "She... She's against us being together, isn't she? If she continues to refuse, then you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "I'm no longer her pawn. It's up to me to decide what to do. My mother won't be bothering you again for years, and I won't let her harm our child. They&rsquo;ll be born safely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She let out a sigh of relief. "No matter what happens, even if your mother objects, I&rsquo;ll still pester you. You said it yourself. You want me to keep pestering you and not give up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could not help chuckling. The woman sometimes depressed him, but she never failed to cheer him up when he was in a bad mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, Lina, you promised me you'll keep pestering me! I'll never forgive you if you fail to keep your word!" His voice captured her like a dense web.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson Corbyn, your mother is an ex-convict. How dare you reject me when I don't even look down on you for that?&rdquo; The girl's voice was haughty and angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if being rejected was a great shame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace, who was on her way to the principal's office, could not help but stop when she heard the voice. It was because she heard the words &lsquo;Nelson Corbyn&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just because you like me doesn't mean I should like you back. Besides, my mother was wronged. The law has already cleared her name," Nelson Corbyn said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked in the direction of the voice and saw Nelson Corbyn standing opposite a girl, who was blocking his way domineeringly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So what? She&rsquo;s still an ex-convict. If you won't be my friend, I'm going to tell everyone at school that your mother is an ex-convict and that they shouldn't go to your store!" the girl said with a complacent smile on her young face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was somewhat surprised. 'The girl seems to be about the same age as Nelson. Do nine-year-old children behave like this nowadays?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This girl was not innocent like how children her age should be. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">From Grace's point of view, she could not see Nelson's expression but could see that the hands by his sides were clenched into fists. His shoulders seemed to be trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The girl seemed even more proud now. "Hmph, if you don't want the whole school to know that your mother is an ex-convict and have your store go out of business, you'll be obedient and do exactly what I tell you to do! Here, I want you to say you like me in front of everybody&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That won't do, my dear!" Grace's voice interrupted the girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn turned his head and froze at the sight of Grace, while the girl said with an angry face, "Who are you, old lady? Do you have anything to do with our affairs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why would I have nothing to do with my godson's affairs?" Grace smiled faintly, but there was something fierce in the way she looked at the little girl. "Let me tell you, what you just said to Nelson is called a threat in law. I'm a lawyer, and I can tell you that this crime is punishable by imprisonment."</p></div>
