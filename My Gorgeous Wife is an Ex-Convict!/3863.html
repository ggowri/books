        <h1>Chapter 3861</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Control himself? Control himself from what?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It took Veronica a moment to realize what he meant, and then her face turned red again as her gaze involuntarily shifted downwards towards Mason's lower body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can he... not resist it either?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you keep staring there, it will only make me unable to resist more," Mason suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was startled and quickly lifted her head, her gaze moving to Mason's face. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... um, look there, I was just a little curious..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You seem to blush very easily, how many times have you blushed today?" Mason put down what he was holding and bent down to look at Veronica. "But if you're curious, you can only be curious about me, you can't be curious about other men, understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She nodded embarrassedly. She wasn't a pervert, how could she be curious about men's private parts?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, in front of others, you can't blush like this," he continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She blinked and heard him say, "Because your blushing face is too alluring, so this look can only be seen by me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was speechless. He didn't say it like that, and besides... alluring? Clearly, he was the more alluring one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, he slept on the bedroll on the floor, while she slept on the bed. But as long as she leaned her head a little, she could see him lying on the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, can I hold your hand?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure." He responded and reached out his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She also reached out her hand, and their hands held together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Holding hands like this made her feel more at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you think will happen to us in the future?" she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After graduating from college, we'll get married. Then you can do whatever you want. If you want to pursue a career, you can pursue a career. If you want to stay at home and be a housewife, you can stay at home. Everything is up to you." He said, he just wanted her to be happy. "And when you feel it's appropriate, we'll have children. You can have as many as you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica almost choked on her own saliva. "Uh, how many children do you want? Do you like kids?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not really," he admitted frankly. He didn't have any special feelings towards those little brats. When his mother gave birth to his fourth sister, he felt like he had gained another family member, but he didn't feel much inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't have the ecstatic feeling that other big brothers had. He could only say that he had one more person to protect in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't like kids? Will you also not like our children?" Veronica suddenly became nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," Mason answered truthfully. He had always known that he seemed to be much less emotional than normal people when it came to feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emotions that others would have, he could hardly feel, or even if he did, it was only faint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was like watching some TV dramas. The characters in the dramas could make people tear up, but he didn't feel anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, if they are our children, even if I really don't have any feelings of liking towards them, I will make myself try to like them," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you don't like kids, why did you say you want to have several?" Veronica asked curiously.</p></div>
