        <h1>Chapter 595</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... Just over there." She pointed to the clothing shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To her surprise, Brian followed her into the shop, saying that she was now wrapped in his suit jacket and that he would take it back once she had changed her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had to quickly change into a cheap T-shirt from the shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Grace picked out her clothes, Jason was in Reed Group's president's office. He was listening to his private secretary, Terrence's, reports with a gloomy face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, we've talked to all the news media. They&rsquo;re not allowed to publish any news about Miss Cummins, so these three media won&rsquo;t dare to publish it this time," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It started after all three media outlets simultaneously received anonymous emails with racy photos of Grace and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who did this? Did you find out the culprit?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're looking into it. They&rsquo;re obviously trying to keep themselves from being found out, so they've tampered with things," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Find out as fast as you can. I want to know who's behind this," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" Terrence replied quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You may go out first," said Jason. It was only after Terrence left the president's office that Jason clicked on the email in his inbox.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The email contained documents Terrence had sent him previously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He clicked on one of the documents which showed photos of Grace and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Under the moonlight, the man was holding the woman tightly. In some of the photos, Brian&rsquo;s face was buried in the woman's shoulder, and some of them had them looking at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They looked... Just like a couple...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His deep, amorous eyes darkened more and more. The back of his hand that was holding the mouse was bulging with blue veins. This was... Grace and Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did Grace let Brian hug her? What were they talking about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's pupils immediately constricted as he stared blankly at one of the photos which showed something slightly reflecting on Brian's face. Grace was looking at him with an unmistakable look of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian... Was crying!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly remembered the night before when she had talked to him about the topic of crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was the reason she talked about it... Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, his heart was filled with some kind of panic. What was going on between her and Brian that he did not know about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was trying his best to break the bond between her and Brian only to find that his efforts were completely useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was still a certain bond between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not know that Grace was the one he was looking for, but he still treated her differently. He&hellip; even cried in front of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What happened that night?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason subconsciously picked up his phone and dialed Grace's phone number!</p></div>
