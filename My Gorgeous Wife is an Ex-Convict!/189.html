        <h1>Chapter 188</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For someone like him, the gloves he usually wore should be those custom-made from a luxury brand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He watched her blank stare and added, &ldquo;Consider it as your thank you gift for me releasing those splendid relatives of yours.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked embarrassed. &ldquo;But I no longer have the measurements.&rdquo; Back then, she had used a measuring tape to measure the size of his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, she had no plans of completing the gloves so she threw the paper which recorded those measurements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve lost the measurements, then measure again,&rdquo; he said directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no choice but to take out the measuring tape, sit next to him, and measure the size of his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, it was unavoidable for her to be in contact with his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each time the tip of her fingers came in contact with his hand, she would be careful to avoid touching him as much as she could. She would even carefully hold the measuring tape with two fingers at the edge to carefully measure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chuckled at her actions. &ldquo;Yesterday you were so bold to hug and kiss me, but now it&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;re not willing to touch me at all. Why? Is touching me such a difficult thing for you to do?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s face reddened again. &ldquo;I... I was drunk at that time...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;So you mean to say that you&rsquo;re not willing to come in contact with me when you&rsquo;re sober?&rdquo; he stared at her as he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused for a moment and looked into his eyes which seemed to have some hints of mockery. She did not know what to say at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for him, he closed his eyes to cover up the shine on his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Sis, one day, I will make you touch me willingly. Right now, I will not force you to stay by my side. However, you best believe me. One day, you will beg to stay with me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That crisp and cold voice plainly spoke words as if he was merely chatting casually, but those words were like a clap of thunder that rumbled in Grace&rsquo;s ears, making her heart thump in a messy beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Willingly touch him. Willingly stay by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;How is that possible?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;We are people from different worlds. Furthermore... Jason, these three words... They represent immeasurable pain for me.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">-</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace arrived at the Sanitation Service Center in the afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Claire Watts noticed that Grace looked rather pale and weak, thus she caringly asked if Grace took half a day off because she was feeling unwell. Grace could only force out a smile and say that some issues had cropped up with her family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know what she should feel when she thought about her mission to complete Jason&rsquo;s gloves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, her mother&rsquo;s familial home called to inform her that her uncle and the rest had been released. They had visited her grandmother as well. Fortunately, her grandmother appeared to have improved slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they requested Grace to return home during the weekend as they needed to discuss the condition of her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hanging up, Grace felt heavy-hearted. The only person she was concerned about back at her familial home was her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whatever it was, she had to go back that coming weekend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the next few days, Jason did not appear in front of her. This made her feel relieved. She continued to work on that half-completed glove based on the measurements of his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Jason had not specified a deadline, she wanted to get it done as soon as possible. Unfortunately, she had never knitted gloves, so she was unfamiliar and kept making mistakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she knitted wrongly, she had to remove a portion and redo it all over again.</p></div>
