        <h1>Chapter 254</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, then I won't touch her," Brian said. "She&rsquo;s not the one I'm looking for, anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was hard to deny that she looked a lot like the person he was looking for. Sometimes, when he looked at her, he imagined that she was what that person would grow up to look like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, she just looked like her. She was not her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if she's the one you're looking for? Will you do something then?" Jason asked, raising his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face remained still, but his phoenix eyes seemed to be rippling with something no one could see even if they wanted to. "If she is, I won&rsquo;t let go even if I have to compete against you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason squinted. "So it's a good thing she's not, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Fortunately, she's not," Brian said and turned away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, she was not her. If she really was, then it would probably be difficult to deal with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian thought and unconsciously reached into his pocket to feel for the bracelet. How long would it take before he found her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finding her had almost become an obsession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace walked out of the dressing room, there was no one outside except Jason and a bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you done?" Jason saw that Grace was now wearing her usual clothes with her hair in a normal ponytail. She had removed her makeup and her face was now bare, but it looked so much more flattering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go, then," Jason said, naturally reaching out to grab Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She withdrew her hand almost subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his eyebrows slightly, his black eyes fixed on her. "Why, you don't want to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... can walk by myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I prefer to hold your hand," Jason said, reaching out again to grab her hand. "Sis can't go anywhere if I hold you like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His chatty tone struck a shudder through her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he had woven a dense web around her to take control of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want her future life to involve a man like him. She could not see through people like him, let alone figure out what was in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she accidentally annoyed him, her fate then would probably worse than her three years in jail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to pull her hand out of his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand had only moved a little before his fingers clasped hers more tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh," she exclaimed. Her eyebrows could not help but furrow together. She felt a pain on the back of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did I hurt you?" he said softly, his fingers slightly loosening. He had placed his fingers on the back of her hand, forgetting that there was a wound there that was not completely healed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly. "It's all right. You can let go of me now."</p></div>
