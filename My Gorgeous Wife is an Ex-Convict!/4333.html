        <h1>Chapter 4331 Refusal of Goodwill</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was very panicked and said, "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two bodyguards naturally wouldn't pay attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man is also a bully who is afraid of the hard. When he saw this, he suddenly ran away quickly and didn't forget to say, "Don't think this thing can end like this. You owe money, you don't want to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the man ran away, Harley walked forward and looked at Calvert, who was lying awkwardly on the ground, extending his hand. "Can you still stand up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked at the pale hand in front of him in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This hand is so slender and pure white, making Calvert feel ashamed for an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this hand really something he can touch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially at this moment, his hands were covered in dust and blood stains from the ground</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, "he replied in a low voice, struggling to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley saw this and withdrew his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is not the place you should come, it's dangerous. You go quickly, "Calvert said with difficulty, covering his abdomen with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place where I was hit just now is experiencing intermittent pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at the person in front of him, his face still covered in wounds, and the only beautiful thing was those eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems like I've seen him twice, and he looks like he's been beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have bodyguards around me, so even if there's really danger, there's no need to worry about anything, "Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because her father was worried that something might happen to her, she always had bodyguards around to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even so, this is not suitable for you, "Calvert said." Thank you for helping me today. Please leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert finished speaking and was about to cross Harley and leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pale hand suddenly grabbed Calvert's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was stunned and looked at the other person in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going now with all your injuries? "Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go home, "he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll take you home, "she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, my house is nearby. I'll be home in a moment, "Calvert said hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at this area and naturally knew that it was a famous "slum" in Emerald City, filled with various forms of violence, brawls, and struggles of the underprivileged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were normal, she wouldn't be here at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just now she accidentally saw his beaten figure in the car and suddenly called for the driver to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they had only seen each other once, and when he was beaten just now, his hands were holding his head, strangely enough, she could still recognize him at a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's quite incredible to think about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you can walk home safely like this? "Harley said." I'll take you back. Since you said it's nearby, I'll take you home. It shouldn't take much time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert tightly pursed his lips, he didn't want her to see his home, it would only make him even more embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? "Harley turned to look at Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to take me back, "he took a deep breath and once again refused her kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps she would dislike him for being so unkind as him, Calvert thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were originally people from two worlds. Even if she disliked him, it was natural, but at least he could maintain his last trace of dignity in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the so-called dignity seems a bit ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to what he said, Harley frowned again and said, "Wait a moment, then." She whispered to the bodyguard next to her.</span></p></div>
