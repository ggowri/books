        <h1>Chapter 1994</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If Lily were still alive and made him take on the Reed family, perhaps he would have agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So when are you going to bring William back to Deer City, Mr. Barlow?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm afraid not now. The little one wishes to stay with the Reed family for a while longer. When he wants to go back to Deer City with me, I'll come and take him back. As for William's living expenses, I'll send you a check shortly," said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows. Since he wanted to pay for his son, there was no reason for him to say no.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After the conversation, the two men got back into their respective cars, which drove off in opposite directions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was shocked when Jason told her about this that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What? William is Philip Barlow's son? Are you sure?" The Barlow family of Deer City was influential in the country. However, according to various gossip news, it was a family with intense internal strife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow was currently the head of the Barlow family and a famous bachelor in Deer City. He was 35 years old but never had a lover and showed no interest in women. Of course, there was no news of him being interested in men either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "Philip Barlow admitted today that William is his son. He probably did a DNA test. But it seems that William doesn&rsquo;t want to leave with him, so he said he'll take William back to Deer City when he wants to leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze and speculated, saying, "Is William unwilling to go because of Jasper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, the two children were very close. Jasper always went to William's room to sleep every night. She would always find her daughter in William's room when she went to look for her in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said with a half-smile, "Maybe. But he'll leave the Reed family and return to Deer City one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's true. After all, Philip Barlow is his biological father. They're father and son. The Barlow family is his real family," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason shook his head. "William will leave the Barlow family not because of the father and son bond or family, but because he&rsquo;ll find that he'll never get what he wants if he doesn't return to the Barlow family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not help laughing. "What does he want? What can a child want? It can only be toys, food, or maybe more friends. But William doesn't seem to be the type to like to make friends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason only laughed and said nothing. Men like Philip Barlow would probably be worried about keeping their son in someone else's home. It would not be long before he did something to make William understand the cruelty of reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, if the boy did go back to Deer City, Jasper would be losing a toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While Jasper's interest in William had not seemed to fade, Jason still did not want to keep him around his daughter. After all, William's mother was Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would make William leave the Reed family in a few years even if the Barlow family never came for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... the Barlow family... If the child returns to the Barlow family, what will happen in the future? What about Jasper?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason secretly laughed at himself for overthinking. Even if the child could become the heir of the Barlow family in the future and hold authority in the Barlow family, he would not let the boy hurt his daughter.</p></div>
