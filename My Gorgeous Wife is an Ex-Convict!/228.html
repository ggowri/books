        <h1>Chapter 227</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people even speculated that Jason left in anger after arguing with some other guests inside the hall. Others speculated that there were a lot of ladies around him today, so he left early because he could not stand them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In short, there were all kinds of speculations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was reading all the comments that were flooding in. She started to wonder what had happened to Jason that caused him to suddenly leave the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until there was a knock on the door that Grace got up to open it. She instantly choked when she saw the figure standing outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ahem... Cough..." She could not help coughing. For a moment, her face was flushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the person everyone online was now fervently discussing about would show up here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned slightly, raising his hand to pat Grace on the back and helping her to breathe properly again. "What's the matter? Why are you choking so badly? Do you have a cold?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She choked and shook her head. She did not have a cold. She was taken aback by his sudden appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace finally managed to catch her breath and looked at Jason. "Why&hellip; Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? Can't I be here?" he asked rhetorically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips together. Of course, he could come, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He entered her house and shut the door behind him. The small rented house was even smaller now because of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes fell on her left hand which was obviously red and swollen. "How did you hurt your hand? Did you hurt it when you were working as an extra?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he caught her wrist, took her left hand, and was about to put his fingers over the swelling on the back of her hand when she exclaimed, "Don't touch it, I've just applied ointment on it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers closed slightly, but he kept staring at the swelling on the back of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had only heard Patrick mention about groveling and kneeling earlier. He did not expect that her hand would be hurt to this extent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The swelling and redness were so glaring on her slender and fair hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was hit by a prop," Grace replied lightly. Then, as if she had thought of something, she looked at him in surprise and said, "You know I went to be an extra today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did, however, caught sight of a bruise on her forehead. This made his frown deepen. "Is this from the groveling today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gasped at the touch of his finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although her forehead was not as badly hurt as the back of her hand, there was a dull pain when she touched it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since he already knew that she went to be an extra today, it did not seem strange for him to know that she had groveled and knelt as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she groveled in front of a lot of people on set today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's sullen face looked as if people owed him a lot of debt. His cold expression caused the air pressure around him to lower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace kept her eyes wide open. She stared at Jason, not knowing why on earth he left the party early and popped into her house just to ask her if she was an extra today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her innocent and blank expression inexplicably made him feel more irritable.</p></div>
