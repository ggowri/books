        <h1>Chapter 1882</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young master Reed has been in the mourning hall for hours and hasn't come out. Young Madam, did something happen between you and Young master Reed?" Uncle Kwan said a little worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace did not know how to reply to him, so she hurriedly said, "I'll go look for him!" With that said, she ran in the direction of the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Uncle Kwan was about to say that Young master Reed had ordered that no one was allowed to enter the mourning hall, but he said nothing in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Young master Reed said no one is allowed... but Young Madam is often an exception! Besides, if something did happen between them, everything will be alright after Young Madam sees Young master Reed.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Uncle Kwan thought optimistically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace rushed into the mourning hall and saw Jason standing motionless in front of his father's memorial tablet. He looked just like a sculpture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The soft light in the room shone on him, but there was an indescribable chill exuding from his entire being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay..." Grace called out softly, but her voice was extremely dry and hoarse. She had not taken a sip of water since leaving Reed Residence early this morning. Her lips were drier than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason slowly turned around and looked at her with those bright peach blossom eyes. A slight smile appeared on his lips. "You're back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. He was smiling and looked as usual, but she felt cold. A chill ran down her spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because his eyes were so cold. It was as if she was only a stranger to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was no love or tenderness. Not even resentment or hatred... It was an emotionless gaze!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, I... I know what I did today has hurt you, and I'm sorry..." She opened her mouth and apologized with a hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He still smiled faintly and said, "You know what? My father once told me that it's best not to fall in love with anyone because when you're betrayed by the one you love, it feels like a knife stabbing into your body. Even your bones feel like they&rsquo;re being crushed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He spoke word by word as he slowly walked up to her. "Grace, do you know what it feels like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes seemed to freeze her blood, and his smile was so harsh. She loved his smile so much, but at this moment, she wished she would never see him smile like this again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, stop smiling!" she murmured. His smile seemed like a punishment to her, making her extremely miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Didn't you say you like to see me smile?" The once melodious voice now seemed to prick her eardrums like sharp needles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I know I&rsquo;ve hurt you. Just this once, Jay, will you forgive me just this once?" she pleaded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just this once?" He chuckled. "You knew you would hurt me but you did it anyway. Were you so sure I'd forgive you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I..." She tried to say something, but she realized that she could not say a word to defend herself when she opened her mouth.</p></div>
