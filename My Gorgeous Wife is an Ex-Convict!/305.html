        <h1>Chapter 304</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought of that night filled her with yet another pang of guilt. She had to blame it on her high spirits that day. She did not know how much she could drink and thought it would be all right to drink more fruit wine. In the end, drinking too much indeed caused trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had woken up and started to recall what happened when she was drunk&mdash;her pinning him down on the bed, her forcing herself upon him, and all the sweet talk that escaped her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whilst recalling this, Lina felt that they were so similar to those spoken by men to women on TV dramas! A few lines, in particular, were copied from the TV series she used to watch back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only come to the conclusion that it was not good to watch too many romantic dramas. When one was drunk, one would just spill sweet talk like it was free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end... she had succeeded! She succeeded at having her way with a handsome man she could only appreciate and not disrespect!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes when Lina recalled this, she wondered if her sweet talking worked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He might have stayed abroad for too long and did not how to react to the bombardment of domestic sweet talk. That was probably why she got away with it for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next morning, she woke up dumbstruck by what she saw. Then, she happened to receive a phone call from Grace, so she hurriedly checked out of her room and went home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only took that time as a romantic encounter. She also thought she might never see him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect that they would meet again under such circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I left a note," Lina said awkwardly. She had not exactly left without saying goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The irony in his eyes deepened with her words. "Yes, there was a note. It said, 'I'm sorry. I have to leave.' This was the only note you left for me, wasn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her shoulders could not help but shrink. All right, she knew it was her fault. "Then consider you're the one who was taken advantage of. What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pulled a long face and stared at her. After a long while, he finally said, "Have you sought me out all these years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip a little and did not reply, but the look on her face gave him the answer. She had not looked for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he chuckled, but his chuckle was a little cold. "Great, Lina. Just great!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had not looked for him over the years, but he traversed almost every part of the road they used to travel together and even turned M University upside down. He even went through the city's surveillance. He searched wherever he could find her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina only felt that the chuckle made her heart feel like it was being pinched. There was a surge of discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Hadwin's phone rang suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin answered the phone. After listening for a moment, his face changed slightly. Then, he looked at Lina with another touch of inquiry in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bring them here," Hadwin said. He ended the call and put the phone away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had a hunch that the phone call just now had something to do with her. "What is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason is here for you," Hadwin said, observing Lina. "I didn't expect Jason to come here for you. Why, do you know him well?"</p></div>
