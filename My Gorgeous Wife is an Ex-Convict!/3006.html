        <h1>Chapter 3004</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Yvo felt extremely distressed. What on earth is going on? He had thought that coming here today would be a good opportunity, but instead it turned out to be a situation where he was being accused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing next to him, Wendy was even more frightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How did Jason know about this? Who told him?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, something flashed through Wendy's mind. She looked up and glanced at Valda and Brian again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, she remembered. Weren't these two the ones she saw when she threatened Zoran Yeats at school?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, it's you guys. How dare you come here to complain to Mr. Reed!" Wendy rolled up her sleeves and was ready to confront the two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But when Wendy rushed forward, Brian stepped in front of Valda with a quick step. "Are you looking for trouble?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cold gaze and voice sent a chill down Wendy's spine, and she felt a sense of fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who is this man?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then Jason's voice sounded again, "It seems that this is true."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No...no, it's not like that," Wendy quickly explained, "It's...it's the art teacher who said something inappropriate to my child, causing my child to have psychological trauma. That's why I reported it to the education bureau. I believe that such a teacher must be removed from their position, otherwise more children will be affected."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Psychological shadow? Do you have a doctor's proof? And who heard what Mr. Yeats said to your child? Is there any evidence?" Valda spoke directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... My child has psychological trauma. As a mother, I know this. Isn't that enough? As for those excessive words, do you think my child would lie and slander the teacher?" Wendy shouted loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda said coldly, "Your child may not be lying and slandering, but you are." Valda continued, "I heard loud and clear what you said to Mr. Yeats that day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Wendy immediately gritted her teeth and then turned to Jason, saying, "Mr. Reed, please don't believe them. They are accusing me wrongly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Mr. Reed, we are actually relatives. You shouldn't trust outsiders over your own family," Yvo chimed in to support his wife's statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smirked and said, "I don't know when I became 'family' with you guys?" To him, his family only consisted of Grace and their four children. Everyone else was not considered family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as these words were spoken, Yvo and Wendy immediately looked embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, I heard that you and your spouse often use the name 'the Reed family' to gain advantages. There aren't many people in this world who can rely on their power, and unfortunately, you are not one of them," Jason said calmly. "If I hear you using the name 'the Reed family' again, it won't just be a matter of calling you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing these words, the couple Yvo's faces turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they didn't have the "Reed family relatives" relationship, who would give them face and sell them favors outside?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As for the art teacher's matter, I won't interfere. Just handle it however you see fit," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Yvo and Wendy finally breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed that Mr. Reed had no intention of supporting the other party.</p></div>
