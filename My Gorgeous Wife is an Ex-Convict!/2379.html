        <h1>Chapter 2377</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could think about was whether Amber Mitchell had gone insane and whether she was locked up in a mental hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was done washing up and changing her clothes, she was still slightly in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked out of the bathroom and saw Martin Weiss standing outside, obviously waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you done?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go and sit in the living room. I'll heat a glass of milk for you to drink before going to sleep. It&rsquo;ll make you feel better," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took her to the couch in the living room and handed her a glass of warm milk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took the glass and gazed blankly at the milk in it. Amber Mitchell had also secretly gotten milk for her to drink when she was pregnant back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said, "You need nutrition. I can't help with the rest, but there are ways to get milk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Plop. Plop!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tears unexpectedly gushed out of Kyla&rsquo;s eyes and down her cheeks. Pea-sized teardrops even fell into the glass of milk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly came to her senses and raised her hand to wipe away the tears, but the tears just kept streaming down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm sorry. I can't... I can't drink milk right now," sobbed Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked blankly at the woman full of tears. Her tears made him feel both heartache and jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because she never cried for me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But even so, it breaks my heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don't want to see her cry. Every tear she sheds is like an invisible needle puncturing my heart!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because you're worried about Amber Mitchell?" he asked in a murmur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I know I shouldn't be crying. Crying isn't good for the baby, but... I don't know if Amber Mitchell is really in a mental hospital or not. If she is, then... how long will it take to find her? Although... Although Grace's helping me, there are so many mental hospitals in the country. How long will the search take?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla sobbed, her tears gushing out harder!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's hand gently stroked her cheek that was stained with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so hot! The heat penetrated his skin, went into his blood, and spread throughout his limbs. It made him&hellip; uncomfortable! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He murmured, "What can I do for you to stop crying? If I send my men to help search Amber Mitchell too, will you stop crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked blankly at the face in front of her as she felt his fingers wipe the tears from her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will... Will you help search for Amber Mitchell?" She quickly asked and grabbed his hand after recovering her senses. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, if you stop crying." He gave her an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she stopped crying, he could send his people to search for Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears made him so uncomfortable! It turned out that even though he had forgotten his feelings for her, her tears still upset him.</p></div>
