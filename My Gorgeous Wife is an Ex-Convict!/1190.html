        <h1>Chapter 1189</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace got back to the ward to whisper the matter to Kyla Corbyn after finding out which police station Chase Harper was taken to. She said, "Kyla, I'm sorry. I was supposed to help Nelson discharge, but now, I have to go to the police station to find out what happened to Chase Harper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should go. My mother and I can handle the discharge procedure," Kyla Corbyn also said anxiously. Similarly, she did not believe Chase Harper would do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson did not know what was going on. He kept asking what &lsquo;detain&rsquo; was, and Kyla Corbyn could only muddle through by saying something else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was still being interrogated when Grace arrived at the police station. She learned from the police that there were witnesses and surveillance cameras on the scene. If they managed to find the surveillance footage and it was as what the victim and witness said, then Chase Harper would be charged with attempted rape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to see Chase Harper," said Grace. She wanted to meet Chase Harper no matter what and find out what happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's still being interrogated. If there's enough evidence, the police will detain him according to the laws and regulations. Visits are not allowed if they&rsquo;re not necessary," the policeman replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip and suddenly said, "I'm Chase Harper's lawyer. I have the right to see him!" With that, she took out her license and handed it to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The policeman examined it for a moment before saying, "You can see him when the interrogation is over, but only for half an hour."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay!" Grace answered and began to wait outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every minute and every second felt like she was sitting on pins and needles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door of an interrogation room was suddenly opened and out came a figure. She seemed to be crying and kept wiping her face with a tissue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Lindsay, you can go back first. We'll contact you later. You can also contact us anytime if you&rsquo;ve thought of any details!" someone said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay..." replied Stella. She saw Grace as soon as she turned her head and immediately said, "Grace, you're not going to plead for that man, are you? Let me tell you, I'll never forgive him for doing such a thing. It's a good thing someone walked by. If nobody was there, then I would've..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella sobbed at the end of her speech.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a tingling sensation on her scalp and had a bad presentiment. "So Chase Harper was detained by the police... because of you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's a rapist! How did you get a former colleague like that? You and him..." said Stella. Out of the corner of her eyes, she caught sight of the figure entering the police station and deliberately raised her voice as she said, "Did you say something to him that made him do such a terrible thing to me? Grace, we're cousins. How could you do this?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face was cold. Her intuition told her that something fishy was going on, and her cousin was throwing mud at her. "I still don't know what Chase Harper has done. Are you suffering from paranoia, thinking I want to harm you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you feel uncomfortable because I was Brian's childhood savior. Brian's nice to me, but he loves you. I can't take your place. You don't have to ask Chase Harper to do that." Stella began to sob.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never asked Chase Harper to do anything," Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, it doesn't matter if you admit it or not. It's just... I won't forgive Chase Harper no matter what." Stella took it upon herself to conclude the conversation.</p></div>
