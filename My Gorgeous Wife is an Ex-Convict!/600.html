        <h1>Chapter 599</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body suddenly shuddered. He turned to look at her in surprise. There was too much emotion in those dark, amorous eyes that she could not understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me talk to him, Jason," she said, holding his hand firmly as if to comfort him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at her without moving. His thin lips were pressed together tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was hesitating. He was hesitating because he did not know what to do. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a step forward and walked out from behind Jason. He did not stop her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at Brian who was a few steps away. "I'm not the one you're looking for. I have no impression of what you just said, so I think you've mistaken me for someone else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glistened as she spoke, while Brian's face looked incredulous. "That's impossible, you... Forgot, didn&rsquo;t you? Did you forget because it was so long ago?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've always had a good memory. I don't remember anything like what you just said ever happening. If I really do look like the little girl you remember and if the dress I chose today looks familiar, I can only say that it&rsquo;s all coincidence,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's thin lips were almost pursed in a straight line. His phoenix eyes were staring straight at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace met his eyes without flinching. After all, she was telling the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, Brian looked away. "I'll find out for myself whether or not you're her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he left the clothing shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always thought that she was not her, but today, when she put on the floral dress, he suddenly felt that it was her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was not her, why did she make him feel so strongly toward her? Why&hellip; Did they look so similar?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe he should have checked Grace out in the first place!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt as if Jason was holding her hand tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" said Grace as she looked up at Jason who was beside her. His expression was now full of solemnity. He was so grim that it was a little scary. "What's gotten into you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice snapped him out of his trance. Jason heaved a long sigh of relief. The seriousness and solemnity on his face gradually disappeared. "Nothing," he said. Then, he took a wad of money out of his wallet and gave it to the shop owner. "Take this as compensation for the loss here! I don't want a fourth person to know what happened here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shop owner took the money, and her eyes widened in surprise. Rather than calling it a loss, her shop only got a little messy where the chairs had fallen over. There was no real loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The money looked more like hush money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace's hand and got straight into the Bentley outside. The shop owner looked at the car as it sped away, then at the money in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Um... The three people who visited her shop today were probably not ordinary people. It seemed that she had better not say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Grace could not help exclaiming, "My electric bike is still parked over there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll get someone to take the electric bike back to the restaurant later," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Grace paused. "Where are you taking me now?" He was not driving in the direction of the small restaurant.</p></div>
