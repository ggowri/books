        <h1>Chapter 576</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">More and more people joined in. After all, no one liked to be played for a fool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for questioning the expert? It was quite the analysis, and that expert had nothing to do with Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's manager hurriedly called her and said, "Evelyn, the situation online is getting out of hand and some expert has pointed out that you did it on purpose. Why don't you ask Master Hart for help now? Otherwise, this won't end well later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn gritted her teeth in fury. She had seen the content online and had been in a good mood at first when everyone was criticizing Grace. That way, Jason would see the reports and it would be even better if trouble broke out between Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Brian had any ideas about Grace, it would not only embarrass Jason but also ruin his own reputation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for herself, she only had to play the victim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, who would have thought that out of the blue, an expert would pop up and waste time by making some model and analyzing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In particular, the expert was an authority figure on the subject; it was not the usual kind of "expert" who chased clout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn knew that everything she had at the moment was because of Brian; after becoming his girlfriend, her resources became more plentiful, and many more people became jealous of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she was in trouble, those who were jealous of her would only love to step on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was the only one who could help her clean up the mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn got ready to go out and look for Brian as she thought about it. However, when she opened the door of her apartment, she saw a man standing outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately recognized the person as one of Brian's men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Hart wants to see you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was delighted. Originally, her biggest concern was that Brian would not want to see her if she went to him. Now... Was Brian worried about her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he still had her in his heart, and he probably could not bear to see her suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, sure! I'll come with you to see him this instant," Evelyn responded with a face full of joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn got into the man&rsquo;s car and followed him to Brian's private residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Evelyn stepped into the living room, she saw on the big screen the surveillance video that had gone viral on the internet; the video which the leading expert had analyzed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This video... Evelyn immediately felt goosebumps all over her body, and an ineffable fear rose in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it not because... he wanted to help her, just like she had thought when he asked to see her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian..." said Evelyn, in a timid and aggrieved voice, "Why&hellip; Why are you watching this too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, can't I watch it?" Brian asked lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's not that!" said Evelyn hurriedly, "I... I'm just afraid that you'll misunderstand me after watching the video. Trust me. I wouldn&rsquo;t frame my sister or anything. I don't know how I fell that day... Maybe... I lost my footing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lost your footing?" Brian turned his head slightly, and his cold gaze rested on Evelyn's face. "Why don't you show me how you lost your footing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's face paled and reddened. "I'm your girlfriend, Brian. Don't you believe me? What's more, Grace is my sister. Why would I frame her? What would be in it for me to frame her?"</p></div>
