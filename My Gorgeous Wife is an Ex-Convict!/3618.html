        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two girls seemed pleased to hear this response, and the girl who spoke earlier immediately asked William, "Can we exchange WhatsApp numbers then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think there's a need for that," William declined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's face instantly turned awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, her friend said, "It's just exchanging WhatsApp numbers, let's get to know each other, become friends. My friend really likes you, you know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she said that, the girl's face turned even redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at the girl he had wanted to add on William's WhatsApp. She was quite cute, with fair skin and long hair that reached her shoulders. Her clothing also leaned towards a cute style.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Girls like her tend to easily attract boys and make them develop a liking for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, William replied, "Sorry, I don't want to be friends with your friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you like this? You don't even have a girlfriend!" the person said, then turned to Jasper and asked, "Are you his friend? Then you should persuade your friend. My friend really wants to be friends with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since he doesn't want to be friends with your friend, why are you forcing it?" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the person became unhappy. "What do you mean by that? Are you secretly </span><span>in love with him? Are you afraid that he will start liking my friend, so you don't want them to be friends?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper frowned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, William spoke up, saying, "It's not her secretly in love with me, it's me openly in love with her! I like her so much that if you continue to slander her, I won't be polite to you either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing these words, the person was left speechless, while the cute girl beside them blushed and hurriedly left, holding her friend's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at William and hesitated to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not interested in making friends with that person," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that girl, she's quite cute looking. Don't you guys, men, usually like that kind of cute type?" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she knew she wasn't bad-looking herself, her temperament was not that cute type. According to her roommate, she was more on the cold side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone who was unfamiliar with her judged her based on her appearance alone, they might feel that she's not easy to approach, like one of those high-class ladies, looking down on others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if someone truly knew her personality, they wouldn't feel that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't really think that girl just now was that cute," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what kind of girl do you think is cute?" she asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her with a helpless gaze, and in that instant, she felt like she had asked a silly question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze seemed to be telling her that, in his eyes, she was the cutest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper nervously licked her lips. "William, you said... you would wait for my answer, but what if, before I give you an answer, you happen to fall for another girl..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There won't be such a thing." he said with utmost certainty, "So you don't need to hurry to reply to me, you can take your time to consider."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she gave him a negative answer, he wouldn't fall in love with someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because in this world, he didn't think there was any woman who could make him fall in love again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words inexplicably gave her a sense of reassurance.</span></p></div>
