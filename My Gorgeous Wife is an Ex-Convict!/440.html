        <h1>Chapter 439</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Grace shouldn&rsquo;t have always tried to one up me in the past. Everyone took her as a hotshot in the law firm that they treated me like I was invisible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Now, I&rsquo;m going to make Grace &lsquo;famous&rsquo; again. I&rsquo;ll let everyone at the firm see how their best female lawyer is living her life now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll let them know how wrong they were in the past!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that this was the only way she could appease the anger in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a nurse walked past. That colleague asked the nurse. &ldquo;Earlier, one of your hospital staff said that regular patients can&rsquo;t go into that ultrasound room, but I saw a nurse leading someone into that room. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Oh, that should be our hospital&rsquo;s VIP package customer,&rdquo; the nurse replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;VIP package? How much does a VIP package cost?&rdquo; That colleague was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;That depends on the package chosen. The cheapest cost a few thousand while the expensive ones can go up to a few hundred thousand. If you want to find out more, you can head to the sixth floor. There is a special counter for this.&rdquo; The nurse then left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The colleague looked puzzled and turned to see Andrea who was equally shocked by what she heard from the nurse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Andrea, are you sure that the senior is only doing food delivery?&rdquo; The cheapest package already cost a few thousand bucks. It was not something a regular person could afford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;How is that possible!&rdquo; Andrea exclaimed as her face contorted. &ldquo;How can she be a VIP package customer!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t she enter that ultrasound room for her check-up?&rdquo; That colleague mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, some of the other colleagues from the firm looked over at Andrea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea realized that she had lost her poise. She tried to recompose herself before forcing out a smile to that colleague. &ldquo;There must be a misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside her heart, she could not help but wonder what was going on. &lsquo;How did Grace afford to buy the VIP package?! Where did she get the money!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the room, the radiologist was performing an ultrasound scan for Grace. When it was time to scan her uterus, the doctor frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Cummins, have you had a bad trauma to your abdomen before?&rdquo; the doctor asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s heart shuddered. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve received treatment for it back then. The doctor told me that my uterus suffered badly and the damage is irreversible.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, even if she were to take good care of her health and take medications to regulate her body, her body would never completely recover. Furthermore, she had been in prison. After getting out, she did not have the luxury to properly nourish herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Do you have children?&rdquo; the doctor suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No...&rdquo; Grace felt a sense of disappointment when she said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, the three years in prison brought her from heaven down to hell. The fact that she could not have children was like sending her to the deepest level of hell.</p></div>
