        <h1>Chapter 1793</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the expression on Brian&rsquo;s face, Dr. Russell could not help but sigh. "The operation was a success. It's the best I expected, but how well her hands can recover depends on the time period after this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Good." Brian smiled gently, which seemed to lift some of his loneliness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What mattered was that she was alright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How long will you be away from Emerald City?" asked Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I have no idea. It depends on the project over there. Maybe I'll be back in six months. Maybe three to five years," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell said nothing more. Brian got up. "I'll visit you in the clinic when I come back. Goodbye!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The tall figure made his way out of the lounge, and Dr. Russell muttered, "I wonder when this boy will get over Lil Cummins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian went to the parking lot and was about to get in his car when he suddenly stopped. Jason was standing in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Why aren&rsquo;t you accompanying Grace in the hospital ward but are here blocking me instead?" Brian asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said lightly, "Grace is still under anesthesia and will not wake up for more than an hour. Why did you hide from everyone that you&rsquo;re here in the hospital?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you want Grace to know that I was waiting outside during her operation?" Brian asked in amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Your flight is at eight o'clock tonight. Are you going to the airport now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You&rsquo;re well aware. Yes, I'm going to the airport." Brian did not seem surprised that Jason knew the time of his flight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As Brian spoke, he walked to the car door, opened it, and got into the driver's seat. Just as he was about to close the door, Jason suddenly pressed his hand on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why didn't you tell Grace what happened back then?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not bring up the details, but Brian knew exactly what he was talking about. "I didn't say it for Grace's sake. If you don't want her to know how despicable you are, you'd better hide that incident for the rest of your life. She's upright and righteous. She won&rsquo;t be able to accept your dark side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason leaned over and stared at Brian coldly. "You don't have to worry about that. Grace is my wife in this life and will still be my wife in the next one. Brian, you'd better remember that she will never be with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, Jason closed the car door and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian glanced lightly at Jason's back and started his car to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Maybe... not in this life, but who knows... about the next? If there really is a next life, I hope I can meet Grace earlier. We won't be separated anymore, and I can grow old with Grace...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina sent Kyla back to the store. Kyla asked her to stay for dinner. Fortunately, the baby in Lina&rsquo;s stomach behaved during dinner and did not make her throw up again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Lina headed home, Kyla said, "Drive carefully. You're not alone anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Got it," said Lina. She drove back home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as she got back to her house, the space full of boxes... caught her attention.</p></div>
