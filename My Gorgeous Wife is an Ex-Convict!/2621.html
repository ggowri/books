        <h1>Chapter 2619</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, why don't we..." Camille Strickland wanted to propose that they ditched the blind date and go home first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had witnessed how Raymond Bowman had hurt Valda. She would be hurting Valda if she let her sit down for a meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before Camille Strickland could finish, Valda Theller said, "Camille, let's have a seat first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller gave her best friend an assuring look as she quietly squeezed her hand, implying that it was fine. She also pulled her best friend and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ordering the food, Camille Strickland pulled Valda Theller away from the dining table with the excuse of going to the washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, you don't have to worry about me. I didn't know that Keith Sharp was friends with Raymond Bowman. If I had known..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller interposed, "You wouldn't have asked me to come. But it doesn't matter. Raymond Bowman hurt me, but won&rsquo;t it mean that I still care about the past if I keep avoiding him? Camille, I don't want to avoid him. Besides, Raymond Bowman isn't worth me running away from, is he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland suddenly realized that her best friend was stronger than she imagined. Her eyes were clear and honest. It seemed that Valda had really gotten over the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, he's not worth it." Camille Strickland smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, at the dining table, Keith Sharp looked at Raymond Bowman and said hesitantly, "Mr. Bowman, did you already know that they were the ones coming today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Keith Sharp somehow had that feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman was not his friend but a CEO his company had suddenly sent over. It was said that he was going to join the headquarters' board of directors, and the branch was only a stepping stone for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman had seen a photo of Camille Strickland on his phone by chance and chatted with him. Then, he asked him to ask her to bring another friend after the chat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was confused at the time, but he dared not refuse due to the man&rsquo;s identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene earlier made him think that Raymond Bowman had already guessed that Valda Theller would be the one Camille Strickland would bring. It was as if he had anticipated everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman smiled. "Regardless, I'm your friend. I'm only here to accompany you on your blind date, aren't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced in the direction of the washroom as he said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After so many years, he finally saw Valda again, but... he thought that perhaps she would turn to leave without saying anything after seeing him. However, she sat down calmly without the fascination she used to have when she looked at him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After dinner, Keith Sharp tried hard to lighten the mood in the process, but it was still weird.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille told me that you're a comic artist. I wonder what kind of comics you draw? I'd like to read them if I have the chance," said Keith Sharp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're romance comics. You can ask Camille for the details. She&rsquo;s in charge of my editing and knows my comics best. But such comics might not be your cup of tea," Valda Theller said with a smile.</p></div>
