        <h1>Chapter 3921</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where is this place?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's my villa. You look terrible right now. Do you really think that leaving you in a crowded place won't cause any misunderstandings?" Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy lowered her head, fidgeting with her clothes anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her current state, it was indeed quite messy. She was soaked and her eyes were swollen from crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Mick's luxury car really drove to the bustling city and let her out, her appearance would be enough to cause others to speculate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry...I didn't expect this," Nancy said softly. "And thank you for saving me today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, she might have really been hit by a car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did something happen to you?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Usually, he rarely showed any curiosity about other people's affairs, but at this moment, he couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, in his impression, Nancy should be strong. Even after being slapped twice, she still looked calm, as if those two slaps and her so-called sister's harsh words were nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So what exactly happened that made her walk in the middle of the road in such a distraught state, even crying in his arms?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just something...unfortunate," Nancy said nasally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you break up with someone?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," she had never even been in a relationship, let alone a breakup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, if it was just a breakup, that would be fine. At least her mother was still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My mother passed away," she said softly. "I just buried her today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was stunned, and the car fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was taken aback to learn that the woman in front of him had just experienced the pain of losing a loved one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, he didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just looked at her sitting next to him, her slender body looking so fragile, and because she was looking down, he could see her delicate white neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking so fragile, as if someone could easily twist her neck with a gentle squeeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fragility emanating from her entire being made people unconsciously feel pity for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pity?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When this word flashed through Mick's mind, he immediately mocked himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was there a time when he felt pity for someone with whom he had no blood relation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because of the scene where she was slapped before, which left a deep impression on him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car arrived at Mick's villa, and Nancy got out of the car with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick asked the servant to take Nancy to bathe and prepare clean clothes for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Nancy immersed herself in the warm water, she finally began to calm down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She never expected to be brought to Mick's villa, let alone take a bath here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was someone Clarissa couldn't get close to, but today, Nancy was so close to him, even crying in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy raised her hands and looked at them, the same hands that had held Mick tightly not long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What's even more unbelievable is that Mick didn't push her away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this thought, an idea suddenly came to Nancy's mind!</p></div>
