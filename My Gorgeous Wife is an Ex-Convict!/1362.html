        <h1>Chapter 1361</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she saw his face every day, she was still amazed by his appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strangely enough, she did not feel the same way when she saw good-looking male celebrities. Even the handsome faces those female fans said were masterpieces created by God, she merely appreciated their looks. She would be amazed for a moment, but that was all it was after she kept looking at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, with Jay, she could not seem to get enough of his looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good morning. Happy birthday!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled. "Good morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to go to the office today, do you?" she asked as she watched him take his clothes out of the closet and put them on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time she watched him put on his clothes, she felt as though she was watching a movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though they were husband and wife who had seen everything about the other, she could not help but blush in the face of such &lsquo;scenery&rsquo;. However, she could not help looking on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He enjoyed her looking at him this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, do you think our kids will look like you?" she could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slipped on his shirt and buttoned it as he said, "What's the matter? Do you want our kids to look like me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." She nodded. "It's good if they could look like you. I wonder how many women the boys will attract. If they're girls... Um... Maybe a bunch of men will fight to their deaths for them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said lightly, "I hope the kids look like you. Whether they're boys or girls, I want them all to look like you." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quipped, "Me? Don't you think they&rsquo;ll be getting the short end of the stick if they look like me and didn't inherit your beautiful looks?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Beautiful?" he muttered. He walked over to the bedside and leaned in, putting his hands on the edge of the bed as he stared at her. "You're the most beautiful person to me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face could not help turning red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the most lethal tactic when a man who was more beautiful than you said sweet nothings as though inadvertently!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... You..." She stared at him with her almond-shaped eyes wide open, not knowing what to say all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chuckled and kissed her crimson cheeks. Then, he looked serious again. "They can look like me too, but I don't want the kids to have my eyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked into his eyes and knew it was because they looked like his mother's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, those eyes had become the feature he hated the most about himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she found his eyes extremely beautiful. She was the most attracted to them because she could always see his tenderness and love for her in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She whispered, "I... love your eyes, Jay. To me, these eyes don't look like anyone else's eyes but are uniquely yours. I love the way you look at me with those eyes and the way they carry traces of your smile. They're really beautiful to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Unique?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, it's your birthday today. Cheer up a little. If any of the kids have eyes like yours, you can't dislike them!" She made a statement in passing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not help smiling when he heard this. It was as if her words had taken away a great deal of the dislike he had for his eyes. "Okay. They're our kids, so I won't dislike them!"</p></div>
