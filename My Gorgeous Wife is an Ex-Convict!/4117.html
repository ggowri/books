        <h1>Chapter 4115</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to have the baby soon, but why did she still feel a hint of unease?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because Chandler was too selfless in his feelings for her? He always put the choice in front of her, as if he could accept it whether she wanted him or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this made her confused about his feelings for her, and she couldn't figure out how much he really cared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at the film and television city, Tina and Eugenia strolled around, and Eugenia took out the guide she made online. After all, you could find out which filming crews were in the film and television city with a little effort online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, not everyone can manage to do this "put in some effort".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Take Eugenia for example, she has around 10 fan groups at her fingertips. She filters out all the information, big and small, and combines it with news and posts she finds online to determine that there are three crews filming in the film and television city today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although visitors are not allowed to approach the filming location of the crew, it's still nice to take a distant look at the filming scene. What's more important is that, with permission, you can get closer when the actors are on break!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unfortunately, Kit's crew isn't filming here today. They were here a few days ago, but not today...sigh!" Eugenia expressed her regret. Although she is a fan, she is not so obsessed that she would skip school to come and see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina, on the other hand, is relieved that Kit's crew isn't here. Otherwise, how would she face Kit?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The online gossip is so lively that many people directly assume that she is pregnant with Kit's child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Speaking of which, this gossip has had quite an impact on Kit's reputation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For stars like Kit, even if the scandal is unfounded, it still has a negative impact on them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina has decided that if this scandal causes Kit to lose any endorsements or advertisements, she will have Kit come and do an advertisement and endorsement for White Maple Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Kit is already good-looking and has many fans. Moreover, he is involved in this scandal because of her, so her father should agree, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Tina has forgotten to consider that if Kit really does an advertisement and endorsement for White Maple Group, there may be more scandals in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if Kit's crew isn't filming here, we can still watch other crews filming, right?" Tina is still interested in watching crews filming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When her mother was a fan, she took Tina to the set before, of course, with her father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But because her father was there, everyone on the set was nervous, even her mother's idol, who was trembling and calling them "Mr. Stephenson, Mrs. Stephenson..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So later on, her mother didn't go to the set much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, that crew over there, it seems to be...Kit's crew! I see several actors who are part of his crew!" Eugenia's voice suddenly brought Tina back from her daydream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't you say his crew wasn't filming at the studio today?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's what the information online said, but...looking at it now, it should be his crew from 'The Game of Thrones'," Eugenia pointed to the left.</p></div>
