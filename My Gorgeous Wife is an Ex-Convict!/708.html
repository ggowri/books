        <h1>Chapter 707</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this really Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;The woman I once trampled on?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Feeling better?" Jason asked with concern as if her presence was all that remained in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt the cold in her hands getting warmer and warmer as he breathed on them, the pain in her fingers fading away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Much better," she said with a sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her face which indeed appeared a little better than before. "Looks like I'll have to get the doctor to examine your hands again. They're not cured at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're actually a lot better. Maybe it was just a psychological reaction that caused my hands to throb," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So it's because of Sean and Lily? Did your hands hurt because they almost destroyed your hands once?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked, then lowered her eyes again. 'Yes, he must&rsquo;ve investigated me when he approached me. How could he not know that my hands were almost destroyed?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I get justice for you?" muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Get justice? How is he going to get it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips parted, saying, "I&rsquo;ll let them suffer twice as much as the pain they had caused you, of course. What about ripping out their nails, tearing their hamstrings, and breaking their bones?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such brutal words came out of his mouth as calmly as if they meant nothing to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Revenge? He would let them suffer for how they made her suffer!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes could not help turning toward Sean and Lily who were not far away. They were looking this way too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The eyes of the three met in mid-air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, are you going to make them suffer?" Jason's voice rang in her ears again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head and stared blankly at the man in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, she only felt that if she nodded, Jason was sure to keep his word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean and Lily would surely end up worse than she had!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I don't want justice in that way," Grace said as she shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No?" Jason's eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I don't want to be like them. If I do the same thing they did to me, what's the difference between me and them?" Grace said as she turned and held Jason's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands were good-looking, slender, and defined. Even his fingernails were beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The first time she saw his hands, she thought they were clean as if they were free from the filth of the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although after learning that he was Jason, she knew that his hands might not be as clean as she thought they were. She... "I don't want you to get your hands dirty because of me, Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was stunned. After a moment, he said in a hoarse voice, "What if... I don't care?" His hands were already dirty and stained with blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I do." Grace looked solemnly at Jason. "Therefore, you don't have to get justice for me, Jay. One day when I'm strong enough, I won't have to do anything to make them regret what they did to me."</p></div>
