        <h1>Chapter 212</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's role today as an extra was to be a servant girl. All she had to do was to stand where the director wanted her to stand and keep her head low. There was a whole group of servant girls. They had to wait for the main characters to pass by them and kneel as directed by the director. Then, they had to grovel and say, &lsquo;We wish you happiness and peace, Master and Madam.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As this was a kneeling scene, she would get extra money&mdash;50 dollars more, so 130 dollars in total.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll just kneel then. It's only a scene anyway. Even a famous star will have kneeling scenes. Besides, most of the time, when survival is a problem, the knees aren&rsquo;t as important,&rsquo; thought Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The extras' makeup room was huge. There were several makeup artists as well as male and female extras in the room, all waiting for the makeup artists to apply their makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The makeup artists worked very fast. One's makeup could be done in only five to six minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was Grace's turn, the makeup artist was surprised. "You have a scar on your forehead!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shivered for a little and answered her. It was on her forehead near the scalp, so no one could see it if they did not look closely. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a wound inflicted in prison that was not taken care of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew why the makeup artist mentioned it. It was because all the servant girls had to comb their bangs flat today. The scar would then be visible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it matter? Can I still act as a servant girl?" she asked nervously. At first, she had been worried about Lily spiting her. Now, she was worried if she could keep her job as an extra.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right, we&rsquo;ll just cover it with a little bit of powder," the makeup artist said and quickly finished Grace's makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked in the mirror and sure enough, she could not see her scar anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she stepped out of the huge room and waited for her turn, she saw a familiar figure coming her way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not Lily, but Evelyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She did not expect that other than Lily, Evelyn was also part of the cast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn looked like a diva who was being followed by several assistants. One was holding an umbrella; one holding her bag; one reading Evelyn her lines for today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn paused in her steps and looked at her. At first, she was stunned. Then, a smile came over her lips as she walked up to Grace. "Why, are you here as an extra today?" Evelyn asked knowingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was dressed as a servant girl in the film, and her costume revealed everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Evelyn, somewhat surprised. The Evelyn now was no longer a small C-lister. She looked as if she was an A-lister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn had not changed into her costume. Looking at the fancy branded clothes and jewelry she was wearing, they were probably worth millions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not think that Evelyn would use knockoff goods. After all, her younger sister was the proudest. If someone found her using knockoff goods, the humiliation was similar to taking Evelyn's life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace did not hide and responded with poise.</p></div>
