        <h1>Chapter 4318 Meeting Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finally got the chance to see him. It was a moment I had been eagerly waiting for, and my heart was racing with excitement. He was everything I had imagined and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I walked towards him, my mind was filled with a million thoughts. Would he like me? Would he even remember me? It had been so long since we last spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as our eyes met, all my doubts disappeared. I could see the same spark in his eyes that I had felt all those years ago. It was like no time had passed between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We hugged each other tightly, and I could feel his warmth and hear his steady heartbeat. It was a feeling I never wanted to let go of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We spent the whole day catching up, reminiscing about old times, and making new memories. It was like we were back in our carefree days, with no worries or responsibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the day came to an end, we promised to stay in touch and not let so much time pass between us again. I knew that no matter where life took us, our bond would always remain strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meeting him was a reminder of how precious true friendship is. And I was grateful to have him in my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina suddenly opened her arms and hugged Chandler, burying her face deeply in his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the feeling of being embraced finally gave Tina a sense of reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's not a dream, it's real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really saw Chandler again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you want to join the Quentin family?" Chandler's voice sounded low and deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to stop you, the Quentin family is using you to lure out the Gu worms. It's too risky, you don't need to take such a risk to lure out the Gu worms!" Tina raised her head and looked at Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The size of the risk, big or small, is my concern and has nothing to do with you," Chandler said indifferently. "Also, can you let go of my hand now? We are not in a relationship where we can hug like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina nibbled her lip and said, "I don't think we're in a relationship where we can't hug each other. We're still husband and wife, isn't it natural for a wife to hug her husband? And besides, you're my husband, how could your problems not concern me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the moment the divorce agreement was signed, it was already the end of our marriage for me," said Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry!" Tina suddenly spoke up, "I was too impulsive back then. I shouldn't have thought that you were deceiving me, and I didn't even try to understand things from your perspective. You did everything you could! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina kept apologizing, but Chandler remained indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back, you promised the Quentin family's conditions. I've already talked to them and we can pretend it was never brought up!" Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's body stiffened suddenly: "I'm not going back! If I have to go back, then you're coming with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she tightly grasped his clothes, determined to stay by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Tina like this, Chandler couldn't help but sigh: "I will lure out the Gu worm here, and with the Quentin family, the risk is not as big as you think. So you can rest assured, this is good for both you and me! You don't want us to have another child without love, just for the sake of curing me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Tina exclaimed quickly. "It's not that there is no love. I love you, Chandler. You love me too. So between us, there is love. But because of the child we had together, if that child knew about its birth, it could help relieve your pain. I believe it would also bring joy to him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Chandler looked at Tina with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't do this out of pity for you, don't even say that. I know that I love you, just like how Tina used to love you!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really sure that your feelings for me are love? After losing your memory, we've only spent a little time together. Are you sure that in such a short time, you can fall in love with me again? And even after finding out that I deceived you, if it wasn't for seeing me suffer from the pain of my curse, I can't think of any other reason why you would pity me." Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is it impossible to fall in love? Sometimes, falling in love with someone only takes a moment, right?" Tina said. "Do I have to regain my past memories for you to believe that I love you?"</span></p></div>
