        <h1>Chapter 2501</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some love turned out to be so painful and so difficult!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Jason took Grace to tMason Swansonty's best maternity hospital for a check-up. Kyla was also admitted to the same hospital for her pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've been coming to this hospital a lot lately." Grace could not help saying with a sigh. "Let's go visit Kyla later after I'm done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace underwent a series of tests in the hospital and was told that the baby already had a heartbeat when she did the ultrasound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes reddened instantly. 'The baby's heartbeat! That means the baby in my belly truly exists.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After coming out of the ultrasound room, Grace put a hand on her belly, her eyes reddening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason quickly walked forward and said, "What's wrong? Did you just cry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sniffed. "The baby already has a heartbeat. It's one baby. The doctor says the baby's statistics are good so far."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did the doctor say you're in good shape to have a baby?" he quickly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The ultrasound is only to check the baby's condition. We need to evaluate all other aspects to know whether I'm capable of carrying the child," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew he would not have asked such a silly question under normal circumstances. He had just become muddle-headed due to his concern. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two went to the consultation room again. The doctor in charge of overseeing Grace&rsquo;s case was a highly respected obstetrics and gynecology specialist in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Judging from the current situation, everything's fine. It's just that your uterus was injured before, and it was also damaged when you were pregnant with your triplets. We don't know whether your body will be able to provide adequate nutrition to the baby yet. We also have to wait until the baby is older to see if the placenta is attached to the C-section's incision. It could be dangerous if it is, and we would recommend you terminate the pregnancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor cited two potential risks and said, "We need to see your other test results before making a final decision. Those reports should come out in a week."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was worried as they left the hospital, and Grace asked, "What's wrong? The doctor said we have to wait and see. Besides, the baby hasn't grown its placenta. What if the placenta is alright? Then there's no danger at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her finger was pressed against his lips. "Jay, I promise I won't bet my life on this because I know it's not just my life I'm betting on but yours too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want this baby?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were full of reluctance. "I'm reluctant to give the baby up, so I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to save this little life. But if it comes to the last resort, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out it was difficult to utter some things. It turned out that some things were uncomfortable just thinking about them.</p></div>
