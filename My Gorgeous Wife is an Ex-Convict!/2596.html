        <h1>Chapter 2594</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly came to her senses. Taking a deep breath, she suppressed the tension in her heart. "I came to you... to talk about the divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said indifferently, &ldquo;You're dissatisfied with the terms I made, and I've asked my lawyer to tell you that I&rsquo;ll accept whatever suggestion you have as long as I can fulfill it. If you just want to talk to me about this, you can talk to my lawyer! It's no different than talking to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he turned around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's a difference!" Kyla ran forward and held Martin Weiss's hand. "I don't want a divorce. I don't want to sign the divorce agreement."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss froze instantly. He turned around and looked at Kyla with shock. "You don't want a divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she answered affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were dark. Moments later, he sneered. "In that case, do you want to continue being Mrs. Weiss for a while more? What is it about this time? Last time, you wanted to be Mrs. Weiss because you didn't want your child to be born a bastard. This time, do you want to stay married for a while more because the baby will be discriminated against if her parents are divorced?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla widened her eyes and looked at Martin Weiss in disbelief. She never expected him to think that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then when are you planning on getting divorced? Two years? Three years? Five years? Ten years?" He looked at her as if amused. Then, he said, "Kyla, I have no interest in playing such marriage games with you. You can suggest any terms for the divorce, but there's no way we're not getting a divorce!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they stayed married, she would only erode his life further. Perhaps he would have a mental breakdown one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly explained, "It's... It's not like that! Martin Weiss, I don't want a divorce because... I love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finally said these three words to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those three long-lost words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had often said these three words to him when they were younger but stopped afterward. She thought she would never say those words to him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because they were unsuitable for each other. With all the enmity they had, maybe splitting up was the best choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she said it now. She revealed her true feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You love me?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "Yes, I love you. Martin Weiss, I love you. I don't want to divorce you, and it's not about the kids. I just want to spend the rest of my life with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You love me?" He suddenly laughed. "Kyla, did you say you love me? If I remember correctly, it was only less than half a year ago when you said you wanted me to stop bothering you and break up with me for good. We were at the hospital then. I begged you to give me a chance to start over. But you said you didn't love me, didn&rsquo;t you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words poked her heart like a sharp sword.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes... I did say that. I didn't recognize my feelings at the time," Kyla admitted.</p></div>
