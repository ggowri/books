        <h1>Chapter 1474</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, great changes had taken place outside these days. The Atkinson family had a capital chain rupture and could not pay their bank loan, so the bank applied to the court to freeze a number of the Atkinson family's properties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Meanwhile, the media exposed that the police had arrested Lily at a fan meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Lily had retired from the film industry, she still had many die-hard fans. Lily had dressed up for the fan meeting, wearing a necklace worth 30 million dollars. She had even invited some journalists over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily's original intention for holding a fan meeting was to show that the Atkinson family was not in a financial crisis and to get her name to the trending online topics. However, the police showed up at her fan meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In other words, she was handcuffed in front of a crowd of fans by police who said they were arresting her as a murder suspect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Those fans were dumbfounded. 'Murder? What murder? Is our Goddess Atkinson a murder suspect?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With a situation like this, there was no way to cover it up even if Lily and the Atkinson family wanted to. After all, there were so many fans there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, the incident immediately topped the online trending topics, causing a stir in public opinion. Later, some people exposed online that the case Lily was involved in was related to Jennifer's car accident!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In other words, Lily was the culprit behind Jennifer's death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The public was in an uproar when the news came out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, when Jennifer died, there had been photos and news of how broken-hearted and sad Lily was. Besides, Lily had also expressed that she missed her sister more than once on various variety shows. She had even written short essays online in memory of her sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everyone had thought of her as such an affectionate sister!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now... she was the suspect in Jennifer's murder?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That meant Lily had played the public for fools!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although the police had not made an announcement, netizens were already scolding Lily and the Atkinson family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Someone even flooded Stevens Group's official Twitter account with rebukes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean was scrolling through the contents on his phone with an indescribable expression on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He never thought that Jennifer's death was plotted by Lily! The police had conclusive evidence, and Lily had also admitted to her crimes in her statement!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Unlike ordinary netizens who could only speculate online, Sean immediately went to the police station and met Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he asked her why she did it and what was the deep grudge she had toward her own sister, the woman he loved smiled sinisterly and said...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sis was too lucky. My parents were devoted to training her to be their heir. I'm no less capable than Sis, but they chose her! What's more, Sis also became Jason's fianc&eacute;e! All the glory went to her. Did anyone ever notice me?"</p></div>
