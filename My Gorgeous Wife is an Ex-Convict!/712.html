        <h1>Chapter 711</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason led Grace forward, and Martin Weiss could not help being a little surprised to see the two of them. "We meet again. I never thought Young Master Reed would be interested in fairs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came here to meet Lawyer Bailey today," said Jason. Then, he turned to Jewel Bailey and said, "Hello, Lawyer Bailey. I'm Jason, and this is my fianc&eacute;e, Grace. She's been dying to meet you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Meet me?" Jewel Bailey was shocked when Jason told her his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason! Is this the so-called local tyrant of Emerald City? He's someone you can't offend in Emerald City.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was younger and more charismatic than she had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, her eyes fell on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she wanted to come to Emerald City, she had also followed Emerald City's news. These days, the reversal of a case from nearly four years ago was not only viral in the tabloids but also among the lawyers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you," Jewel Bailey said to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned, then she realized that Jewel Bailey must have known about her case!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jewel Bailey, who was about 40 years old, wore a navy blue formal suit instead of a gown, but it set off her disposition well and made her look capable as well as elegant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Lawyer Bailey. You were my idol during my schooling days. Nice to meet you," Grace said, then she laughed in self-mockery. "You probably know me because of my case."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, your case is a hot topic among the lawyers recently. However, I didn't expect to meet you in person today and to hear that I was your idol in your schooling days," said Jewel Bailey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There were a lot of girls in my class who wanted to be a lawyer like Lawyer Bailey." After all, there were few famous female lawyers in the legal profession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little excited, but after all, she had experienced so many things that she was unlikely to pursue her idol in the same way as youngsters did. "I hope I can ask you some legal questions in the future if you don't mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you trying to become a lawyer again?" asked Jewel Bailey as she looked directly at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. I want to be a lawyer again. After all, it's what I love to do," answered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You still love it?" Jewel Bailey smiled slightly. "If your defense lawyer had been more careful and attentive, they would&rsquo;ve found something wrong in the case three years ago and you wouldn't have spent three years in prison for nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's what I've been through that makes me love it even more. I hope I can help people like me to get to the bottom of their case and clear their name through the law," said Grace as she met her gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jewel Bailey scrutinized the woman in front of her. She was different from what she had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid that Mr. Reed played a big role in getting the case reversed so quickly. Not everyone can be so lucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's why we need lawyers all the more, right?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jewel Bailey smiled, but this smile was much more cordial than the smile earlier. "I'll be opening my law firm in Emerald City sometime soon, and if Miss Cummins is interested in discussing legal issues with me, you're welcome there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was thrilled. "Sure, I'll be there for sure!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, Miss Cummins, how's the little boy from last time? He didn't lose his hearing aid again, did he?" asked Martin Weiss who was beside them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened slightly and looked at him with somewhat mixed feelings. "That child has only met Mr. Weiss once. I didn't expect Mr. Weiss to be concerned."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Nelson lost his hearing aid and happened to meet Martin Weiss, Martin Weiss seemed pretty kind to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the man did not know that the deaf child was his son and that he had been born in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla tried every means to avoid Martin Weiss, probably for Nelson's sake.</p></div>
