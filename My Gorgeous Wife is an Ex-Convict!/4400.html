        <h1>Chapter 4398: Go Find Him</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two years, he finally sorted out his feelings. That's why he came back, wanting to start over with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was him who lost her in the first place, then now he's going to personally bring her back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, but I don't like you anymore. My feelings for you ended two years ago." After Harley said this, he firmly pulled his hand away from Lornell's and quickly turned to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, the only thought in her mind was to find Calvert. She absolutely couldn't let anything happen that she would regret!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell watched Harley's retreating figure, unconsciously clenching his fist. Why... why did she have to go?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that she's really fallen for Calvert? She's liked him for so many years, but now... she feels nothing?!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't accept </span><span>it,</span><span> how could he possibly accept it!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, this time he's back, he's determined to win her love again!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley </span><span>drove</span><span> quickly to the location he had asked about.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This restaurant operates on a membership basis. Most of the people who come here are either rich or influential, and naturally, it's also frequented by quite a few celebrities.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the big princess of the entertainment industry, Harley naturally attracted a lot of attention as soon as she stepped in here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people are even speculating about why this Grand Princess is here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Hart, what brings you here today?" The manager hurriedly greeted her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which room is Calvert in?" Harley asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This..." The manager seemed to hesitate for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert, being a popular newcomer, was naturally someone he knew. Not to mention, he was also </span><span>well aware</span><span> of Miss. Maldonado, who was dining with Calvert today. And the private dining room they were in...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spit it out!" Harley could tell by the manager's expression that he </span><span>definitely knew</span><span> something. "If you don't start talking, this restaurant might not be open for business tomorrow! The police might even come looking for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's... it's in the special private room on the third floor, room 303," the manager said hurriedly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A private room? Harley's eyebrows furrowed. She knew all too well what the private rooms in this restaurant were used for. But if others were willing participants, she naturally wouldn't interfere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, it involves Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Harley hurriedly dashed towards the third floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she burst into booth 303, only Calvert's agent was sitting by the dining table, with no one else around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Harley, the agent was clearly taken aback, his face full of surprise and unease. "</span><span>....Miss</span><span> Hart, what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Calvert?" Harley asked, staring at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm not sure. After he finished his meal, he... he just left," the agent said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But out of the corner of her eye, Harley spotted Calvert's phone sitting on the dining table. She could recognize his phone </span><span>at a glance</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it was her who chose this phone case for him!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert wouldn't just leave without his phone. If he did leave it behind, it's too much of a coincidence that it's turned off!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Harley</span><span> looked around the private room. Although she had never been in such a special room before, she knew that there was a hidden door in it, leading to a secret chamber used for private rendezvous!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the manager also hurriedly rushed in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley grabbed the manager, "Where's the secret door?!"</span></p></div>
