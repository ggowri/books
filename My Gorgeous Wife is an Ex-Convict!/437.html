        <h1>Chapter 436</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even without taking into consideration his identity, his looks alone were enough for women to line up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her answer set off a flash of disappointment in his eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel jealous?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Jealous?&rdquo; She was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was staring at her as if he wanted to see through her. After some time, it was as if he finally accepted a certain reality and sighed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re heartless. I would&rsquo;ve been happy if you said that you&rsquo;re jealous.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lower lip. &lsquo;Jealous?... Earlier when that woman called Judy Dixon approached Jason while looking like she&rsquo;d have no problem winning him over, was I jealous? She even looked at me with eyes full of disdain...&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know the answer to that either. It was as if at that moment, she did not think about jealousy. She just knew that Jason would not accept that woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because she believed that... Jason was hers? Her trust toward Jason had unknowingly... grown so much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That thought made Grace secretly shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Grace, when will you be jealous because of me? Let me see that you care about me...&rdquo; He bent his waist and caressed her cheek with his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he was the only one in the relationship who would feel jealous... That was not right. It was as if this relationship was filled with inequality, like only his emotions would be affected by her and not the other way around as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, perhaps there was no fairness when it came to a romantic relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps... there would always be one who loved deeply while the other less...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace remained silent. She did not know how to answer him. If one day she felt jealous because of him, would that mean that she... no longer trusted him as much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had arranged for a health checkup for Grace the next day. That night, she went to bed early. The next morning, she saw Jason holding the clothes and shoes he bought for her yesterday. He said to her, &ldquo;Wear this. I&rsquo;ve asked the helpers to wash them already.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;He&rsquo;s so efficient.&rsquo; Grace was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The clothes that Jason brought for her was a set of casual clothes that were easy to wear and remove, suitable for today&rsquo;s purpose of going for a health checkup. As for the shoes, it was a pair of casual shoes that did not have any shoelaces. She just needed to slip them on and off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked by Jason&rsquo;s thoughtful behavior. It was obvious that he had not randomly picked a set of clothes from those she bought yesterday. He had given it some thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the clothes and went to the bathroom to wash up and change before she put on the shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she came out of the bathroom, Jason was staring at her, mesmerized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Is there something wrong?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Nothing. It&rsquo;s just rare to see you dressed like this.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked down at her clothes. &ldquo;I used to dress like this back in university.&rdquo; In university, she liked to dress casually as she felt more at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she started working, she had to dress in work attire most of the time due to the dress code. During her free time, she would go on dates with Sean. Sean did not like her to dress so casually, thus she seldom wore this style of clothes anymore.</p></div>
