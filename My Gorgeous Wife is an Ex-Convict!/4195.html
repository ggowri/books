        <h1>Chapter 4193 If I'm Not the One You Love</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina shuddered and immediately became nervous. "Who is it?!" she shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because it was a hotel bathroom, it had opaque glass as a barrier, so her voice easily carried outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's me," Kit's voice came through, and then he said to Tina, "I put the clothes you need to change into on the washbasin over here. You can take them in and wear them yourself later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina immediately felt relieved. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After she finished washing up, she changed into the clean clothes that Kit had bought for her. Surprisingly, they fit her well and they were even maternity clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina pushed open the glass door from the sink and saw Kit sitting on the sofa. On the coffee table in front of the sofa, there were a lot of fruits, snacks, and milk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Obviously, he had just bought them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Now that you're pregnant, you need to eat more and replenish your nutrition, you know? You've become too thin compared to before," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Now, apart from her large belly, her limbs looked extremely slender, as if she would collapse with a gust of wind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He could imagine what her eating conditions would be like in that village. She probably couldn't eat well at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Thank you," Tina said. She really needed to supplement her nutrition now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A complicated light flashed in Kit's eyes. "Tina, you don't need to thank me at all. I just hope that in the future... you won't dislike me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why would I dislike you?" Tina smiled and said, "You're so good to me, I can't help but like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her smile deepened the guilt in his heart. "In the future, even if I do something wrong, would you still forgive me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What could you possibly do wrong?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit's smile became even more bitter. "Just... hypothetically speaking, I'm afraid that if I really do something wrong in the future, you won't forgive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No, I will definitely forgive you," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> His heart started to leap with joy. As long as she was willing to forgive him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But her next words made his body turn ice-cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She said, "Because you're the father of the child, and you're the person I love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She said it so naturally, but it made his heart sink into an abyss with no bottom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's wrong? You look pale," Tina said. "Did I say something wrong just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No," he quickly said, "Maybe I'm just a bit tired. Resting for a while will be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Then have a good rest tonight," Tina said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit stood up and suddenly hugged Tina. "Tina, what if I'm not the person you love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because the father of the child in her belly, as well as the person she loved, was Chandler!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Are you worried that I have no memory and won't fall in love with you again?" Tina obviously misunderstood the meaning of Kit's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He remained silent, not saying a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Thinking that she had guessed correctly, she raised her hand and hugged him from behind, burying her face in his chest. "No, I believe that you're someone I have loved before, and I will definitely fall in love with you again, just like the song you sang for me today. I really liked it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Is that so? His eyelashes trembled, and his eyes were filled with sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But between them, there was never any love!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The person she once loved was not him either!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Would she still fall in love with him, like this?</p></div>
