        <h1>Chapter 4154 Are you afraid I will get hurt?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the end, Chandler said, "Alright, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just as the two of them walked out of the hospital building, several reporters rushed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Holding their microphones, they all directed their questions at Chandler, "Mr. Hunter, do you have anything to say about today's fire accident?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Did the factory have any safety hazards that were not addressed in a timely manner? Doesn't this show that the Hunter family doesn't value the lives of ordinary workers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "How does the Hunter Group plan to compensate the workers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler frowned, while the reporters even started taking photos of Chandler and Tina. Despite Chandler's bodyguards and hospital security personnel trying to stop them, some people were still desperately trying to push their way forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There was even a reporter who saw Chandler leaving without saying a word and anxiously shouted, "The Hunter Group is profiting off the blood of the people. Don't you plan to be accountable to the public?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Before Chandler could speak, Tina suddenly stepped forward, "On what basis do you claim that the Hunter Group is profiting off the blood of the people? If you have no evidence, then isn't it defamation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The reporter was taken aback and then said, "Isn't the fire the best proof?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "The cause of the fire has not been determined yet. Can't you refrain from making baseless accusations like this? Who gave you the right to spread rumors?" Tina said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Miss Stephenson is really defending your fianc&eacute;! I just want to seek justice for the people who were injured in the fire. Even if the Hunter family and the Stephenson family have power and influence, those people are just small individuals in the city. But you can't play God..." The journalist put on a righteous and stern look, but secretly felt excited inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This was a great opportunity to make a name for himself! If he portrayed himself as a small person seeking justice, as long as he established this image, he could have better career prospects in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He could also gain more attention and even become a benchmark of some sort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You&mdash;" Tina was so angry that she almost rushed forward to hit the person. It was just nonsense!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler reached out and tightly held Tina's hand, then coldly stared at the journalist. "Is that so? If I really had the power to cover up everything, do you think you could still say these things in front of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cold gaze made the journalist's heart skip a beat, and a cold sweat broke out on his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The truth behind this fire will be revealed by the fire department. And as for those injured in the fire, the Hunter Group will take care of them. There's no need for you to seek justice for them. Of course, if you care so much, you can donate to help their families or volunteer at the hospital to assist them. The Hunter Group welcomes kind-hearted people like you," Chandler continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The journalist widened his eyes. Donate? Volunteer?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What does this have to do with anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just wanted to create a sensational news story and establish a good image for himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there were other journalists and cameras around, he couldn't refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the journalist could only reluctantly agree on the surface, but he felt disgusted inside!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler protected Tina and got in the car. As soon as they sat in the car, Tina looked at Chandler with concern. "Don't take those journalists' words to heart, especially that last one. He's simply despicable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler raised an eyebrow. "Are you afraid I will be hurt by those words?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mm," she responded. Those words were just too harsh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't be hurt," Chandler said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those verbal attacks meant nothing to him. If it weren't for that ignorant journalist involving Tina, he wouldn't have wasted a single word on him.</p></div>
