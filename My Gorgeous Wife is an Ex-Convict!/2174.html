        <h1>Chapter 2172</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, he's gone," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed also froze and blinked. Although he thought William would leave sooner or later, he did not expect it to be so sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper jumped down from her chair and ran toward William's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she came to the room door, she pushed it open, only to see a desolated room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The blanket was folded as neatly as she had seen it when she came in yesterday. Nothing in the room had been touched. If anything was missing, it was the doll he usually placed beside the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a doll she liked very much, and she gave it to him after he came to the Reed family&rsquo;s house!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the room that was the same as yesterday, Jasper thought of what she had said to William in the room yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is... Is he really gone? Did his biological father come to see him yesterday? So he left?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper suddenly burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Jason came over too. When she saw her daughter crying, Grace immediately hugged her daughter and comforted her gently. "Alright, stop crying. It's a good thing William went back with his daddy. He has a father, so he can't stay with us forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Boo-hoo... He told me he'll always be here, and we&rsquo;ll always be together. Why did he..." Jasper wailed as tears trickled down her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But William wants to be with his daddy too, just like you. Don't you like being with your daddy, Jasper?" Grace tried talking with her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the little one would not listen. She just kept crying. "I want William. I want William. Boo-hoo... He left without telling me. Is... Is he mad because... because I said I hate him and wouldn't be his friend anymore... Boo-hoo..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace instantly knew why William called Philip Barlow in the middle of the night and requested to leave after hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed it had something to do with her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Jasper did not go to kindergarten today. She kept crying while Mick Reed accompanied his sister. At the end of the day, the little one's eyes were red and swollen from crying. It made Grace's heart ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, Jasper insisted on sleeping in William's room because she thought William would come back. They were best friends, and he would not leave without saying a word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed thought about it and went to William's room with his blanket. He said sternly to the worried Grace, "Mommy, I'll sleep with my sister and take good care of her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at her thoughtful elder son and her daughter who had swollen puffy eyes. She said, "Alright, take good care of your sister tonight, Mick."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed nodded his little head solemnly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, as the two little ones lay in bed, Jasper said with a nasal voice, "Brother, I miss William. Even... Even though he pushed Nelson down the stairs and lied to me, I still miss him. I don't want him to leave... Boo-hoo..." She felt like crying again as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you really miss him, let's go and bring him back then," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper Reed's eyes lit up, but the glimmer in her eyes dimmed again. "What if William's daddy refuses to let him come back? His daddy won't let him come back after taking him away, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We can sneak him back without his daddy knowing," said Mick Reed.</p></div>
