        <h1>Chapter 1450</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really? If... If one day you find out that I had hurt you before, will you never accept me again no matter how much I beg for your forgiveness?" He asked that question with such difficulty that every word seemed to be squeezed out of his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace turned around and looked at the man in front of her with a somewhat puzzled look. "Jay, what's come over you? I keep having a feeling that you've been extremely uneasy these days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was silent. 'Uneasy... Yeah! I'm indeed uneasy.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn and Martin Weiss's incident had made him uneasy. He feared that the same fate might befall him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If what I said made you uneasy, I can explain! I just thought of Sean and felt a little emotional because of what Kyla said. You don't have to overthink it. How could you have possibly hurt me? Besides..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She paused. She raised her hand and gently caressed his brows, which seemed to be tinged with melancholy. "Didn't we make a promise where I'll forgive you as long as you cry in front of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She deliberately said this to lighten the mood, wanting to get rid of the sadness in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, after listening to her words, his eyes lit up slightly. The melancholy seemed to gradually disperse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, my feelings for you will never change. They won't change no matter what happens in the future." He placed her right hand to his heart and put her palm flat against his chest. "So promise me that your feelings for me will never change too!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She blinked. 'Feelings... change! It's what I learned today, but Jay is insisting that feelings won't change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'My feelings for Sean had already died with time and pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I only have Jay in my heart. My feelings for him...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"They won't change. My love for you will never change, Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said solemnly, and the palm of her hand seemed to feel his unusually fast heartbeat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps some feelings in this world would change, but some would not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's phone rang in the middle of the night. Grace opened her eyes in a daze, only to see Jason listening to the other end of the line with a serious face. A moment later, he said, "Got it. I'll be right there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, he put away his phone and said to Grace, "I'm sorry to have disturbed you. Go back to sleep. I'm going out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Where are you going?" she asked hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was late. It was no ordinary phone call if he was going out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason hesitated a little. "I'm afraid Grandpa can't hold on any longer. I'm going to see him one last time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was immediately shocked. She had known all along that Old Master Reed's health was worsening and he would not be able to hold on much longer, but... so soon?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'The old man who raised Jay, so to speak, is leaving this world?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had an indescribable feeling for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll go with you," she said at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No thanks. I can go myself," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She insisted and said, "I'll go with you! He's your grandfather. Even if the old master doesn't like me, I'm still his granddaughter-in-law. I can wait for you outside if he doesn't want to see me."</p></div>
