        <h1>Chapter 480</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. All right. Grace is the most filial," Grandma said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Filial? Grace's face showed a slight hint of sadness. If she were filial, she would keep her grandmother beside her and take care of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was now living with Jay. If she wanted to keep her grandmother beside her and take care of her, she would have to talk to Jason in advance and get his permission first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't mind, you could ask Grace to take you to Emerald City. She could take care of you, Grandma," Jason's voice rang out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and looked at Jason in surprise; she had not expected him to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma seemed surprised. Nevertheless, she said with a smile, "You're sweet, but I'm used to living here. Besides, I have my sons and daughter here. If I let my granddaughter take care of me, people will probably start gossiping. I'll visit you in Emerald City when I get better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma turned to Grace once more and said, "All right. You should go back early or it'll be late when you reach Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. "I'll come and visit you again, Grandma."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After bidding Grandma goodbye, Grace and Jason got in the car. Jason started the car, and the car slowly began to drive away. Meanwhile, Grace looked into the rearview mirror and at her grandmother who stood motionless in the same spot, seeing them off. Grace could not stop her eyes from watering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having visited Grandma that day, Grace felt that Grandma had grown much older than before. It seemed like the illness had greatly damaged her health despite the fact that she had recovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was true that when it came to the elderly, a long time was often needed before they were fully healed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're worried about your grandmother, I could get someone to bring her to Emerald City," Jason's voice rang in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "No, Grandma might be better off resting at home." Although First Uncle, Second Uncle, and Third Aunt were not that filial, they each had one thing in common.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was, they were always proud of themselves. Everyone in the town met regularly, and most of them knew each other. If First Uncle and the rest did not take good care of Grandma, they would be branded as unfilial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not to mention, Grace had noticed that her grandmother's clothes and bedding in the room looked clean. In that respect, it could be said that First Uncle and the rest were doing quite a good job of taking care of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for today," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank me?" Jason raised an eyebrow. "Are you thanking me for having driven you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for tolerating my relatives," replied Grace. With her grandfather's sarcastic remarks and the comments her Third Aunt and cousin made, none of her relatives were rather welcoming. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't tolerate them, I merely dismissed them as nonexistent," said Jason. He was only there to accompany her. Naturally, he had no regard for them. "Don't you get angry when they talk about you like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I still get angry sometimes, but I&rsquo;ve gotten used to it. It's no big deal. I told myself that even though we're relatives, I don't need to care about what they think or say because we don't live together. We only see each other a few times a year after all," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was because Grace had been through enough that she knew better than anyone else that no matter how well she behaved and how hard she tried to please others, in the end, people who would never like her would exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she only cared about those who truly cared and were concerned about her. She no longer cared about the rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason snuck a glance at Grace who was seated quietly with the corner of his eye. She seemed as if she had been enlightened about life.</p></div>
