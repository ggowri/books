        <h1>Chapter 3281</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper brought Lawrence back to the Abbott family. The Abbott family was naturally very surprised. When Jasper mentioned Lawrence's injury and that he wouldn't be able to practice the piano for half a month, the Abbott couple's expressions immediately changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, immediately after, Wilona quickly added, "We will definitely take good care of Lawrence and help his hand recover as soon as possible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Jasper left, Wilona immediately frowned and turned to her son. "How did you manage to hurt your hand while playing the piano? If your piano skills decline, Jasper might not want you anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, you should know that our family is relying entirely on the Reed family now. If you don't pull yourself together, Jasper won't value you in the future. Do you think we'll still have such good days?" Doran also scolded his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence kept his head down and listened to his parents scolding him without saying a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that the only thing he could rely on now was the piano, and he was more aware of this than anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence hasn't been going to piano lessons for a while, but Jasper still calls from time to time to ask how Lawrence's hands are doing and if they still hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made him feel quite happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, it will be Christmas time again. Every year during Christmas, the school will decorate and many classmates will exchange Christmas gifts with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In previous years, no one gave him Christmas gifts. But this year, even before Christmas, many classmates have already asked him what kind of Christmas gifts he likes. Obviously, as long as he speaks up, the other party will find a way to give him the gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that they didn't really want to give him the gift, but it was because his family had now become associated with the Reed family. These classmates, or rather their parents behind them, wanted to please him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But...actually, these people don't understand the real situation at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So when others asked him, he always said he didn't want anything in particular.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On Monday, while he was at school, a classmate suddenly ran up to him and asked, "Lawrence, aren't you good friends with Jasper from the Reed family? Then why didn't she bring you along when she went to the amusement park?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, are you guys really good friends or not?" someone asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Amusement park?" Lawrence paused for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I saw it online!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although only in third grade, many children have their own phones or are allowed to use their parents' phones for a certain amount of time each day. As a result, they may come across news online, especially news that their parents may bring up and discuss with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My parents also mentioned this! Lawrence, why didn't they bring you along to play?"</p></div>
