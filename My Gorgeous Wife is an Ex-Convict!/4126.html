        <h1>Chapter 4124</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina received two concert invitations. Eugenia Massy, upon hearing the news, practically glued herself to Tina. "My dear Tina, take me with you. We're such kindred spirits. Taking me to the concert will allow you to experience more joy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I never thought you could say such shameless things," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"For Kit's sake, I can say anything!" Eugenia seemed determined. After all, the tickets for this concert were extremely hard to come by, and the prices were rumored to have reached tens of thousands of dollars per ticket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, this was also because Kit's band was currently very popular. Moreover, their contract was about to expire, and once it did, the members would go their separate ways.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, this concert was considered to possibly be the band's last performance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Naturally, the ticket prices for this concert were higher than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well then, please continue. Let me see what other shameless things you can say," Tina said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eugenia wiped her sweat, but she was determined to get those concert tickets. "My goodness, in the future, whoever you want me to deal with, I will deal with. If you go east, I'll follow you east. If you go west, I won't go east. If one day you have an argument with Chandler, I will firmly stand by your side! If you fight with Chandler, even though I'm physically weak, I will join you and fight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Come on, this was already her greatest sincerity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina couldn't help but laugh. She never expected her friend to have such a funny side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, alright, I'll take you," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You said it, so you can't back out!" Eugenia said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Am I the kind of person who easily backs out?" Tina responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But by the way, why did Kit's dad send you concert tickets?" Eugenia asked. The relationship seemed a bit distant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"His dad knows that I'm a fan of Kit. He was there when I wanted an autograph!" Tina explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's so great!" Eugenia exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Tina was a bit surprised that Kit's father sent her concert tickets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the day of the concert arrived and Tina went to the concert venue with Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The venue was already packed with people, and many fans who didn't get tickets were waiting outside, hoping to catch a glimpse of Kit!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina stood outside the venue with Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Originally, Tina didn't plan to waste time waiting outside just to catch a glimpse of Kit. After all, she had already seen Kit several times during this period, and she would be able to see him in person at the concert!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Besides, she and Kit were also rumored to be dating, and she was afraid that she would be recognized by the fans at the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, because Eugenia wanted to see her idol before entering, and Tina didn't want to leave Eugenia alone, she decided to stay outside with her!</p></div>
