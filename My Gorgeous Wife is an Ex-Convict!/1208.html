        <h1>Chapter 1207</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a car suddenly pulled up and Stella got out of it. There was a look of surprise in her eyes when she saw Grace. She stepped forward and said, "Grace, why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath and said to Stella, "I want to see Brian. I have a friend who's seriously injured and is in the ICU. I want to ask Brian for help. If... possible, can you take me inside to see Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Knowing Stella would never agree due to their recent feud, but for Lina's sake, Grace would give it a try anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, just as she expected, Stella wore an embarrassed look and said, "I can't help you. As you know, you and Brian ended on bad terms today. Brian is still mad. Won't Brian get mad at me if I bring you in? Sorry, but I can't help you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Stella turned around and got back into the car. The iron gates opened slowly, and the car drove in. Sitting in the car, Stella looked through the car window at Grace who was standing outside with a pained expression. She could not help but curl her lips, revealing her satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not going to let Grace see Brian so easily. She was waiting for the misunderstanding between them to grow bigger and bigger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched bitterly as Stella's car drove slowly into the mansion, and she could only see the iron gates closing in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wait!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was going to wait!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This might be the only way to see Brian. She would wait until he emerged from his mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the security guard nearby, Grace said, "I won't leave, but I won't do anything else either. The road outside the mansion must be a public road, so I'll stand here. If you still want to call the police, you may do so!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guard hesitated for a moment but said nothing more. He turned and went back to his spot. After all, the security guard had heard the conversation between Grace and Stella. He already knew that the woman knew Miss Lindsay, so she probably knew Young Master Hart too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without knowing exactly what Grace had to do with Brian, the security guard did not want to offend anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stood where she was. The night had become so dark that even the moon seemed to be shrouded in a black veil, looking a little gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up blankly at the moon in the sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was on the hill with Brian as a child, she had looked at the moon in the sky in the same way. She was not afraid during the day, but she was afraid and could not sleep when the night came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he had said to her in a gentle voice, "Don't be afraid. I won't sleep. I'll protect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Protection. Yeah... As promised, he did protect me and save my life, but how did we turn out the way we are now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now was even the time when she needed his help the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Bryn, please, save Lina!' Grace kept crying out in her heart. Pressing her lips tightly, she dialed Brian's phone number again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Pick up! Pick up!' She was consumed with anxiety. She thought she had become strong after all the things she had been through, but now she realized that there were still too many things that would make her helpless!</p></div>
