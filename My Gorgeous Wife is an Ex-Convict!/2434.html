        <h1>Chapter 2432</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only say that... she seemed to have given birth to a genius!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The computer expert instantly became silent. The Barlow family's security system was famous in Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the child really did hack into the Barlow family's security system previously, the Mitchell family's security system... should be a piece of cake for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">About half an hour later, Mick Reed's childlike voice was heard saying, "There are several entry points for me to hack into the system. Should we disable the system now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, not yet. Disable the system later when needed," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," the little one nodded and said before furiously typing on his mini laptop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason and Brian set out to figure out how to get Amber Mitchell out of the mansion after the security system was disabled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How many men do you have at hand?" Jason asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian instantly understood Jason's question. "Ten skilled bodyguards who can be mobilized. What about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "That's a good number of men. Then let the men sneak in and bring her out. If they get caught, they can just break out together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." The two went with that plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll get the psychiatrist who will re-examine Amber Mitchell. Amber Mitchell will be sent to the psychiatrist as soon as she leaves the Mitchell family's mansion," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian nodded, indicating he was alright with that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the two people in front of her, Grace had a strange feeling. In her impression, it was the first time they had worked together like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the two decided on the time to start the mission, they began to arrange their own men. Brian had also found several computer experts to cooperate with Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The experts that Brian found were naturally elites in the field. When they first saw that they had to work with the little one who was only six years old, they instantly felt insulted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they had no complaints and were just surprised when they saw the little one in action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out one could describe some geniuses as beyond one&rsquo;s imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They decided that it was better to do it after dark, so they ate in the cafe first. Brian and Jason asked for several private rooms for the others to dine in. In the current private room, there were Brian, the Reed family, and the computer experts. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the meal, the computer experts would communicate with each other about their experiences and problems they encountered. Mick Reed, who was usually quiet, was talking more now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, he could provide solutions for the difficult problems those experts talked about, which surprised them. Before the meal was done, the little one had almost become a treasure they valued very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was not in the mood to eat because she was thinking about the rescue operation. Jason put some food in her bowl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can't eat that much," Grace could not help muttering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Eat as much as you can. This might run late today. If you eat too little, you&rsquo;ll soon get hungry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and ate a few mouthfuls. Just then, a feeling of nausea suddenly came over her. She immediately got up, covered her mouth with one hand, and hurried out of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s and Brian's expressions changed as they rushed out of the private room one after another. Grace rushed into the women's washroom, while Jason and Brian could only stand outside and wait.</p></div>
