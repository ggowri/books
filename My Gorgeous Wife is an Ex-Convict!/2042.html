        <h1>Chapter 2040</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Wow, it seems Nelson is popular with little girls. Even three-year-olds like Nelson," quipped Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn's young but handsome face could not help blushing. He was thin-skinned and had no idea what to say, so he could only eat with his head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... Juliet was the first person to offer to help him protect his hearing aid. Nelson Corbyn's long eyelashes quivered a little, and what flashed through his mind was that he would play with her when he met Juliet again next time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After lunch, the group walked out of the restaurant and bade goodbye to each other. Lina got into the Stephenson family's car, while Grace sent Kyla and her son back to their store first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A woman was sitting in a cafe next door. Her eyes stared intently at Kyla's figure as she got into the car. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Kyla... We meet again!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Paisley Daniels said grimly to herself. Her misfortune was caused by Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The Kong family had fallen, and she had spent five years in prison where she was tortured and ridiculed! She used to live glamorously and was the future mistress of the Weiss family. Many people fawned over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, anyone could trample on her in prison. Many female prisoners far inferior to her would trample on her to gain a distorted sense of existence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All she could do was endure it and wait for the day she could get out of prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Kyla... Why should I suffer when this woman can live a peaceful life with her son?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Even though Kyla didn't get together with Martin Weiss, I could&rsquo;ve been with Martin if it weren't for Kyla!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Kyla doesn&rsquo;t want Martin but is unwilling to let me have him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Paisley Daniels's heart became filled with pain and hatred at the thought of Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had done so much for the man, but the man was so ruthless to her in the end. He was more ruthless to her than Kyla back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I must let this man taste pain. Definitely!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, Grace told Jason about her encounter with Chase Harper during the day. Jason could not help frowning. Speaking of which, if he were asked which man&rsquo;s presence posed the biggest threat to him back then, one was Brian while the other was Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although Chase Harper came from an ordinary family, looked ordinary, and did not seem to have any redeeming qualities, he was a so-called &lsquo;nice man&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason felt more threatened because of his &lsquo;nice&rsquo; personality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew that Grace liked &lsquo;nice people&rsquo;. She had also taken him back to her rental house because he was a &lsquo;nice person&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Were you happy?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Of course, I'm glad to have met an old friend after a long separation, but he might not be very well off now. I find it a little..." Before Grace could finish speaking, Jason suddenly grabbed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, his lips were already on hers and he was kissing her hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Um... Jay..." As soon as Grace opened her mouth, Jason took the opportunity to silence her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was almost out of breath from his possessive kiss.</p></div>
