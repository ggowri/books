        <h1>Chapter 2953</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Camille was lost in thought, Valda's voice rang in her ear, "Camille, Brian and I are back together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Getting back together would be nice," Camille replied casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a few seconds, she suddenly seemed to realize something and stared at her friend with widened eyes, "What did you say? You and the prince are back together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Correct," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... why did you decide to be with the Crown Prince again? Is it because he saved you and played the hero this time?" Camille asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment of contemplation, Valda said, "I think this incident made me realize something. No one knows what the future holds, but at least for now, I have found someone I love and who loves me back. It's not easy to come by. Although I don't know if we can be together in the end, I don't want to give up without trying. I can't bear to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The fact that the Crown Prince was willing to take a stab for you shows that he truly cares for you. I think you two have a good chance," Camille said with a grin. "Come to think of it, maybe my mishap was a blessing in disguise. Otherwise, you and the Crown Prince might not have reconciled so quickly. If you two get married in the future, don't forget to give me a big red envelope."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt a little embarrassed by her friend's words. "We just got back together. You're already thinking about marriage. Isn't that too far-fetched?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it? Don't you want to marry the Crown Prince?" Camille teased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Marriage... If they get married, they will have children. Then, she remembered what Brian said this morning about eyelashes being a dominant gene. Their children would most likely inherit long eyelashes...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What would their children look like?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, what are you thinking about?" Camille's voice interrupted her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda suddenly realized that she was thinking too far ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, it's almost dinner time. Why don't we go out and have a meal together? There's a mall nearby..." Camille suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda suddenly remembered, "Oh no, Brian said he would pick me up after work today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took out her phone and quickly dialed Brian's number as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment, the other end of the phone was answered and Valda said, "Brian, I'm not at the studio right now, you don't need to come pick me up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm at the police station right now, just came out from there. The police caught the woman Camille brought up last time, so we came here to confirm it." Valda said, "Later, Camille and I will grab a bite nearby. I'll come back after I finish eating."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me come over then, do you mind having one more person?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused for a moment, glanced at her friend beside her, and then quietly relayed Brian's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille immediately smiled and said, "Of course I don't mind. I was just thinking of treating the prince to a good meal to thank him for saving my life!" This was the perfect opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So Valda and Brian mentioned the name of the mall they planned to go to, "Once Camille and I arrive at the store, I'll send you the name of the store and the seat number, but we're just going to eat at a regular restaurant in the mall." It wasn't the fancy club that he had taken her to before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I understand," Brian responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille and Valda picked a Cantonese restaurant in the mall. Camille specifically chose a relatively upscale one, with the intention of repaying Valda's kindness. Naturally, she selected a better one within her budget.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"First of all, let me make it clear that I'm treating you today. Thank you very much to you and the Crown Prince for saving my life. Otherwise, I would feel guilty." said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it a bit expensive?" Valda looked at the menu and said, the dishes on it are not cheap, and it is estimated that it will cost her friend half a month's salary for a meal.</p></div>
