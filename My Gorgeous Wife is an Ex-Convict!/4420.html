        <h1>Chapter 4418: I Can</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley blinked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He meant to say...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you telling me that our relationship isn't headed towards marriage?" she asked seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah?" This time, it was Calvert's turn to blink.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think I'm just playing with you?" she asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" His face flushed red, "I know you're serious about me, it's just..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think we'll actually get married?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained silent, as if by his silence, he was agreeing with what had been said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, the more they interacted, the clearer the gap between them became.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being in a relationship is already a stroke of luck; how could I even dare to dream of marriage!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her boyfriend looking so downcast, Harley suddenly didn't know whether to feel sorry for him or to be angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She always understood his insecurities.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the gap between their families was huge and unchangeable, so all she could do was show her love for him as much as she could, hoping he'd understand her feelings and gain a bit more confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But clearly, it seems she still doesn't have enough confidence in her boyfriend!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen to me carefully now, I'm not some kind of anti-marriage advocate, nor do I enjoy playing dating games. When I'm in a relationship with you, I'm in it for a lifetime commitment. If I hadn't considered the possibility of marriage, I wouldn't have started dating you in the first place." Harley held Calvert's face in both hands, speaking earnestly and seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes suddenly widened in disbelief, "But... my family... compared to yours... the difference is too vast. No matter how hard I try, I can't catch up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This also gave him a deep sense of helplessness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to think that as long as he kept climbing up, seizing every opportunity, one day he would be worthy of her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he realized that even if he truly reached what he thought was the peak, it was still far from enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood so high that perhaps he could never truly climb to a height where he could stand beside her in his lifetime!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents never looked down on you, so why are you looking down on yourself?" Harley said. "If family background was really a concern from the start, then we wouldn't have ended up together at all."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said with a gentle smile, "Do you hope that we'll date and maybe get married someday?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared into her eyes, lost in thought for a long while, before finally nodding slowly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So stop feeling inferior, you're my boyfriend, and maybe one day you'll be my husband. You should be proud!" She smiled. "What I want is a love that doesn't make people suspicious or anxious. I want someone who can love me for a lifetime. The love I imagine is about two people becoming better because they love each other, not losing themselves in fear of loss!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert, I don't need you to achieve great things, but I do hope you can pour your passion into what you truly care about. And me, I'm willing to be your support."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, if you're tired, you can lean on me, and when I'm tired, I can lean on you. This kind of support doesn't need money or status; just being by each other's side is enough to bring us peace."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him and said, "Calvert, can you be my rock?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips quivered slightly, and then he heard his own voice say, "I can do it!"</span></p></div>
