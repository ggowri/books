        <h1>Chapter 3902</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stared at the man who was so close to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he was much taller than her, he was willing to look up at her like this, silently telling her that he was willing to submit to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This man would hold her in the palm of his hand for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica lowered her head and kissed Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kiss was filled with so much emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the moment she first saw him as a child, she couldn't take her eyes off him, always stepping forward to protect him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although they had been lost and missed each other, they finally ended up together when they grew up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, they are happy together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, their child will be born, and they will live a happy life together with their child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, you are the love of my life!" Veronica whispered softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's eyes softened even more, and the once indifferent black pupils were now full of deep affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are the love of my life too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A night of tenderness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of her pregnancy, he was especially gentle with her in that aspect last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was quite satisfied with her husband's performance last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for their honeymoon trip, Veronica didn't choose to go abroad because of Mason's student status and her pregnancy. Instead, they chose a city near Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The trip was short, only three days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you think this honeymoon trip is too simple?" Mason felt like he owed Veronica something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He only wanted to give her the best and didn't want her to have any regrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it's not. This is still a honeymoon trip, and from the beginning, our honeymoon trip was with our child. After the child is born, we can travel again and go to all the places we want to go with our child," Veronica said. "Mason, we have only lived a quarter of our lives. We still have a long future ahead of us. So, for me, a three-day honeymoon trip is enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, she still has a lot to do next, such as applying for a leave of absence, going through every prenatal check-up, and preparing various items for the unborn baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although many things don't require her to prepare, there will naturally be people to help her prepare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as a mother, she still hopes to prepare some things by herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During her free time, she can also read more books about parenting and attend some prenatal classes, so that she can better welcome this little life when the baby is born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Look, her schedule for the next period of time is already full.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And time always passes faster than people imagine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica was in the delivery room, screaming and pushing hard to give birth, Mason was also feeling uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, her hand was tightly gripping his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although his hand was in pain, he didn't seem to feel any pain at all. He just looked at Veronica with worry, afraid that she would bite her own tongue because of the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It hurts...it hurts so much...I...I'm in so much pain..." Veronica cried out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know how long she had been in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she could tell from the worried looks of the doctors and nurses that her situation was not going smoothly.</p></div>
