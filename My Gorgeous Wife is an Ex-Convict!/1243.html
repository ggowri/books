        <h1>Chapter 1242</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Loan?" Brian was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she stopped your car the other day because she wanted to borrow money from you, Young Master Hart. She seemed to want to borrow two million dollars," the security guard said as he recalled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression immediately changed as soon as he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Two million? Why would Grace want to borrow two million all of a sudden? Did something happen?' The moment he closed his eyes, his mind flashed back to the despair on her face last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'At that time, I was probably her only hope to borrow the money!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But what did I do? I simply killed all her hope!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'With her character, she would never borrow money from me unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Something... Something must have happened that I don't know about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She stood there all night. She stopped my car desperately not for Chase Harper, but to borrow two million dollars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I believed in Stella. I didn't even get out of the car or listen to what she had to say. I just left!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Brian wanted to slap himself in the face. 'Why was I so stupid? Why didn&rsquo;t I listen to her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He fished out his phone from his pocket, but his fingers seemed to have no strength. With a thump, his phone dropped to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian crouched down to pick up his phone, but it took several times before he finally picked it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With difficulty, he found a phone number in his contact list and dialed it. "Look one thing up for me. I need to know the reason..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was silent after finishing the call, but his hand that was holding the phone revealed his nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was about half an hour later when his phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Brian answered it, a man's voice came from the other end of the line. "Young Master Hart, I've found out what you wanted me to check. Miss Grace's friend, Lina, was admitted to the hospital for serious injuries a few days ago. The medical bill was quite high. I think Miss Cummins came to see you that day to get the money to pay for Lina&rsquo;s medical bills. But this morning, Lina&rsquo;s hospital expenses had all been paid for and she was transferred to the best neurology hospital in Emerald City. The person who settled the fees and transferred Lina to another hospital is Mr. Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Brian only felt like he was struck by thunder. 'So... that's the truth?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out she had stood here all night for Lina. She probably had all her hopes on him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what did he do instead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah! Ah!" Roars came out of Brian's mouth, which also startled Patrick and the security guards nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When had the ever elegant and noble Young Master Hart scream hysterically like a madman while he slapped himself over and over again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, don't do that!" Patrick quickly grabbed Brian's hand. "What are you doing?"</p></div>
