        <h1>Chapter 580</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, news of Evelyn having broken up with Brian quickly became a trending search topic. It has to be said that online comments suggesting that Grace had stepped in to cause the break up were quickly deleted each time they were posted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Grace was completely left out of the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Brian had so many ex-girlfriends, it was no surprise to the public that "another girlfriend had been dumped". Many even said that they knew Evelyn would be dumped. After all, those female celebrities who were more popular, more beautiful, and more educated than her, had been unable to escape being dumped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared with Brian's ex-girlfriends, Evelyn had little to merit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people had therefore speculated that Evelyn's future status in the entertainment industry was probably going to take a dive. People had previously flattered her because she was Brian's girlfriend, but now she was at best an "ex-girlfriend".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Evelyn's private apartment, Tony Cummins and Melinda Riley looked worriedly at their daughter. They had learned from their neighbors that their daughter had broken up with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the neighbors had said in a tone of amusement, "Don't worry too much about it, the entertainment industry's crown prince has always dated one girl after another. Evelyn is lucky to have dated him. Otherwise, Evelyn would still be playing a small role now. How could she have become the female lead and star in commercials?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were both furious when they heard that. Additionally, when they walked out of the neighborhood, they were constantly pointed at by the other neighbors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had once strutted around the neighborhood, telling everyone that their daughter was Brian's girlfriend and that Brian had given their daughter a lot of expensive jewelry, designer clothes, and bags. Naturally, they had also bragged that she would marry into a rich family someday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had done so to wash away the shame they had gotten from Grace's imprisonment which had left their family powerless in their neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was now great. They were as embarrassed as pompous as they had been earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you really break up with Brian, Evelyn? Can't you get back together?" Melinda Riley asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes. You can't just break up all of a sudden. Aren't both of you all right?" asked Tony Cummins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not that easy to get back together!" Evelyn said despairingly. The moment a man like Brian had made up his mind, it would not be easy to change it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, she was just a substitute after all. Only her "lips" looked like the person Brian was looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lips... As she thought of it, Evelyn's heart was twisted with jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her lips did not only look similar to Grace's. There was Brian's painting. What the girl in the painting looked like, and the floral dress she was wearing... It was clear to her that the person Brian was looking for was probably Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of it made her hate Grace more than ever! As a child, Grace was a good student and had been a clever and sensible sister in her neighborhood. She was every bit better than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelyn had thought that after three years in prison, Grace would have fallen into an abyss and would not be able to get over it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who would have thought that Grace would catch Jason's eye and was now even the person Brian was looking for!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned out to be a substitute for Grace after all, and now she was not even qualified to be one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's all Grace's fault! She brought this upon me! She's the one who sabotaged my relationship with Brian. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have broken up with Brian," Evelyn said through gritted teeth.</p></div>
