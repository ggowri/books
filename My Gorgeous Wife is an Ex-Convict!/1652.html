        <h1>Chapter 1650</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What?" Katherine Jackson asked in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Didn't Hadwin Stephenson take so long to plan this just to destroy the Jackson family? But now he said he's willing to give us a way out?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I can lend the Jackson family a sum of money. At least, you can keep the Sunshine City project after this crisis," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson's heart shuddered. &lsquo;Does Hadwin Stephenson mean the Jackson family can't keep anything but the Sunshine City project after this crisis?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'In that case, the Jackson family will be kicked out of high society! The rest of our assets will also be stripped!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But... maybe we'll have a chance to turn things around with Sunshine City!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why will you lend money to the Jackson family? What are you up to?" Katherine Jackson asked sternly. Hadwin Stephenson must have a greater plot if he was willing to offer such conditions!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I want to break off our engagement," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson suddenly sneered. "Break off our engagement? Are you worried you can't break off the engagement now that the Jackson family is in such a predicament?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I want you to tell the media that we've reached an agreement to break off the engagement. Besides, you let Lina bear such a label. You ought to clear her name, don't you think so?" Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Katherine Jackson shuddered suddenly. A thought flashed through her mind, and her eyes slowly widened. "Are&hellip; Are you using Sunshine City to negotiate with me just for Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What else? Why would I give the Jackson family a way out otherwise?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson's eyes are full of shock. 'Just because of Lina, Hadwin Stephenson&hellip; is giving away billions of dollars!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had devised such a scheme to bring down the Jackson family, but... he would rather sacrifice that money and even leave unfinished business just for a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson felt that she did not understand this man at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you going to give up easy money for a woman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'For a woman...' Hadwin Stephenson looked at Katherine Jackson coldly but did not answer her. He was not just doing it for a woman. It was for his everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In his opinion, Lina was his everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could give the Jackson family a way out just for Lina, but... The Jackson family's plot had caused Lina to suffer serious injuries, so they would still have to pay the price!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was only letting them off the hook for now... He would make the Jackson family suffer more in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "Just do whatever you have to do. There&rsquo;ll be a good show tomorrow, and I need you to cooperate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson's face turned ghastly pale. She was once proud and confident, but she had become a pawn to be manipulated by others now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though Hadwin Stephenson did not answer her, she knew what the answer was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Hadwin Stephenson is... actually giving up so much money for Lina and letting the Jackson family off the hook for her sake! What's so good about Lina that he&rsquo;s willing to make such a huge sacrifice?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, Katherine Jackson thought of how the man had pleaded with her as he knelt in front of her five years ago. "Please, save Lina. Save her! I'll give anything if you're willing to save her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was so humble back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that time, she thought little of Hadwin Stephenson. He was only a bastard child who managed to gain power over the Stephenson family. He was still a loser in that internal fight.</p></div>
