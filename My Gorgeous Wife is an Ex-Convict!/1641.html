        <h1>Chapter 1639</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The hot news in the outside world these two days was undoubtedly about the large-scale real estate project Jackson Group had prepared for pre-sale being suddenly suspended. At the same time, Stephenson Group had announced that it would stop cooperating with Jackson Group. The Jackson family was also exposed for a series of problems including financial fraud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although no one knew how serious it would get, it was enough to make the Jackson family suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was even news that Jackson Group's capital chain was strained, and the most recent bank loan repayment would be due in three days. If the pre-sale project was still not approved in three days, the Jackson family's capital chain was likely to rupture and bring down the whole company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Due to the changes in the Jackson family and the Stephenson family these days, the scandal about Lina had cooled down. What started as a cliche love triangle turned into a business war.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The comments online were also interesting. [Have Hadwin Stephenson and Katherine Jackson fallen out?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">[Is their wedding on the rocks? The Stephenson family's going to protect themselves. It's the end of the Jackson family!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">[Hadwin Stephenson's not deliberately distancing himself from them to be with the homewrecker, is he? Let's just wait for the Jackson family to go down.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">[Who would give up money for a mistress? You could have any woman like that by spending some money, but Hadwin Stephenson can get the Jackson family's fortune if he helps the Jackson family get through these difficult times. It's billions of dollars we&rsquo;re talking about. Hadwin Stephenson would be crazy to give up billions of dollars for a mistress! I bet Hadwin Stephenson is just waiting for a more suitable opportunity to take over the Jackson family. He's a businessman, after all!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Businessman?' Lina looked at the comments with mixed feelings. 'Did Hadwin Stephenson ask me to wait a few days just to see the Jackson family get in trouble?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, even if the Jackson family was in trouble, she would still be labeled as a homewrecker. The only difference was that she would be attacked less online and was no longer as &lsquo;popular&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;Perhaps Hadwin Stephenson will be able to take over many of the Jackson family's properties in a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;But the Jackson family's fortune will be his one day if he marries Katherine Jackson. Why is he going through so much trouble?' Lina could not figure it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had a habit of not wasting her brain cells by thinking about things she could not figure out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, there was a knock on the door and Mrs. Sweeney walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mom, why are you still up?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I can't sleep, but your father's already asleep," said Mrs. Sweeney as she walked to Lina's bedside and sat down. "Do you know how many more days we're gonna be here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina shook her head. Hadwin Stephenson had not given her a specific date.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mom, if you want to go home, then we..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Go home? Your incident's still in the spotlight. The neighbors will question us if we go home. We might as well stay here where it's quiet," said Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sorry, I didn't think it through that day," Lina said guiltily. If she had insisted on shaking off Hadwin Stephenson's hand and not going to the hotel that day, all this mess would not have happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We're family. There's nothing to apologize for. But..." Mrs. Sweeney paused, "What's going on with you and Hadwin Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing. Mom, he and I have broken up. We'll have nothing to do with each other after this," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Sweeney sighed. "Oh, what's with this mess? You and Anthony Sherman are already getting to know each other. Now that this has happened... How are you going to get a boyfriend if others think you're a homewrecker?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Sweeney worried about her daughter's future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina figured that she might have to cut ties with Anthony Sherman even though he had called to comfort her these two days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, even if Anthony Sherman did not care about the online gossip, it did not mean his family would not too.</p></div>
