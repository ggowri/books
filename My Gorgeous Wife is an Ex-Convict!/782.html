        <h1>Chapter 781</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His game with her ended here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On her 28th birthday, she realized God&rsquo;s cruelty to her was far deeper than she had imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her slender body dragged her two suitcases behind her as she descended the stairs with some difficulty. Finally, on her way out of the main house, she met Reed Residence&rsquo;s butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The butler was surprised to see Grace dressed in plain old clothes, looking like she was leaving as she dragged her suitcases.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Miss Cummins, where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;m moving out. Jason and I have broken up, so there&rsquo;s no reason for me to stay here," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The butler looked surprised. &lsquo;Broke up? With Young Master Reed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;However... isn't it Miss Cummins's birthday today? Young Master Reed made a point of ordering the birthday menu for the evening.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, looking at the way Miss Cummins spoke now, she did not seem to be lying. The butler was in doubt for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Grace said nothing but continued to drag her suitcases out of Reed Residence step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Behind her, the butler hastily called Terrence, Jason's private secretary, to report the situation and ask whether he should get her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, who received the phone call, was completely shocked. He looked at his boss who was beside him, unable to stop the shock in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;They broke up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Young Master Reed broke up with Grace?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyone who was not blind could see how much Young Master Reed cared about Grace. He had never seen Young Master Reed so abased and so protective over a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;However... what happened today? When Young Master Reed left Reed Residence and drove directly here&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;This place is&hellip;&rsquo; Terrence looked at the corner. If Grace was here, she would recognize this was where she first met Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was also... where Jason's father froze to death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would come here every year on his father's death anniversary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Terrence knew that today was not Young Master Reed's father&rsquo;s death anniversary and that it was one of the first times in his many years of following Young Master Reed that he uncannily came here on a normal day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Could it have something to do with Grace?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence asked, "Young Master Reed, Miss Cummins is now dragging two suitcases, saying... she has broken up with you and is leaving Reed Residence. Are you going to let her go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's body gave a sudden jolt as his eyelashes quivered a little. His drooping eyes were still staring at the concrete floor where his father had closed his eyes forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t end up like my father! I mustn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let her go," Jason's thin lips spat these three words out coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was stunned and hesitant for a few seconds before responding, "Alright!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked out of Reed Residence with two luggages and found that she did not know where to go in the huge Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nowhere was her home, and that nowhere held her place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she finally had a home, but she did not after all!</p></div>
