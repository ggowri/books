        <h1>Chapter 396</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart instantly burst with a feeling called joy. It turned out that his trust could make her so happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at the woman in front of him while he continued to mutter out, "Believe me, if I had met you earlier and if I had known I would love you so much, I wouldn't have let you suffer so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Was he referring to the fact that those people had maliciously attacked her to please him when she was in prison?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace answered with a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter what happened between them, maybe it was time to let it go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she wanted to get along with him, she should let go of her fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time the meal was over and the servants had cleared the table, Grace seemed to have suddenly thought of something. "By the way, do you know any experts in cochlear implants?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you ask?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, Kyla's son, Nelson, may need a cochlear implant someday. I was just wondering if we can get Nelson an expert on this, and... Although Kyla can only pay for the cheapest cochlear implant now, is it possible for us to get a better cochlear implant for Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said a little uneasily. She had learned about it herself online and knew that there was a huge price difference between the good and average cochlear implants. According to Kyla, she only had enough money to give Nelson one cochlear implant. It would be better if they could install two for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's funny that you&rsquo;ll ask for my help for an outsider, but not for your own problems," quipped Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It must be fate. I like Nelson. He can't hear, so he can't learn to talk. If he gets a cochlear implant, he'll be able to live like a normal child," said Grace. Every time she saw him speaking sign language with his tiny hands, she would feel a pang of sorry for Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The attachment and intimacy Nelson showed her made her unconsciously want to be nice to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You like children?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They&rsquo;re not too bad. I didn't think I liked children much before, but then..." Her voice stopped in the middle of her sentence, and her hand, which was at her side, unconsciously touched her lower abdomen. A flash of pain passed over her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" His eyes glistened as the pain in her eyes stung him like a sharp knife. "Just tell me if you have any problems. I'll take care of even the biggest problems."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If only her eyes would stop showing so much pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you serious about dating me?" asked Grace as she looked up at Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." His answer was so resolute and unswerving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I..." She took a deep breath and bit her lip. It was like trying to speak out the most unspeakable part of her that was buried deep in her heart. "My body may not be fertile at all. If you're with me, you may never have children of your own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body was so broken that it could not even bear a single life.</p></div>
