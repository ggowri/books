        <h1>Chapter 2805</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze. There was a look of hesitation in her eyes as if she were wavering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his hand and flicked Valda Theller between the eyes. "You don't seem to love me very much. How are you going to make me fall in love with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She put her hand between her eyes where he flicked and stared blankly at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, don't you want to make me fall in love with you?" His voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tears suddenly rolled down her eyes. It happened so fast that she was caught off guard. She did not expect herself to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears surprised him. Then, he was flustered. "Was it too painful? Sorry, I didn't watch myself&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before he finished speaking, she suddenly jumped into his arms and burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she was trying to vent the helplessness, fear, and grievances she had suppressed in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was more flustered as he looked at the person crying in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he knew what he should do, his hands and feet seemed to stiffen. The words he wanted to say came out in stutters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"D-Don't cry, Valda. If you want me to apologize to you, I can..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No apology is needed. You... You're good. You're good. You're... the best boyfriend ever..." Valda Theller sobbed. She could not help crying in front of him because he was so good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her aunt's family had long described her as a Jayx. They always blamed her if anything bad happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it did not bother Brian when he heard these. Did he know how much his words meant to her? It was as if he had given her hope in the darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why are you crying?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me... cry for a while. Just for a while... Boo-hoo... I'll be fine..." she said nasally as she continued crying with her head in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, her crying gradually stopped. Brian could feel that the clothes on his chest were wet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After sniffling, Valda Theller looked up and wiped her tears while apologetically looking at his shirt that was wet from her tears. "Sorry, I... I've ruined your shirt. Why don't I help you wash it later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's not necessary," said Brian. Looking at her red and swollen eyes, he felt a sudden dull prick in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've made a fool of myself," Valda Theller said awkwardly while taking a tissue to wipe away the tears on her face. "It's funny, isn't it? They're my relatives. They should be the closest people I have in the world, but instead..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was full of agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "The things they&rsquo;re asking for are nothing to me. I don't mind giving them what they want. If you want them to treat you better, I can get it done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller shook her head. "No thanks. I would&rsquo;ve helped them borrow money from you just now if I wanted you to do that. I don't want my family to be bought with money. Besides, they&rsquo;ll only be more insatiable in the future if I give them money this time."</p></div>
