        <h1>Chapter 802</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was undoubtedly attractive to women!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla thought of a time when she wanted a sip from the bottle of mineral water Martin Weiss drank from. To put it nicely, it was indirect kissing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she thought about it, she was terribly naive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she said, "Martin Weiss, I think you and I know very well that you have no right to keep me here. I'm a free woman now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Free?" He chuckled. "Then how much do you think it would cost me to keep you from being free?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This sounded almost like a threat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart sank, knowing that he was telling her that he was fully capable of controlling her freedom and could even find another reason to send her to prison again if he wanted to!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of her time in prison, Kyla's body could not help shaking slightly. Her face became paler and paler as well while her red lips were pressed together tightly. Her hands on her knees were clenched into fists as if she was desperately suppressing the fear in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her behavior made him frown, then he put down the water bottle in his hand and went up to her. "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the moment his hand touched hers, she suddenly screamed, "Don't touch me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tone and the look in her eyes seemed to be filled with a profound revulsion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened as he grabbed Kyla's hand. "So what if I touched you? Kyla, let me tell you. Unless I don't want to touch, you have no right to refuse me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain in her wrist jerked Kyla back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cold, pretty face that caught her sight told her that she was not in prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just now... She had fallen into a trance and thought she was back in prison again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, I can't go to jail again! I mustn't go to jail again. I have Nelson to raise!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, if you want to have a baby, you can find a woman who&rsquo;s willing to be a surrogate to bear you one! You don't have to come to me," said Kyla after taking a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You owe me a life!" he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you're asking me to pay you a life?" She pursed her lips. "However, you hate me so much. Do you really want me to give you a child? Besides, even if I gave you a baby, Paisley Daniels probably won't want to raise a child of my blood. After all, I caused her to lose her baby, didn&rsquo;t I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss narrowed his cold eyes slightly, frowning even more. "Why, are you finally admitting that it was you who harmed Paisley?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I admit it." She smiled. "I admit I harmed her. Are you satisfied now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she said that she had not and that she was wronged, what good would that do? She was just humiliating herself over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should have admitted it earlier so that she could finally erase the man from her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only felt an uncomfortable feeling spreading from his heart. Her admission did not seem to make him feel good. Instead, his chest felt like it was being pressed by something, and it made him a little out of breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't need you to tell me whether I'm satisfied. Besides, after the baby is born, Paisley won't know that you're the mother," he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He has it all figured out!' Kyla looked at the man quietly.</p></div>
