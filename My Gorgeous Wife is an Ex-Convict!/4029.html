        <h1>Chapter 4027</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick looked at the person in front of him for a long time, and finally, his throat hoarsely uttered one word, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the compromise that they had to make as a last resort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, this decision was also a matter of life and death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he said "okay", it meant that he would be with her no matter what, even if it meant risking his own life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was willing to accompany her with his own life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two days later, Nancy was escorted back to Emerald City by the Reed family's special car and admitted to the best hospital in the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctors and experts in Emerald City had already studied Nancy's condition, so as soon as she arrived at the hospital, they began to treat her in an orderly manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was also very cooperative with the treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her body was slow to recover from her injuries and she often experienced various pains, it took her more than a month to barely get out of bed and walk a few steps after being admitted to the hospital in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she felt the small life inside her more and more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fetal movements became more and more obvious. When the doctor monitored the fetal heart rate, she could hear the strong and rapid heartbeat. In addition, there were ultrasound examinations that showed the development of the baby at different stages and its movements in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Life is really wonderful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So even though her body was in pain, every day, Nancy felt as if she was filled with hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to give birth to this child safely and become its mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This belief was growing crazily in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Nancy was 30 weeks pregnant, she saw the news online that Irene was being sued and going to court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A recent photo of Irene was posted online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The once crazy woman was now wearing a prison uniform and coming out of a police car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Irene's case involved the Reed family, it naturally became a hot topic in the whole city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the court proceedings were not made public, the result of the trial was posted online before the Reed family informed Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy couldn't help but sigh. She never thought that she and Irene both fell into the sea, but in the end...both of them survived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, it should be said that all three of them survived!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at her already big belly. Although the baby was getting bigger and developing well, she knew that her physical condition was actually getting worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she could get out of bed and walk a few steps briefly, she became more easily fatigued than before, and she would feel drowsy, dizzy, and suddenly have nosebleeds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first time she suddenly had a nosebleed, she didn't react much, but Mick was frightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face turned whiter than paper, and he almost stumbled as he ran towards her, shouting for someone to find a doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That day, she slept for a full 16 hours. Jasper said that during those 16 hours, Mick didn't sleep at all, didn't even eat anything, just drank some water, and stayed by her bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, my big brother is really afraid that something will happen to you, you know? When he sat by your bedside like a puppet, just staring at you, even I was scared, afraid that I would lose my big brother!" Jasper exclaimed to her like this.</p></div>
