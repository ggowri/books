        <h1>Chapter 1314</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyone else? Is anyone else willing to volunteer?" the nurse continued saying. Then, she walked up to Jason and said, &ldquo;Why don't this handsome expectant father here come up and demonstrate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Jason's exquisite appearance was quite striking among the group of expectant fathers, and the nurse could not help being attracted to his charms. Therefore, she wanted Jason to demonstrate on the platform, hoping to see more of the handsome expectant father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as soon as the nurse said this, the specialist on the platform was shocked! 'This... Letting Master Reed come on the platform to demonstrate? It's hardly what Master Reed would do!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason did not reject the nurse right away. Instead, he asked Grace who was next to him, "Do you want me to go up and demonstrate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you like to?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go if you want me to," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glanced at the man in the crisp suit. 'Okay. To be honest, she wanted to see what he would look like carrying a baby!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace nodded. "I want to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay then!" Jason smiled, got up, and raised his hand to take off his suit jacket. He then stood on the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All eyes were immediately fixed on him. After all, his tall figure, delicate features, and unique aura were just too attractive. Many expectant mothers even looked at Grace with envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The specialist was also stunned. 'Master Reed is... willing to demonstrate in public? And it's... all because Master Reed's wife said she wanted him to?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, the heir sitting behind Jason was the most surprised one here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, the heir was completely dumbfounded as he stared at Jason who was holding the baby simulator according to the instructions of the specialist on the platform. He only thought the world was out of its mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought he would live to see such a scene?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one would believe him if he told them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Gosh, the man is so handsome! Gosh, is he a celebrity? But I don't think I've seen him in any celebrity news," the heir's wife blurted out in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The heir let out a long breath and said in a somewhat weak voice, "It would be strange if you actually saw him in celebrity news."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about? I'll take a picture and post it on my Instagram and ask which celebrity he is," the heir's wife said, taking out her phone to take a candid photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The heir shuddered with fear and quickly grabbed her hand. "No... Don't do it. If you do, our company might go bankrupt tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The heir's wife was surprised. "What do you mean? Who is this man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In short, we'll talk about it at home," the heir said in a weak tone. He was still digesting what had happened today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason holding a plastic baby under the specialist's guidance. A smile could not help appearing at the corners of her lips as she imagined what he would look like holding their babies after they were born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was holding a fake baby in his arms, he picked it up carefully and learned how to burp a baby and put the baby to sleep...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would never have imagined seeing this side of him if it were before.</p></div>
