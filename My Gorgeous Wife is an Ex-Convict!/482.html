        <h1>Chapter 481</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt relaxed even though she was just sitting next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if just by looking at her like that, he could be relieved from the daily strenuous tension he suffered from this dog eat dog world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Others only saw how glorious he was, but he knew that the higher he stood and the more money and power he had, the more people around him would try to manipulate him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It might seem glorious, but it was in fact dangerous. Any carelessness might take down the Reed family's vast empire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he needed to be extremely careful in every step he took. Planning for ten steps ahead before taking one step was the norm for him. He would be so busy calculating every possibility that he forgot what it was like to relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe she was the only one who could give him that sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car pulled into the service station and Jason got out to buy water, Grace remained in the front passenger seat. She looked at the steering wheel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She still remembered the thrill of feeling the steering wheel for the first time when she was learning to drive. The money she spent to get her driver's license was paid for with her first legal fees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not think that a year after learning to drive, she would suffer what was a nightmare to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How long had she not touched the steering wheel? Almost uncontrollably, Grace raised her hand and reached for the steering wheel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her fingers touched the steering wheel, her heart seemed to go so fast that it almost jumped out of her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene of the accident flashed through her mind. She had turned the steering wheel quickly to avoid the other person's car, but everything seemed too late. The car just hit her, and she was knocked unconscious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How long was she unconscious? A few seconds? Or maybe a minute... Two minutes&hellip;?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she opened her eyes, she found blood on her head. As she struggled to get out of the car, all she saw was the car that hit her on fire...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to go over to put out the fire, but it was too late. The fire had engulfed the car almost too quickly&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gasped. Her hand that touched the steering wheel clung to it almost subconsciously while the veins on the back of her hands bulged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Stop thinking about it... Don't think about it!&rsquo; she said to herself, but her body continued to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she could only watch the fire spread. If... If her car had hit the gas tank, her car would also be on fire. She would...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could hardly conceive of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Lina said she was lucky to be alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment she saw the fire, her body shook as much as it did now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the car door opened and Grace subconsciously raised her head to look over at the driver's seat.</p></div>
