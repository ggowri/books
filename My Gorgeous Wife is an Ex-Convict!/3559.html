        <h1>Chapter 3557</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the door of the private room was suddenly pushed open, and a tall figure walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone in the private room saw Roger and exclaimed in surprise, "Hey, Roger, didn't you say you weren't coming? Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger smiled faintly and replied, "It just happened to be free, and I felt a bit bored, so I came over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper heard the voice and looked up, meeting Roger's gaze. For some reason, she suddenly had a feeling that he had come specifically for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, she silently criticized herself for overthinking things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could he have come for her? He himself said he came because he was bored!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why did he come here...was it just to join in the fun or was he looking for a girlfriend? Jasper's mind was filled with speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger was already popular among girls due to his handsome appearance, and now, naturally, girls flocked around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Similarly, many girls surrounded William, even though his attitude seemed cold. But Grace saw many girls persistently trying to strike up a conversation with William, after all, he was the eldest son of the Barlow family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although there were many rumors about Stanford University between Mr. Barlow and Jasper, they were not in a relationship. However, if anyone could catch Mr. Barlow's eye, then even if they couldn't marry into a wealthy family, there would still be many benefits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Jasper seemed like a bystander, just watching the boys' side, where William and Roger were surrounded by almost half of the girls who came to the mixer today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the number of people on both sides is about the same, and it is difficult to tell who is more popular.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper didn't expect that after a moment, she would become the subject of gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was because a girl asked Roger, "Roger, do you like any girl?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Roger replied directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who is it?" Suddenly, many girls became curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger didn't answer, he just looked towards Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was eating fruit and almost choked on it when he met Roger's gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cough...cough..." Jasper quickly swallowed the fruit, finally able to catch his breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Onlookers saw their eye contact and teased, "Roger, you don't have a crush on Jasper, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, everyone in the room focused their attention on the two of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked her eyes, feeling that the onlookers around her had too vivid imaginations. A few days ago, she wanted to get to know Roger better, but he looked at her with disgust. How could someone like that possibly like her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Jasper was about to deny it, Roger's voice suddenly sounded, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a sudden gasp from the surrounding crowd, and even Jasper herself gasped!</p></div>
