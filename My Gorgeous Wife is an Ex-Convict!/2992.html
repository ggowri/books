        <h1>Chapter 2990</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This will make Brian see that his girlfriend has absolutely no trust in him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, Whitney intentionally bit her lip and quickly released her hands as if to avoid suspicion. She turned her head and showed a timid expression to Valda, saying, "Miss Theller, please don't misunderstand. I...I have nothing with Brian. I just came here today to talk to him for a few minutes. What happened just now...it's really not what you think..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice stuttered and her face showed a hint of panic, which usually made people think there was something going on even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Brian's face was incredibly pale, a fear rising from the depths of his heart and quickly filling his whole body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he felt a hollow feeling in his heart, as if he was standing on the edge of a cliff and would fall into the abyss at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What would she think of the scene just now? Would she misunderstand? If she really did misunderstand, would she choose to break up with him again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the words "break up" flashed through his mind, the fear in his body became even more apparent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." He wanted to speak, to explain to her, but the sound that came out of his mouth was hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know what I'm thinking?" Valda looked at Whitney, a woman who looked like Grace and whom they had met before, so they could be considered acquaintances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney looked like a little maid, "Although I don't know what Miss Theller is thinking, I'm afraid you... you might misunderstand, but there really is nothing going on..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't misunderstand." Valda smiled slightly, "I also know very well that there is nothing going on between you and Brian. Maybe you want something to happen, but Brian definitely doesn't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Whitney was taken aback, and Valda's smile at the moment was particularly piercing to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you really don't need to explain anything to me. I won't have any misunderstandings. I know better than anyone that there is nothing between you and Brian that isn't completely innocent," Valda said, walking over to Brian with a smile. "Brian, I bought some cakes from a popular online shop today and I wanted to bring them over for you to try."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You...really..." he murmured, but the words seemed to be stuck in his throat and he couldn't get them out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I believe you," she knew what he was going to say and said directly, "because I believe you really like me and I trust your character. Since you are my boyfriend now, you will not be involved with other women!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at the woman in front of him, his fear and worry gradually disappearing because of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were clear and pure, filled with trust towards him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This is the woman he has fallen in love with, trusting him so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda!" Brian hugged Valda tightly, burying his face deeply in her shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her trust is so precious to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney, who was standing beside them, looked embarrassed. She felt like a clown who had dug a hole for Valda, but ended up making a fool of herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a resentful grit of her teeth, Whitney left dejectedly. Staying here any longer would only bring further humiliation upon herself.</p></div>
