        <h1>Chapter 3412</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the air, there is a tense atmosphere permeating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked down and took out her homework book from her backpack, ready to start doing her homework, when Mason's voice suddenly spoke up, "So, you don't want me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's pen shook abruptly and drew a heavy line on her notebook. "What are you talking about?" she said, looking up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as his face came into her view, her heart couldn't help but tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Mason's face still lacks expression, but his black eyes carry a hint of fear and worry. The way he looks at her is cautious and careful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Veronica felt a sharp pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looks like a child who is deeply afraid of being abandoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was reminded of him when he first arrived at the Barlow family. At that time, he seemed to be accustomed to being abandoned and indifferent to everything, just curling up alone in a corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was her who took the initiative to hold his hand, and finally managed to get him to open up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, before he became the second young master of the Reed family, she had already made a promise to herself to protect her little brother and be good to him for the rest of her life. She wouldn't let anyone bully him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I never said I don't want you. I'm your older sister, how could I not want you?" said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tension and unease in Mason's gaze faded slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why don't you let me take a look at your injury and help relieve your pain? I don't mean any disrespect towards you. You are the most important person to me, how could I not show you respect?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica realized that there were some things that she and him couldn't quite communicate about, so she tried to find another way to explain. "Um, you know how when boys and girls grow up, there are some things that they can't do together like they did when they were little? Like when babies take baths together, it doesn't matter if they're boys or girls, but when they get older, they don't take baths together anymore. It's kind of like that. Do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at him hopefully, wishing he could understand her meaning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, I just opened your clothes and looked at the injury on your shoulder, because as you grow up, it might make you feel uncomfortable, right?" he asked her, staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it's just uncomfortable," she quickly nodded and said, "Because as we grow up, our body structure changes, so... we still need to be careful about some things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I understand," he responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She immediately breathed a sigh of relief. He finally understood, so maybe he will be more careful in their future interactions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, his voice sounded again, "I'll go get you some red flower oil. You need to apply some medicine on your shoulder so that the injury can heal faster."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was stunned for a moment and before she could react, he had already left the room. After a while, he came back with a bottle of red flower oil in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can apply it myself," she said, reaching out to take the red flower oil from his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "It's inconvenient for you to clean that spot yourself, let me do it for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused for a moment, didn't he just say he understood a moment ago? How did things change so quickly...</p></div>
