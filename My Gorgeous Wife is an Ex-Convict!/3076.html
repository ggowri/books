        <h1>Chapter 3074</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is Camille looking for her or something? Valda opened the message sent by the other party online and saw a photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That's a photo of Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's eyes suddenly turned red, staring tightly at the person in the photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He has really lost a lot of weight. That day, she only saw him from afar, but now, this photo is so clear and obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt a pang in her heart as she looked at Brian in this state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If... If her legs weren't like this, maybe she would be eager to go see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But unfortunately... in the future, she will always be a cripple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The original her, standing next to him, was already so reluctant, let alone the current her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, there was a sudden and urgent knocking on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be that Camille forgot her keys? Valda wiped her eyes, not wanting her friend to see her red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Leaning on her cane, Valda shuffled over to the door and opened it. "Camille, are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The remaining words abruptly stopped, and what came into view was not Camille, but the person in the photo she had just looked at!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda stared at the person in front of her, stunned. She never expected that after a year apart, their first face-to-face meeting would be under these circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hair was disheveled, he was panting as if he had rushed over, and his eyes were fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In those eyes, there was longing, shock, and the madness of a traveler who was almost dying of thirst in the desert finally seeing an oasis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without waiting for Valda to speak again, Brian suddenly hugged her tightly and held her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's you, Valda. You're finally back. Do you know how long I've been searching for you? I waited for you, and it was so painful. " His voice choked up as he held her, and his empty heart slowly began to fill up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is this... the real her, not just his imagination?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda leaned quietly into Brian's embrace, the familiar hug that she had missed so much, making her feel nostalgic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every day since she regained consciousness, she has been desperately thinking about him. No matter how difficult it was, she used this longing to hold herself up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kept telling herself that she must come back alive and see him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to let him know that she was safe and sound, otherwise this man would blame himself and feel sad! Even if she died, her death would be less of a burden on him than the death of Grace's daughter, Jasmine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she didn't want to become his burden in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And how many more hugs like this could they have in the future? She would cherish every hug and remember it with all her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um, Brian, I'm back. I'm sorry for making you wait so long," she whispered, raising one hand to hug him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Holding him like this, she could feel his thinness even more vividly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Much thinner than she had imagined!</p></div>
