        <h1>Chapter 1655</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was wearing a navy blue suit with a black shirt. His bangs were combed back, and he was dressed in the same clothes she had seen in the video earlier today when the reporters surrounded him to interview him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina suddenly had a rather strange feeling. After all, she had just watched a news video of him during the day. Now, he was right in front of her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two stared at each other without speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a long time, Lina could not help but blink and say to Hadwin Stephenson, "It's... late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know." His magnetic baritone voice filled the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He knows? Then why is he still in my room? Okay, it's not really my room since he owns the entire apartment.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What are you doing here so late?" she asked after hesitating a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just wanted to see you," he said. He felt happy just sitting here and watching her sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her sleeping posture was as unattractive as ever. He watched her occasionally grind her teeth and roll about on the bed. It reminded him of their past together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a wonderful time for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "You slept soundly but almost rolled off the bed. Maybe I should make a bigger bed for you so you won't fall off it so easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was speechless. 'Did he come here in the middle of the night just to see me... roll on the bed?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"By the way, I saw the news today. I should be okay now. When can I go home with my parents?" Lina asked right away. Since he was here, she did not have to call him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you anxious to get home?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Duh! No one likes being restricted all the time, do they?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She paused and continued saying, "Hadwin Stephenson, I don't know what's going on between you and Katherine Jackson. I don't want to get involved either. I heard Katherine Jackson's remarks at the press conference today. This matter will be over as long as we have no further contact."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His expression sank slightly. "You don't want to be in contact with me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She answered him affirmatively, "Yes. Hadwin Stephenson, I thought I made it very clear to you the other day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What if I refuse?" he asked as he stood up and moved closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was suddenly amused. "Refuse? Who are you to refuse? We&rsquo;ve broken up. It was you who broke up with me! Have you come to me again because you've broken up with Katherine Jackson and have no feelings for her? What am I? A fallback girl?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A look of pain flashed through his eyes. "You were never a fallback girl!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She snapped, "But you&rsquo;ve been treating me like a fallback girl! Hadwin Stephenson, you don't have to love me and you can choose to break up with me. But please take relationships seriously. I'm human too. I get emotional. Even if I have no money and power, I'm not someone you can order around!"</p></div>
