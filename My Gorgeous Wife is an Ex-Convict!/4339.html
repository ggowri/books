        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Harley like this, Tina suddenly felt how lucky she was once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also a marriage agreement made at a young age, but her situation with Harley was completely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, I want to go outside and take a breath alone, "Harley said, then turned around and left alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pursed her lips without saying anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's hurried footsteps looked as if he was about to escape something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you tired? Do you want to go rest for a while? "A low and hoarse voice rang in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina turned her head and saw Chandler walking to her side at an unknown time: "No, I'm not tired yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're tired, just say hello to the Quentin family and you can leave early, "Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, "Tina smiled sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that he was worried about her physical condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she reached out her hand and hugged his waist, burying her face in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina? "Chandler paused for a moment, surprised by her sudden move." There are many people here now, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what? Anyway, we're husband and wife, so it's just a good time for those people to see how good our relationship is now, "Tina whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler smiled helplessly, but Tina hugged him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, as long as it's what she wants to do, he will agree and accompany her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And around them, there were indeed many people looking sideways at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, thank you, "Tina suddenly whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank me? Why do you want to thank me? "Chandler raised his eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for not giving up on loving me, "Tina said, knowing that even when he agreed to divorce and even signed the divorce agreement, he still loved her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has always been thinking for her, afraid of binding her down, afraid of her unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, there can be someone who loves herself like this, and she also loves them, she thought, she is really lucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you're worth it, "Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was she who slowly opened up his heart and made him love her more and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his heart, he was complaining about the unfairness of fate, and it was her smile and those words full of sunshine and warmth that made him change from resenting fate to being grateful for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to fate, he met her and tied them together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love you, Chandler! "Tina looked up and looked seriously at the person in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more you truly understand him, the deeper you will love him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love you too, Tina, "Chandler replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she not love her like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I want to get pregnant quickly, okay? "Tina suddenly coquettishly said to Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler frowned and said, "Didn't we agree to wait a year until your health improves before you get pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina is a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can only blame Lornell's medication for its poor efficacy. I used it at the time, but I didn't conceive a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she can only wait for a year, but she hopes to help him earlier and make him no longer suffer so much!</span></p></div>
