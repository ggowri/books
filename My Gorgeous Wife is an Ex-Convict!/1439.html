        <h1>Chapter 1438</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I want nothing to do with him. Besides, with my current condition, it's uncertain whether the operation will be successful even if I undergo a liver transplant. It may still fail afterward," said Kyla Corbyn. She would have had a much better chance of surviving after a liver transplant if her illness was only stage one or two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she was in stage three now, and it was too late. It probably would not be of much use even if the surgery was successful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I can get Jay to find the best doctor to operate on you," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled gently. "Grace, thank you. You've done enough for me. I don't want to spend the last months of my life lying in a hospital bed. If I have the operation, then I may be stuck in the hospital bed until the very end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't want to waste these months. Surgery doesn't mean much to me now," she said. She knew her condition was getting worse day by day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In that case, why bother with it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace knew Kyla had accepted her fate, or rather... it was because of the difficulty of the operation and Kyla's rejection of Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla, you have Nelson and Aunt. Are you willing to give up on them?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled wryly. "No, but so what? Grace, I know what you want to persuade me to do, but I've made up my mind. I can't afford to bet my last few months on the success of an operation!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's heart sank. After all, there was no guarantee that the operation would be successful and that after the operation, the cancer cells would not spread. It was still a possibility that there would be adverse reactions&hellip; and many more other risks!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was understandable why Kyla could not afford to take this gamble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Grace left, Mrs. Corbyn came over and said, "Kyla, since Martin Weiss is willing to donate his liver, why won't you accept it? Having a glimmer of hope is better than no hope at all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Corbyn had also heard some of Grace and Kyla Corbyn's conversation. Hence, she found out that Martin Weiss had no idea about Kyla Corbyn&rsquo;s illness before this and he had not rejected the liver donation through the phone call previously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "Mom, I'm scared! I know there's a glimmer of hope, but I'm scared that my body won&rsquo;t be able to leave the operating table. Or maybe I won&rsquo;t be able to leave the hospital anymore even if I do. The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Fate had often given her hope in the past before giving her fatal disappointment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was stunned, not knowing how to persuade her daughter all of a sudden. Rather, she also shared the same fears as her daughter! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Over the next few days, instead of setting up the food stall, Kyla Corbyn took Nelson to the kindergarten every day. She also accompanied her mother at home and made regular visits to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Life was peaceful, but she felt more fulfilled than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps this was the only time she could finally take the burden of living off her shoulders and quietly live the life she liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could accompany her mother to the market, make a good meal at home, and use her phone to compile her son's photos into a digital album...</p></div>
