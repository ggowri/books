        <h1>Chapter 4087</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they first approach the specific person, they will feel a strong reaction in their body. Their blood will boil, and they will feel an uncontrollable urge to get closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he was younger and heard the elders in his family describe this feeling, he couldn't understand it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when he saw Auntie Sweeney, who was pregnant with Tina, for the first time, he suddenly understood this feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Tina was still in the womb, he knew that the baby inside her was the one who could cure his poison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a strange feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he later became engaged to the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, he knew that if he wanted to survive, he needed to have a child with Tina. Only then could he live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Get out." Chandler said to the servants at the hot spring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The servants filed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler took off his clothes and immersed himself in the blood-red medicinal bath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A familiar pain swept over his entire body all at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He gritted his teeth and tried to endure the stinging sensation caused by the medicinal bath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Due to the medicinal bath, the poison in his body struggled as if it were trying to break free, causing waves of pain to constantly sweep over and spread throughout his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> For him, the time he could wait was getting shorter and shorter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And the time he spent soaking in the bath was getting longer and longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The pain caused by the poison, which used to be occasional and mild when he was a child, had intensified both in duration and intensity with each passing year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If he didn't find Tina, he didn't know how many more years he could hold on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the past, people who died because they couldn't find their destined person included those who were 30 years old, 40 years old... but ultimately, they couldn't live past 60 years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because they couldn't bear the pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So when Tina was still a fetus, he found her, and everyone said he was lucky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was able to find his destined person so early on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As long as he took good care of her as she grew up, and waited until she reached the legal age to get married and have children, they could get married naturally, have children, and then he could live!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But...if Tina were to find out the truth, how would she view him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the medicinal bath, Chandler endured the pain as his body slowly began to change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His once normal skin color now had a black line extending from his abdomen towards his heart, resembling a venomous snake. The skin below his collarbone became rough and bumpy, as if countless venomous insects were gnawing and sucking his blood beneath his skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Tina was cautiously approaching Hunter's old mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She parked her car in the nearby bushes, hoping it wouldn't be discovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to the GPS she placed in Chandler's car, she was only 500 meters away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">500 meters may seem short, but for Tina, it felt like an eternity.</p></div>
