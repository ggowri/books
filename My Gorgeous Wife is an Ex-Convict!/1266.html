        <h1>Chapter 1265</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian ignored her and ordered his men, "Take everything valuable off her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he said this, everyone there was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Take off? Here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Didn't they say Stella saved Young Master Hart's life? They're so close that Young Master Hart gave Stella many resources. He even gave her money and a mansion!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is the crown prince falling out with her?' The crowd wondered what was happening, but no one stood up for Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They only saw someone walking up to Stella and stripping her of all her jewelry and even her gown!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't... Brian, how could you do this to me... I saved you. No matter how wrong I was, you can't humiliate me like this!" shouted Stella as she struggled hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her struggles were useless. A moment later, all that remained on her were her undergarments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella stood in the hall, looking like a mess while others watched. She only wished she could pass out, but the way Brian's phoenix eyes stared at her was so scary that she dared not pretend to faint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt she would probably meet a much worse end if she pretended to faint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let the others leave," Brian lightly ordered his men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" the men answered and began to chase out everyone in the banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone naturally knew they could no longer watch the show! Even so, they had learned a lot today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the crown prince was not leaving any dignity for Stella despite being in front of everyone. Stella was probably a goner! The crown prince&rsquo;s actions were like telling Stella that he had given her everything she owned, and now, she was going to lose all of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, all that was left in the previously bustling banquet hall were Brian, Stella, and Brian's men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella said with a flushed face, "Brian, you have to make things clear even if you want to do this to me. Is this because of that video?" Stella still thought Brian was only doing this to her because of the video playing on loop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Framing Chase Harper was not the only wrong thing you did!&rdquo; Brian stared at the woman in front of him coldly! The ordinary woman only had a high school education and not much knowledge. She had not even managed to get out of the secluded village before she met him. He never thought he would be so badly deceived by a woman like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been so miserably deceived this whole time when he thought he was clever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you... really save me back then?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella immediately shuddered at the question but replied like how she always had, "Of course... It was me. Who else would it be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was you?" Brian suddenly laughed, but his phoenix eyes turned crimson as he stared at Stella with fierce hatred. "What a fool I was! Why didn&rsquo;t I think of investigating it properly even though I had doubts? Stella, you're amazing. I never expected myself to be fooled by a woman like you one day!"</p></div>
