        <h1>Chapter 3312</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In those eyes, there is a full depth of affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is him in her eyes, someone who deeply loves her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And from her painting, he also saw how much she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He carefully took the painting down from the shelf and put it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every drawing she makes of him, he keeps it carefully. As long as she wants, he can let her keep drawing him until they both grow old with white hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And these paintings will bear witness to their love before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the night of New Year's Eve, Valda brought Lisa to the villa where Brian and Valda live. Brian's parents also came, and the two families celebrated the new year together at the villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the meal, Mr. and Mrs. Hart, who are elderly, took the initiative to toast Lisa. To them, Lisa's act of saving Valda was not just about saving Valda's life, but also about saving their own son's life and the entire Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So they have always respected Lisa very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside, there are also people who mock the Hart family's relative as an uneducated rural old lady.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, every time the elderly Mr. and Mrs. Hart would go to great lengths to defend Lisa's reputation, even confronting others directly. Over time, although there may have been gossip behind her back in high society circles, no one dared to speak ill of Lisa to her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa naturally doesn't know any of these things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since arriving in Emerald City, she spends most of her days staying in the house that Valda bought for her, and occasionally taking a stroll around the neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Normally, Valda comes to visit her, and sometimes young people from their village who work in Emerald City come to visit her after finding out where she lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Lisa is very clear in her heart. She knows that these people who come to visit her are only trying to establish a relationship with her goddaughter. So, she avoids them if she can, and if she can't, she just laughs it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, as Lisa looked at the harmonious scene, she also had many emotions in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, she thought she would live a lonely life and die in her rundown house, perhaps someone kind in the village would wrap her in a mat and bury her in a hole, and that would be it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she never imagined that her life would undergo such a drastic change as it has now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa smiled and raised her glass, returning the toast to her in-laws.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she's not much of a drinker, she still has to drink this alcohol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing their meal, the family gathered around the large TV screen in the living room to watch the New Year Gala. Valda was used to watching it every year, so they all decided to join in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tonight, Mr. and Mrs. Hart, who are elderly, and Lisa are staying overnight at the villa, so there's no need to worry about them returning too late or anything like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda watched the New Year Gala and then looked at the family members around her. Suddenly, her nose felt a bit sour and even her eyes started to turn slightly red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was the first to notice that something was wrong with Valda. He lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, "What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda shook her head and deliberately spoke with a volume that everyone around could hear, "Brian, I want to go back to the room to get something. Will you come with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whatever it is, just have Brian go get it," said Mrs. Hart, the elderly woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda said, 'He's not sure where to put it.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian said, "Okay, I'll go with you to get it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them then returned to the room.</p></div>
