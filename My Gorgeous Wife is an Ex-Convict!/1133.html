        <h1>Chapter 1132</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was preoccupied when suddenly a voice came from the lounge. "Huh, what are these?" It was the voice of the cleaning lady in charge of cleaning the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, someone said, "What... What's with these photos? Wow, that's so gross!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Photos?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella shuddered and suddenly remembered that she had tricked Robert Brewer into trading photos with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that she did not follow Robert Brewer into the lounge after giving him the drug. Instead, she calculated the time the drug would take effect on Robert Brewer while waiting outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The original idea was that after Robert Brewer and Grace's scandal was discovered, she would take the photos away while others were not looking. However, she did not expect things to be the complete opposite of what she expected, so she totally forgot about taking the photos back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella rushed into the lounge, only to see several people looking at the photos in their hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, someone said, "Hey, this looks like Stella."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wow, really? The woman's so unsophisticated. It can't be her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's taking intimate photos with this ugly and unsophisticated guy. Hey, this guy looks like the guy who was carried out on the stretcher earlier!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was trembling with anger! She had put a lot of effort and thought into this. Instead of Grace getting humiliated, she was the one being greatly humiliated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did this happen?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was not the only one trembling right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wu Mincui never expected that the woman she bullied in prison would be taken away in such a protective manner by Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyone could see how protective Brian was of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Isn't Grace an ex-convict? How did she get together with&hellip; Brian? What the hell is going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wu Mincui only felt that her brain was not working properly. What feared her more was whether Grace would ask Brian to take revenge on her after the way she treated Grace in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wu Mincui just wanted to slap herself at the thought of this. She wished she had not appeared in front of Grace today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave her statement at the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was attacked by Robert Brewer when she arrived at the lounge today. She sprayed him several times with the pepper spray in her bag, and when he could not see, she took the opportunity to pull the shoelace off her sneaker and tied Robert Brewer's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she called 120 and 110!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you contact me?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't... have your contact information," she said a little uneasily under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was stunned. All his former girlfriends had asked him for his phone number. However, he was always the one going after Grace. It seemed that she had never taken the initiative to come to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Talking about her taking an initiative, it was probably the time she wanted to go to the charity gala to seek out Martin Weiss that she took the initiative to come to his company to see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pressing his thin lips together tightly, Brian suddenly pulled Grace's phone out of her hand. He quickly keyed in his phone number and created a new caller ID in her contact list.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No matter what happens, you can call me if you think you need help," said Brian before returning the phone to Grace.</p></div>
