        <h1>Chapter 1960</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Doesn't this woman... already have a pregnancy pillow? How could... Does she understand what it means to break into a man's room in the middle of the night and do that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does she think I'm numb?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Lina's body scooted closer to Hadwin Stephenson. He could even smell the faint fragrance of her body from the tip of his nose. He could also feel her breathing down his neck and earlobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It felt like a test to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could hardly suppress the desire that was thrashing about in his body because of her actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though he repeatedly told himself that he had no expectations for their relationship, he still wanted her so badly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, do you not take me as a man?" Hadwin Stephenson suddenly sat up, opened his eyes, and glared at the woman sleeping beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could see her sleeping position as well. The pregnancy pillow was here, but her arms and legs touched him from over the pillow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina instantly opened her eyes and sat up when she heard Hadwin Stephenson's roar. "You... You're not asleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You would&rsquo;ve woken me up even if I had fallen asleep!" Hadwin Stephenson snapped. She had stirred up the desire in his body, but as the person responsible, she was looking at him innocently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The moon shone through the window on her palm-sized face, round eyes, little nose, and red lips. The swelling of her cheeks had subsided a little now, but they were still a little swollen, which made her face look puffed up like a hamster. She was indescribably cute. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She's just trying to seduce me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I didn't know I'd wake you. I just couldn't sleep and wanted to come over. Uh... I thought maybe I could fall asleep next to you because we're familiar with each other," Lina explained hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Familiar?" He suddenly snorted coldly. "So if you can't sleep and another man you're familiar with is in the room next to yours, you're going to lie in that man's bed too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She blinked, and a look of hurt appeared on her face. "You're the only man I'm familiar enough to share a bed with!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she said left him dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you don't like it, then... I'll go back to the guest room," said Lina as she pitifully picked up her pregnancy pillow and prepared to get out of bed to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His heart ached again at the sight of the way she looked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just this once. There's no next time!" he said in a cold voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She immediately put back the pregnancy pillow and lay on the bed, pulling some more of the blanket that was over his body over her. She did everything almost in one breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was a little speechless at this. "Aren't you afraid I'll do something to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Uh... As much as I'd love for you to do something to me, I'm pregnant. While it's okay to do it in the second trimester, I think I should exercise restraint for the safety of the baby," she replied solemnly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, sleep!" Hadwin Stephenson snapped as he lay back down and closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her scent was still at the tip of his nose, making it difficult for him to sleep.</p></div>
