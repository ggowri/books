        <h1>Chapter 3898</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica handed the bouquet in her hand to Shirley, the bridesmaid standing next to the stage. Then she raised her hand and placed it on Mason's hand, and he led her to face the officiant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, and to love and cherish, till death do you part?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I do!" Mason said without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The officiant then turned to Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, and to love and cherish, till death do you part?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's gaze turned to Mason, who was standing next to her, and their eyes met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was also looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his dark eyes, there was a gentle light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This man was the one who loved her and would protect her for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I do!" These three words came out of her mouth with unwavering determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You may now kiss the bride!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As these words were spoken, her veil was lifted gently, and his kiss landed softly on her lips, like the melting snow of late spring, giving a feeling of coolness and hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guests around them applauded at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a kiss, Jasper stepped forward and handed over the wedding rings for the couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason and Veronica exchanged rings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rings on their fingers represented a lifetime commitment to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, you used to be my Veronica, but from now on, you are my wife! I love you for the rest of my life," Mason said in a voice that only they could hear, leaning down gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I love you too, for the rest of my life," Veronica smiled and raised her arms, embracing Mason's neck and kissing him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So sweet! Everyone who came to the wedding witnessed their love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at the embracing Mason and Veronica, and his gaze couldn't help but turn to William standing on the other side, only to find that William's eyes were also looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their eyes met, and Jasper felt her heart beating faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if at this moment, there was only each other in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps love at first sight was this kind of feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They would have such a day in the future too, wouldn't they?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They smiled at each other, as if understanding each other's feelings at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding was lively. After the ceremony, there were some performances and the toast from the newlyweds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the best man, Mick and William naturally had to drink for Mason, but who would dare to easily pour them more alcohol? They only took a sip and that was it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The so-called red wine and white wine are often diluted with water, so they won't make you drunk easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mick accompanied the newcomers to the table where the Schultz family was sitting, Clarissa's eyes lit up. She had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only on such occasions can she get close to a talented person like Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But soon, she was disappointed.</p></div>
