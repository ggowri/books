        <h1>Chapter 1811</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He froze, wondering why she was crying when he had already eaten the chocolate she gave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why... are you crying?" he asked after swallowing the chocolate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper sobbed, "Because... Because you lost your mommy. Boo-hoo... William, you must be... You must be so upset, but... But the chocolate I gave you can't cheer you up... What can I do to cheer you up... Boo-hoo..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was a little stunned. 'Does she... want to make me happy that badly?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's not important... whether I'm happy. I'm going to end up alone anyway," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She sobbed, saying, "It is important! It's very, very important! Besides, you're not alone, William. You and I will always be together. There are two of us... Boo-hoo!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She sobbed louder and louder. Suddenly, her little body leaped over and she hugged him while continuing to cry. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William had a strange feeling. He should be the one who was upset, but she was the one crying her eyes out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it somehow warmed him that she was crying as she held him. He felt warmer like this than being in bed alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William burst into tears as though he was influenced by Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The tears that had been repressed earlier finally fell because of Jasper Reed's crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, the two children held each other and cried together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a long time, the crying finally stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With tears and snot all over her face, Jasper said to William as she held the chocolate, "Chocolate. I... I still have a piece of chocolate here. William, try it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at the chocolate she was holding. Her tears had gotten on the wrapper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He took the chocolate out of her hand, and his fingertips touched the tears on the wrapper. His fingers were instantly burning...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Peeling off the wrapper, he split the chocolate into two and held one half to her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper blinked her tearful almond-shaped eyes and said, "William, eat it. It's for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let's eat it together," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hence, she opened her mouth and ate the chocolate, while he put the other half into his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the same chocolate, but this time, he found it... so sweet and delicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He took out his handkerchief and gently wiped the tears and snot from her face. "Don't cry like this anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It warmed him that she had cried for him, making it seem as if he was not alone in this world and someone still cared about him. However, at the same time... her tears upset him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He preferred to see her smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper said, "Okay. From now on, I won't cry if you don&rsquo;t cry! William, let's be together forever, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His lashes quivered a little. 'Forever?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he might leave this place any time. When she no longer liked being with him, Uncle Reed would send him out of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, there was no way he and she could be together forever.</p></div>
