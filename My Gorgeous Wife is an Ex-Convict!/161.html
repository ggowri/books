        <h1>Chapter 160</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Pah!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A crisp slapping sound rang out.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Due to how abrupt it was, Grace had no time to react. It was not until she felt a burning sensation on her face that she realized what had happened.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You must be that vamp!" the other party said hatefully. "I hadn't been expecting you to ask Brian to bring you to a place like this for dinner. You're just a third-rate celebrity. Do you really think you'll be able to secure the position of being his girlfriend? Let me tell you, it won't be long before you're dumped by him!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace looked up. Surprisingly, she recognized who the person who had slapped her was!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emily had originally been a second-tier actress who often played some supporting roles. However, after getting together with Brian, she had become famous with his support.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Some had previously wondered if Emily would be Brian's last girlfriend. After all, Emily had been the one to stand by Brian's side the longest.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, unexpectedly, Emily had ultimately ended up as just another ex-girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You've mistaken me for someone else!" Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm not mistaken. You came here with Brian tonight, didn't you?" Emily looked at the woman in front of her jealously. She felt that the woman in front of her couldn't be compared to herself. Even her clothes were incomparably shabby. "How long do you think you can stay with Brian? If he dumped me today, he could also dump you tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace looked at her coldly. "It's none of my business whether he wants you or not, but the relationship between me and him is not like you think, so please apologize to me!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She suddenly did not want to endure it anymore. She had had to endure everything when she had been facing Jason, and she was having to endure everything now she was facing Brian. However, now that she was encountering this unexpected misfortune, she did not want to suffer the slap in vain.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if she was now on the lowest rung of society, and even if prison had worn away all of her sharpness and edges, it did not mean that she could be beaten and scolded as others pleased.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she was how she had been back then...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Apologize? You want me to apologize to a shameless vamp who hooks up with another person's boyfriend? Dream on! Don't think that Brian is yours. He won't touch you at all. You're just someone who can be replaced at any time!" Emily said jealously.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, she didn't look as gentle and quiet as she had ordinarily on TV and in the news. She looked like a shrew swearing on the street.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, some people who were going in and out of the washroom also stopped to watch the scene.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Some of them had already recognized that one of the women was the popular star, Emily.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, those who could come to this restaurant for a meal were not ordinary citizens. No one took out their phone to take videos or photos.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're not going to apologize?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you need me to say it multiple times? How can I apologize to someone like you, you..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Emily could finish her words, Grace suddenly raised her hand and slapped her on the cheek.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Pah!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The crisp sound rang out again.</p></div>
