        <h1>Chapter 2054</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once inside, Mrs. Corbyn froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss and his men had subdued the children, while the originally unscathed Nelson was covered in bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson, how are you? Are you okay?" Mrs. Corbyn asked frantically as she held her grandson in her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn shook his head. His face and body ached, but he did not want to worry his grandmother. Besides... Nelson Corbyn's gaze shifted to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not want to appear weak in front of the man he was supposed to call his daddy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The man had made his mother suffer so much. She never told him that she was wrongly imprisoned because of his father's testimony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he could read and look up the case online, so he knew his mother would not have gone to jail if he had not testified for that wicked woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, he would never forget how his mother had begged his father in the park, but his father slandered his mother and blamed her, asking her to make amends with that wicked woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wanted to quickly grow up to protect his mother so others could not bully her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As if sensing his son's gaze, Martin Weiss's eyes fell on Nelson Corbyn. The look in his son's eyes made Martin Weiss feel a pang in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Ever since... what had happened that year, his son always looked at him with frosty eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It had never changed after all these years! He knew it was all his fault. If not for how he had treated Kyla and Nelson, his son would not be so indifferent to him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had wished many times that it never happened! He hoped he could turn back time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, parents of the children involved in the fight and teachers of the training institute ran over after hearing the commotion. They asked what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Weiss, now..." the subordinate nearby asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Call the police!" Martin Weiss spat out the words coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would not let anyone who dared to hurt his son off easily, whether they were children or adults!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla received a call from her mother, saying that her son was now in the police station giving his statement because he had gotten into another fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The police station? How did he get himself into the police station? How's Nelson? Is he hurt? Is he badly hurt?" Kyla asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He&rsquo;s been to the hospital. He only suffered skin trauma, so he's okay. The swelling will probably go down in a few days. It's just that..." Mrs. Corbyn seemed to hesitate and said, "Martin Weiss is at the police station too. Don't come over if you don't want to meet him. I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll come. There's no need to avoid him," said Kyla. Her son was in trouble, so she would go to the police station no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If Martin Weiss wanted to see her, it was pointless even if she hid in the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was just like how he had shown up unexpectedly that night. She just never told her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla hurried to the police station.</p></div>
