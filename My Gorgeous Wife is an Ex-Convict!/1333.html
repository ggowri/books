        <h1>Chapter 1332</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, a sudden feeling of panic rose in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, why did you suddenly withdraw the lawsuit? Didn't you want custody?" Paisley Daniels made a special trip to Emerald City and asked the question as soon as she saw Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been restless since he came to Emerald City. She kept feeling as if something was going to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though Kyla Corbyn was utterly lowly now, she still had a child with Martin Weiss. Their connection could not be cut off no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could never be at ease as long as she was not yet the Weiss family&rsquo;s true madam!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've made an agreement with her. She'll hand Nelson to me in three months and will never appear in front of Nelson again from then on," Martin Weiss said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was surprised and asked, "She's... not up to something, is she? Why did she surrender custody so easily all of a sudden?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Up to something...' The scene of Kyla Corbyn and the honest-looking man looking at each other warmly immediately appeared in Martin Weiss&rsquo;s mind. He immediately felt a tightness in his chest. "Enough. What could she be up to? Who is she to plot against me?" There was a hint of anger in Martin Weiss's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels knew Martin Weiss was mad when she heard this. She quickly said in a gentle voice, "Of course, she's no one. Martin, I'll be a good mother and take good care of Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at Paisley Daniels and remembered when Kyla Corbyn had come to him that night. The first thing she asked was to watch out for Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Paisley Daniels was puzzled by his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels said, "Then why don't we hold our wedding sometime in these next three months? Things are almost ready anyway. Nelson will be back in the Weiss family after the wedding, and there will be two happy events in the family. I can also help you take care of Nelson with a proper status."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was silent. It was indeed time to hold their wedding. It had been dragging on for a long time. It was just that he somehow rejected the thought of spending the rest of his life with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the one person he was supposed to spend the rest of his life with was someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell am I thinking? Do I think Kyla Corbyn is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with? How ridiculous!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss forcefully suppressed the thought he despised so much and said to Paisley Daniels, "Okay, let's get married. I'll have someone prepare it, and we'll have our families fix the date later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's face brightened up with joy, and her heart tingled with excitement. She smiled sweetly at Martin Weiss. "Martin, I'll be a good wife and a good mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'As for Kyla Corbyn... Hmph! Who is that woman to fight me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would be the Weiss family's young madam soon, while Kyla Corbyn was only a lump of mud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
