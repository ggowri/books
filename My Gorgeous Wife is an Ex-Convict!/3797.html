        <h1>Chapter 3795</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the day Mason broke up with her, Veronica hadn't seen him for the next few days. It was as if he had disappeared from her world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even though she couldn't see him, news about their relationship had spread throughout her school. Many people knew that she was the girlfriend of Mason from the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked around campus and often encountered unfamiliar people pointing and whispering about her, making her feel like her breakup with Mason was unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or maybe the whole relationship with him was unreal, like a short-lived dream, and now it was time for her to wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with you? You've been absent-minded these days. Do you have something on your mind?" her friend Shirley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica forced a reply, "Just thinking about some things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it about where you and your boyfriend are going to go on a date this weekend?" Shirley asked excitedly. "By the way, how do you and Mason usually go on dates? Is it like in TV dramas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"TV dramas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like going to a fancy restaurant, renting out a movie theater, or taking you to a mall and buying whatever you want. Or maybe taking you on a private yacht?" Shirley rattled off a bunch of scenarios she imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's previously troubled heart somehow felt a little better after hearing her friend say these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not as exaggerated as you think. It's just like a normal person's date," Veronica said. Although Mason could do all the things Shirley mentioned, they had never actually done them on their dates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like they never even thought about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, that's nice too! It looks pretty romantic in TV dramas, but sometimes it can be too much and uncomfortable," Shirley muttered. "So what are you guys planning to do this weekend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's eyes dimmed again. What weekend? She had no idea what she was going to do this weekend! She and Mason had already broken up, but she hadn't told anyone around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like... as long as she didn't say it, there was no real breakup between her and him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why aren't you talking?" Shirley asked, pressing on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica smiled lightly and lifted the corners of her lips. "This weekend, I'm going to </span><span>see him. After we meet, we'll decide what to do together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, she didn't want to break up like this, so she went to see him again, tried again, and didn't want to leave any regrets or pain like she did in the past!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to tell him how much she loved him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also believed that his feelings for her were not something he could just let go of by saying so!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had been with her since he was five years old. Those years and feelings, even if he had been hypnotized before, would eventually be imprinted on his heart!</span></p></div>
