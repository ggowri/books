        <h1>Chapter 858</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was woken up the next morning by her phone's alarm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her head was a little dizzy, and there was a sore feeling in her neck. She raised her hand and subconsciously rubbed her neck. Suddenly, as if remembering something, she froze and quickly looked around her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, everything in the room was the same as usual. Even her pajamas were intact. There was nothing unusual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to have been kissed in her sleep yesterday, and then... she passed out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I didn't see who it was, but the kiss felt like... it was Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, nothing seems to be unusual. Did I dream of him kissing me? Did I have such a dream because I haven&rsquo;t forgotten about him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes darkened, and she lifted her thin quilt before getting out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When will I be able to forget that man? I thought I&rsquo;d finally have a family, but it turned out to be just a dream.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only start over when she forgot about him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went into the bathroom, took her toothbrush and cup, and squeezed the toothpaste onto the toothbrush. She was about to brush her teeth when out of the corner of her eyes, she saw a red spot on her neck. She immediately stiffened!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's this? Is that&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She put down her toothbrush and raised her hand to touch the red spot. A moment later, her face reddened and paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's a hickey!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is there a hickey on my body?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrified, she raised her eyes and looked at herself in the mirror. Her pink lips looked particularly bright in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be that... last night's dream wasn't a dream? Could Jason have walked into my rental house and... kissed me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the idea crossed her mind, even she herself found it absurd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could Jason have done this? Besides, it's not like him! He's the one who wanted to break up, and... How could he have come over in the middle of the night to kiss me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No way!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... the hickey on her neck looked so obvious in the mirror while the feeling of having been kissed seemed to remain on her lips...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It feels so real!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla was discharged from the hospital, Grace took a day off from the law firm to help Kyla go through the discharge procedures. She then took a taxi to send Kyla back to the small restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to take the day off. My injury is almost healed. I can handle things myself," said Kyla. She had few friends and relatives in Emerald City. Furthermore, her mother had to look after Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It just so happened that Nelson had to attend a specialized training class today, so she thought she had to leave the hospital alone. She did not expect Grace to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The most fortunate thing about coming to this city was meeting Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was putting down some of Kyla's personal belongings she brought back from the hospital as she said, "No patient should leave the hospital on their own. Besides, work at the firm isn't that busy, so it's alright for me to take a few hours off work."</p></div>
