        <h1>Chapter 752</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Kyla somewhere in this night scene?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had been a nightmare, eating away at his thoughts for years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the winner, but why did he feel no joy? Every time he thought of that woman, he felt a repressed pain in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It&rsquo;s only by finding her that I can then assuage this strange feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ll find her, and this time, I'm going to banish her from my heart!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, the Reed family's driver drove Grace to the town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dressed in a black dress, Grace walked into the Lu family's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today was the 49th day after Grandma's death. The Lu family planned to make a big deal of it. They even invited Taoist priests to chant scriptures and invited many relatives and neighbors to come over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace arrived, the Lu family's house was already full of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace came to the shrine to burn incense. Looking at the black and white picture of her grandmother, her eyes could not help become watery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was someone who used to protect her the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was three to nine years old, Grandma was like her guardian&ndash;Sheltering her from the wind and rain, and putting up with all kinds of hardships to raise her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma had said, "Grace is the most promising kid. I'll wait for Grace to make a lot of money for me to enjoy a good life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, Grandma was already gone before she could let her enjoy a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that Grandma was still worried about her before she died, or she would not have asked the nurse to call her to see her one last time before she died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandma, you can rest assured that Jason will take care of me just like how you protected me. You don't have to worry about me anymore," Grace said quietly in her heart, then bowed respectfully three times before putting the incense sticks into the incense burner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">First Uncle and Second Uncle took the initiative to strike up a conversation with Grace with forced enthusiasm. They were caring and attentive to her as they spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ever since they found out that their niece's boyfriend was Jason, they had been afraid to offend her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, they were also afraid of retaliation by their niece. After all, they had once sent her to be married off to a fool before, so of course they were afraid that Jason would try to settle the score.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, they were now eagerly pleasing her in their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace entertained First Uncle and Second Uncle seeing as it was the 49th day after Grandma's death. She did not want to embarrass them and make today&rsquo;s events a flop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they chatted, the area at the doorway seemed to become lively all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up and saw several figures coming in. They were surrounded by several people. It was Third Aunt's family and... Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, Brian wore a black suit and a white shirt, making his indifferent face grow colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he looked was a far cry from the man who had dragged her into the exit passageway in the hospital and questioned her agitatedly that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if sensing her gaze, Brian's phoenix eyes darted toward her.</p></div>
