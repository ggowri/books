        <h1>Chapter 199</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone's faces changed immediately. Her third aunt directly blurted out, "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That means I'm not going to give you 200,000!" Grace coldly said, "I never said that I know any big shots. Grandmother is also your mother. You have to take care of her too. Don't you find it ridiculous to ask a maternal granddaughter like me to cover your travel fares and all of Grandmother&rsquo;s medical bills?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you're wrong to say so. Your first uncle and second uncle witnessed with their owns the big shot carrying you out of Feng's residence that day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know anything. All I remember is that I was drugged by my first uncle and second uncle," Grace said mockingly. "Maybe he was just doing me a favor. I can't stand to see people cheat their niece like this. Why don't First Uncle and Second Uncle tell me who the big shot is so that I can go and thank him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Mr. Kelleigh and his children looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know? Was that possible?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you need to pay the money no matter what. Your grandmother only got sick because you got the police to arrest your first uncle, second uncle, and third aunt," Old Mr. Kelleigh said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandfather, you're wrong to say that. I'm the victim here. The police were just doing their jobs. None of this would have happened if First Uncle, Second Uncle, and Third Aunt didn&rsquo;t conspire me to marry a fool. If Grandfather thinks I&rsquo;ve wronged them, why don't we go to the police and find out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said slowly, but Old Mr. Kelleigh's face changed. The others who had been locked up in the police station previously also trembled subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had not been easy for them to get out of there. If they went back to &lsquo;find out&rsquo;, what if they were locked up again? Only God knew when they would get out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does this mean you won't give a cent?" Old Mr. Kelleigh's face darkened. "Are you not afraid that your grandmother has no money to cure her illness and will be driven out of the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really don't want to pay the medical expenses, Grandmother still has the demolition compensation. Isn't the house going to be demolished? The house Grandfather and Grandmother live in now is a couple's joint property. Grandmother owns half of it. According to the present demolition compensation, it&rsquo;s probably worth a million. If Grandmother takes half, that's half a million. When the time comes, you can also take out a mortgage. When the demolition compensation is officially deposited, you can use it to repay the loan.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said without pausing. The Kelleigh family was going dizzy with her words, but one thing was for sure. Grace was planning to use the demolition compensation to pay the medical expenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What does the demolition money have to do with you? You're just a maternal relative. How dare you talk about this?" Her first uncle shouted at once as if Grace had come to get a slice of the cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you do know that I'm just your maternal relative? Then why do you want me to pay?" Grace said, "I will bear a quarter of my grandmother's medical expenses. I will give the money directly to the hospital, but I will not bear the rest. If you don't treat her well, I'll go to court."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying this, Grace did not bother to pay any more attention to her so-called relatives and left without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Kelleigh family looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Dad, Grace is only going to bear a quarter of the medical expenses. What about the rest?" Her first uncle asked cautiously.</p></div>
