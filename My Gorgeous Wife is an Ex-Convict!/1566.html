        <h1>Chapter 1564</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason held their son's hand while Grace held their daughter's hand. The two little ones held each other's hands. Just like that, the family of four walked into the kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch gloomily followed as she held her daughter's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the past, Irene Lynch would have wanted to be seen walking with Jason, but now she hung her head low, hoping people around her did not recognize her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch, who she led by the hand, kept staring at Jasper and Mick Reed's interlocked hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick had only held her hand one time when he first met her but never held her hand again since. She did not understand. She was much better looking than before, even wearing beautiful princess dresses. Her mother would ask the maids to do her hair in beautiful hairstyles every day, but Mick only disliked talking to her more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I'm Mick's sister too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it because I'm just an adopted daughter?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Mommy said that the little girl who fought over Jason&rsquo;s photo with me is the real daughter of the Reed family and Mick's biological sister.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When they were reaching the middle class&rsquo; entrance, Grace and Jason led their children inside. Grace talked with the teacher in charge of the middle class while Jason looked on nearby. Mick Reed dragged Jasper to the place where the children placed their school bags in the classroom. He even took the initiative to help Jasper take her school bag off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch was even more jealous when she saw this. Mick had never treated her like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew Mick first!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, can't I be Mick's real sister?" Oriel Lynch looked up at Irene Lynch and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was surprised and quickly looked around. No one was nearby, so she grabbed her daughter and whispered, "Don't say that again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why? Mr. Reed said I'm Mick's sister," Oriel Lynch said unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch whispered, "Just keep that to yourself from now on, got it? Don't argue or fight with Jasper in kindergarten. Try to avoid her. I'll make you Mick's real sister in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch looked past her daughter through the classroom window to see Grace standing next to Jason in the classroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'So what if this woman is now the mistress of the Reed family? It's been five years. If Young master Reed really had feelings for this woman, he wouldn't have let those gossips spread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Young master Reed probably only accompanied this woman to the kindergarten because of the children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If I wait patiently for my chance, I'll take her place as mistress of the Reed family one day!' thought Irene Lynch as her heart filled with jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was drawing blueprints in her architectural design office. She was in a good mood because Grace had recently come back with her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With both of them in Emerald City, it would be much easier to meet up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Five years ago, she was hospitalized because of serious injuries. Then, she got discharged and spent another year in rehabilitation before fully recovering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her boss at the architectural design office had asked her to come back to work, so she had been working there until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, her phone rang. Lina picked up the phone and heard her mother's voice coming from it. She was talking to her about blind dates and asked if she was free tonight. Her friend just happened to introduce a nice man to her.</p></div>
