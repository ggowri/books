        <h1>Chapter 3645</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before William could say anything else, Jasper directly grabbed his hand and said, "Come inside quickly, it's cold outside. Just give the car keys to the security guard at the entrance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, William didn't say anything more. After handing the car keys to the security guard, he followed Jasper into the main house of the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just sit for a while. I saw you vomit so violently earlier, but nothing came out. Your stomach must be empty. Let me get you a hot cup of milk to soothe your stomach," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He responded, "I'll do it myself." He was familiar enough with the Reed family and knew his way around the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me do it. You sit and rest!" she insisted, walking quickly into the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled. With her actions, it seemed as if he was the one injured and unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, it would indeed be better to stay here than to return to his empty villa alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least here, he wouldn't feel lonely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Jasper walked out with a cup of warm milk and handed it to William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William took the milk and took a sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it too hot?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not hot, just right," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also made some porridge for you. You can have it after you finish the milk," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He almost sprayed out the milk he hadn't swallowed yet, "You... cooked porridge?" He couldn't compliment her cooking skills, even though he loved her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still remembered back in middle school when she had the urge to cook and be a chef for a day. He didn't know how, but she managed to create something that could be called a dark cuisine and placed it in front of him and Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, they both gritted their teeth and closed their eyes, but after eating it, they ended up vomiting and having diarrhea, and had to go to the hospital. The diagnosis was food </span><span>poisoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, she hadn't really had the desire to be a chef again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his expression, Jasper rolled her eyes, "Don't worry, I ordered takeout. It will be delivered soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's takeout." He breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After you threw up like that, I won't let you go to the hospital again." She said, recalling the time when he and his older brother ended up in the hospital after eating her cooking. It was a shadow she couldn't forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered how she looked at his brother and him lying weakly in the hospital bed, hooked up to IVs. She felt sad, guilty, and remorseful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clearly her fault, so why were they the ones bearing the consequences?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like you only cooked that one time, and then never again. Lost interest?" he suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to see you guys end up in the hospital again," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one is perfect the first time. If you cook a few more times, it should get better," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to try my cooking?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly, "If you really make it, I'll eat it." Even if it's really bad, he would still eat it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you afraid of going to the hospital again?" she teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I really have to stay in the hospital, then I'll have to trouble you to take care of me," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere relaxed, and after finishing his milk, a moment later, the takeaway congee arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After William finished the congee, he and Jasper went to the guest room of the Reed family together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was quite familiar with this guest room. In the past, if he had to stay at the Reed family's place, he would usually stay in this room, where there were also some of his clothes for changing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You go back to your room and sleep first. I'll freshen up and sleep later," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, alright," Jasper responded and left the guest room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William walked into the bathroom, looking at his slightly pale face in the mirror. His appearance seemed to be a combination of his father and mother's features.</span></p></div>
