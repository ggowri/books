        <h1>Chapter 1226</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The managing director drew a long breath. After all, many strange looks had turned their way when they were standing here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The managing director and the staff then saw the man who could not be offended in the entire Emerald City taking the woman by the arm and carefully seating her on the chair. He poured a glass of water from the water dispenser and handed it to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did Master Reed... just serve water to someone else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those who knew who Jason was were dumbfounded. After all, it was normal for others to serve Master Reed water but not the other way around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took it and drank some water. Jason reached into the pocket of his suit and took out a small tin box containing preserved plums. He took one out and handed it to her. "Eat this. I heard it can stop the nausea if you have severe morning sickness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a little more comfortable as she sucked on the preserved plum. "Who told you that plums could stop nausea?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Terrence." Jason spat out a name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Terrence married?" Grace asked in surprise. Her previous impression of Terrence was that he seemed to be single.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, he said his mother threw up heavily when she was pregnant with him, but she got better after eating preserved plums," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was rendered speechless as she looked at the man in front of her. Suddenly, she wondered how two men like him and Terrence discussed the subject of morning sickness and... uh, what were the looks on their faces as they discussed the topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a little more comfortable after resting for a while, and they began to take their photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two sat together. The photographer knew Jason's identity by now, so they spoke a little more cautiously than usual. "Guys, please smile..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly whispered in Grace's ear, "Do you want me to smile?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was slightly surprised and turned to look at him. His eyes were staring at her. There was no other expression on his beautiful face. It was as if he was just asking her this in a normal way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... there seemed to be so much emotion in his eyes that Grace suddenly had an indescribable feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... want you to smile," she heard her voice mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll smile." He slowly smiled, and it was like the melting snow&mdash;so beautiful people could not look away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Click!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With the click of the camera, their photo for the marriage license was out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace took the photo from the photographer and looked at it, all she could see was that she and Jason were wearing white clothes and smiling in front of the camera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her smile was better than she had expected. At least there was nothing sad about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His smile... was so beautiful... and so bright it reminded her of the same way he had smiled when they were still together.</p></div>
