        <h1>Chapter 2972</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda bit her lip and looked up at the other person. "I don't think there's anything wrong with me using this powder, but you, criticizing others like that right off the bat, that's something only an uncivilized person would do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." the woman exclaimed in anger, "What's the matter? You can't stand being criticized for using cheap things? I wonder where you got that outfit from. Maybe you traded your body for some unspeakable deeds to get it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman turned around and walked out of the restroom with another woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda grabbed the powder compact and hurried out of the restroom, shouting "I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" The women looked at Valda with amusement, as if she were a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want you to apologize!" said Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, if someone spoke about her in this way, she might have just accepted it as bad luck and endured it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, she doesn't want to continue like this. She doesn't want anyone to throw dirt on her, but she has to endure it. If this continues, it won't just be embarrassing for her, but also for Brian and the Hart family. They will all be embarrassed together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because now, she not only represents herself, but she is also Brian's girlfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you joking about, are you crazy?" The other person spat at Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shouldn't you apologize for insulting someone in the restroom just now?" Valda said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, you mean when I said you traded your body for designer clothes? So what if I said it!" The woman said nonchalantly, along with her friends who also had a haughty expression on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since I said it, then apologize!" Valda insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ha, even if I did insult you, so what? You can change your clothes and pretend to be wealthy, but you can't fake your identity and status," the other person looked at Valda with disdain. "That's the difference between you and me. You keep apologizing here, but what can you do about it? I won't apologize, so what can you do about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda frowned, and just then, a voice rang out, "What's going on? Valda, why do you want them to apologize?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked up and saw that Brian had walked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had obviously heard some of the conversation earlier, but he wasn't sure what the argument was about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two women who were confronting Valda were taken aback when they realized that Brian knew this woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked up to Valda and naturally put his arm around her shoulder, looking down at her. "Earlier, I heard that they insulted you. Is that true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This person said some unpleasant things, so I asked her to apologize," Valda pointed to the woman who insulted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two women looked at the situation and quickly realized what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This person was clearly Brian's girlfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman who insulted Valda was both shocked and angry, and looked at Valda with indignation. "You did it on purpose, didn't you? You clearly overheard us talking about Brian's girlfriend, but you deliberately eavesdropped, just to make fun of us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's friend next to her awkwardly said to Brian, "It's just a misunderstanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person who started it all still felt like they were being played and angrily said, "What misunderstanding, Brian? Your girlfriend did it on purpose, and her taste is really bad. Look at the powder she's using, it's cheap stuff that only poor people would use. Being with someone like her will only lower your status."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, my status? What status do I have?" A dangerous glint flashed in her pitch-black eyes.</p></div>
