        <h1>Chapter 3678</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how deep Mason's feelings for Veronica are? Do you know how much I, Mason, have suffered to become like this? You know nothing, yet you say such things here. Don't you think it's ridiculous?" Jasper said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And..." She took another step forward, approaching him, "I have never played with your feelings. I have always treated you as a friend. Yes, I know I have made mistakes before, I shouldn't have ignored your explanation. But do you have no faults? Why didn't you explain everything to me before I heard your conversation with your parents? Maybe there wouldn't have been any misunderstandings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she was so emotional that her face turned red, and her beautiful almond eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger couldn't help but stare at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about yourself? Don't you think you're playing with other people's feelings?" Jasper continued, "You act intimately with those girls, you know they like you, but you still give them the wrong signals. Isn't that playing with their feelings? You can criticize others, but can't reflect on yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you want me to reflect on myself?" Roger looked at Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I want you to reflect on yourself!" She stared at him and said, "I'm glad you're alive. If you want revenge for what happened back then, you can take it out on me alone, I can bear it. But don't take it out on my family. And I have never played with you, I don't like being accused of things I didn't do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her with his black eyes, and after a moment, his voice became hoarse, "If I really want to take revenge on you, then I'm afraid the Reed family is enough to make me disappear without a trace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't let my family hurt you!" Jasper said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's eyelashes trembled slightly, "Then you tell me, how can I make up for the harm I have suffered? Do you think the only thing I have suffered is the death of my parents? Do you think a light revenge on you can really make up for everything? Jasper, you don't understand how dark this world can be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was pain and struggle in his eyes, which shook Jasper's heart. "Then you can tell me, what happened to you, what have you experienced during these years of disappearance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips were tightly pursed, his body trembling. Tell her? Tell the person he hated the most about his most embarrassing side? Those memories were so unbearable and so difficult for him to endure...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's face became increasingly pale, and his body trembled more and more violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She noticed that something was wrong with him and asked urgently, "What's wrong? Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." He gasped heavily and suddenly hugged her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was startled and instinctively wanted to struggle, but all her resistance stopped when she felt his body trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shaking like a child who was extremely scared, and this kind of Roger made Jasper feel a dull pain in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held her tighter and tighter, like a drowning person holding onto the last piece of driftwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that if he let go, he would sink completely to the bottom of the water.</span></p></div>
