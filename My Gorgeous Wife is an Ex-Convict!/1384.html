        <h1>Chapter 1383</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll try to protect you too," said Grace. Then, it was as if something had suddenly occurred to her. "You're going to do something to Atkinson Garden, so the Atkinson family sent Jennifer's photos to remind you of the old times?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glimmered a little. 'Remind me of the old times... The Atkinson family probably sent these photos not to remind me of the old times but to remind me of what had happened back then!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the airport's VIP lounge, Hadwin Stephenson silently looked at the flight ticket in his hand. 'I'm about to leave Emerald City.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had made up his mind, but the image of Lina who had her head wrapped in thick white gauze and her haggard, pale face calmly saying to him, &lsquo;I hope you get what you want&rsquo;, kept recurring to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Get what I want... Did I really get what I wanted?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Well, she's alive. She'll recover, get discharged from the hospital, and have a new, wonderful life. In a way, I did get what I wanted.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Still thinking about your ex-girlfriend?" Katherine Jackson approached Hadwin Stephenson and wrapped her hands around his arm. Half of her body was almost clinging to him. "Don't forget what you promised me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't," Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good. Lina was rescued because of me. If you want her to live, you have to pay a price, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Katherine Jackson said with a chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face was sullen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Katherine Jackson continued to say with a laugh, "Don't you think I'm much better than your girlfriend? Marry me and the Jackson family will merge with the Stephenson family. I&rsquo;ll gladly be a trophy wife and let you take charge. Isn't that what you've always wanted?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you'll be the best. No one will dare to tell you in your face that you're just a b*stard. As for your father's first wife and her two sons, they're doomed to spend their whole lives in prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina can't give you anything. The only one who can give you these things is me, Katherine Jackson. You made the wisest decision by breaking up with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each of these words seemed to prick his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson jerked away from Katherine Jackson and glared at her with scarlet eyes. "That's enough. Have you spoken enough? Katherine Jackson, you&rsquo;d better not mention the words &lsquo;Lina&rsquo; in front of me again. Otherwise, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Otherwise you'll what? Kill me?" Katherine Jackson jutted her chin proudly and said, "Hadwin Stephenson, don't forget that if I die, Lina will die too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's thin lips were pressed into a straight line. He glared at Katherine Jackson. After a long time, the words were finally squeezed out of his mouth. "If anything happens to her, I'll give my life to kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His only bottom line was Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ms. Carbyn, you're not doing very well. If you can't get a suitable liver, you may only have two to four months left to live. Once the cancer cells spread, even the right liver won&rsquo;t be of use. Are you sure you don't want chemotherapy?" Kyla Corbyn's attending doctor said, still trying to persuade her to go for chemotherapy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked calm and did not seem surprised by what the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had read through relevant forums these days and saw the posts of patients with symptoms similar to hers. She knew that there were few options for someone with a condition like hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, chemotherapy cost a lot of money. Besides, patients often remain stuck in bed after chemotherapy and they would be in the hospital most of the time.</p></div>
