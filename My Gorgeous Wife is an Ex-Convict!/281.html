        <h1>Chapter 280</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a good-looking man somewhere between a teenager and a young man. He had an androgynous face. It fit well with the feminine beauty that was now in fashion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His delicate features seemed to have come out of a painting, except that the man's thin lips were tightly pressed at the moment, and his extremely beautiful black eyes seemed to be tinged with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this man... angry?' Grace thought. Judging from the direction of his gaze, he seemed to be annoyed by...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?" Lina's voice rang in her ears, and Grace came to her senses immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What were you telling me?" Grace turned her head to look at her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said, did the doctor say when your hand might be healed?" Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"About a week, then I just have to wait for the skin to heal," Grace said. She then glanced in the direction of the strange man, but both the car and the man were gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you looking at?" Lina followed her best friend's gaze. "Is there anything on the street?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing." Grace smiled. She was probably a little paranoid... Even if the man was looking in their direction with a face seemingly full of anger, it did not mean that he was actually looking at them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, are you living with Jason now? What's going on?" Lina asked. She had wanted to ask this question ever since she called her best friend last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're... sort of living together," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;re cohabitating with him?" Lina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;cohabitating&rsquo; nearly got Grace to spit the drink out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... Not really, I'm just staying for a while. I should be able to move out once my hand gets better," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Lina frowned slightly. "Are you being forced to live with Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she thought about it, Jason was responsible for most of her best friend's miserable experiences in prison. He also had lied to her best friend later on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hated being lied to. Besides, Jason was probably a trauma she could not erase from her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace faked a light-hearted smile. "Not exactly... forced. At least I'm doing pretty well at his place. I broke my hand, so it's convenient to stay with him. Besides, he has given me a separate room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Lina had other concerns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace interrupted and said, "All right, let's move on to something else. Didn't you say that your mom has been setting you up on blind dates? Met anyone you like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't even talk about it. I'm trying to figure out a way to escape it. I'm only 27 years old, but my mother seems to think I can't get married. She said some fortune tellers say that I must get married next year, so I have to find a good match this year. I'd like to kick that fortune teller's stall," Lina said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You haven't had a crush on anyone all these years?" Grace said. Speaking of which, she did not seem to have seen Lina in love since they first met. Her hobby was probably fangirling over those celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Err..." Lina touched her nose uneasily when she mentioned this topic.</p></div>
