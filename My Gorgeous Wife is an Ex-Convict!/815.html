        <h1>Chapter 814</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz smiled like a winner while Grace was taunted by colleagues who had been enthusiastically welcoming her to the company not that long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was what she wanted to see. The more Grace was embarrassed, the more relieved she was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had not been for Grace, how could she have gotten herself fired from her previous firm and even struggled to find a job since then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A male colleague could not take it anymore and said, "What's wrong with all of you? Grace never said that she would pay for the meal. Since everyone ate the food, let's go dutch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The others were embarrassed to say anything when he put it like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was true that Grace had never said it. Besides, everyone in the room was working in the same firm. No one dared to say that they would not pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The male colleague calculated how much everyone had to pay and asked the waiter for the bill, but they were told, "Someone has already paid for it, so there&rsquo;s no need to pay any more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Everyone in the private room was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Someone has already paid for the bill? It was more than 70,000 dollars!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Could there have been some mistake on your part? No one here has paid for it," asked Andrea Schwartz.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There is no mistake." The waiter smiled and backed out of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in the room looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Paid? Who paid for it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, everyone's eyes unconsciously focused on Grace. Grace only took her bag shakily and said, "Alright... It's already been paid, so can I go now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she staggered out of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her head was feeling dizzy, so dizzy that she could not see the road ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was it... Jason who paid the bill? Only he would quietly foot a bill of more than 70,000 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'We've broken up, but unexpectedly, I still owe him.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled wryly. 'We've already broken up. I've told myself that I can only rely on myself from now on, but&hellip; Today, I repeatedly let Jason save me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked step by step. In the end, she did not even know how she got out of Drunken Days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um..." She suddenly stooped down and threw up on the side of the road.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had not eaten much that evening, so there was nothing left to vomit after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It hurts so much&hellip;' She felt dizzy and her stomach was churning. What she could see were the deep night and neon lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I drunk?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I guess so!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if she was floating, and her mother and grandmother's faces seemed to appear in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were smiling gently at her as if they were telling her to stay strong. Even if she was alone, she needed to stay strong and survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll&hellip; survive..." she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would make sure her loved ones could rest in peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, it did not matter even if she was alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It did not matter if she did not have anyone to depend on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be there for you from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There seemed to be a voice in her ear. 'Who is it? Who's speaking?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, depend on me more. I like you to depend on me. I want you to depend on me until you can't bear to leave me."</p></div>
