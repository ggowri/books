        <h1>Chapter 1568</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's more like I've never met a woman who managed to captivate my heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Captivate your heart... That feeling is very rare!' Lina could relate to that. It was just like how she fangirled after celebrities and liked many of them, but Hadwin Stephenson was the only one who captivated her heart. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since then, she had never met another person who could captivate her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's true. It's difficult to meet someone who can captivate your heart. It's even harder to meet another one if you've already met one," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman was slightly startled. "It seems you've met one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I met one," she said honestly. Although the person in front of her was her blind date, she thought of him as a friend after they began chatting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh? What was he like?" Anthony Sherman asked with some curiosity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He's a handsome man. He&rsquo;s handsome, well-behaved, and obedient." There was a slight curve on the corners of Lina's lips when she talked about Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even after breaking up, she only wanted to remember the best memories of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps it was because Anthony Sherman was approachable, or she was affected by Hadwin Stephenson's visit to Emerald City, so she needed to find someone to talk to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina even ordered a bottle of wine. She talked as she drank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman listened quietly. A while later, he stopped Lina's hand once he saw that she had drunk a little too much. "Stop drinking. You'll get drunk if you continue drinking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's not bad to be drunk," mumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's not too appropriate to get drunk in front of a man you just met, right? Aren't you afraid that I'll do something bad?" asked Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina smiled. "You wouldn't have said that if you wanted to do something bad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she stopped drinking. After all, if she were drunk, she would probably have to explain it to her parents tomorrow after she got home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Anthony Sherman was about to pay the bill, Lina insisted on going Dutch. "We're not boyfriend and girlfriend yet. We don't even know if the blind date is successful. There's no reason for you to foot the bill."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Men should pay," said Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But there's no law that states that. If you're my boyfriend, then I'll be okay with you paying. Otherwise, it's better to go Dutch first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "Aren't you afraid that we can never be a couple? Are we supposed to go Dutch whenever we come out for dinner?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We can treat each other to dinner if we become friends," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Friends?' Anthony Sherman's eyes sparkled. He did not reject Lina&rsquo;s offer to go Dutch anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman wanted to drive Lina home once they got out of the restaurant. "You're drunk and can&rsquo;t drive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina thought so too and said, "Sorry for the trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wait here for me. I'll get the car," said Anthony Sherman.</p></div>
