        <h1>Chapter 1036</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina replied, "Okay, I'll ask Hadwin to check it out. How's it going with Kyla? How's her business?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I called her this morning. She said business is slowly picking up, and no one's bothering her anymore," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good!" Lina was finally at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After dinner, Lina drove Grace back before she went to Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you feel better?" In the study, Hadwin Stephenson put down the documents he was reading and went to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine today. It's not as painful as yesterday," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned slightly. 'Does that mean she's still in pain today?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When will the pain go away?" He had never thought about the pain women suffered during their period. Now, he began to worry because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry. Usually, the pain will go away tomorrow," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Why don't I help you rub your tummy again?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought about it and agreed. 'Speaking of which, he's pretty good at rubbing my stomach!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Lina sat on the couch comfortably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Hadwin Stephenson could not help but smile and ordered the servant to make another cup of brown sugar ginger tea through the internal landline. Then, he went to Lina and sat down beside her. His long fingers touched her tummy and rubbed it gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're good. It's so comfortable to have you rub my tummy. I should have let you rub it every time I had my period before this," she said. She spoke of her period without blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was a little speechless. She was the only one who could make him do such a thing. "Did you see Grace today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "Yeah. You know what? Jason wants to get back together with Grace. Isn't it shocking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was no sign of surprise on Hadwin Stephenson's face as if he had expected it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you surprised?" Lina wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It would&rsquo;ve happened sooner or later. What's there to be surprised about?" asked Hadwin Stephenson. After witnessing Jason's attitude toward Grace, he knew that he still loved Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you know it would&rsquo;ve happened sooner or later?" Lina wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson gave a faint smile. "Otherwise, how free do you think a man like Jason is to appear in front of Grace all day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was rendered speechless. She realized she had no good comeback for that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason probably had no idea how much he loved Grace when he broke up with her," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's no use knowing now. Grace doesn't love him anymore! She never wants to get back together with him again," said Lina as she curled her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson mused and said, "I'm afraid it's not that easy. If Jason was so easy to dismiss, there wouldn't be any Master Reed in Emerald City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Worry suddenly appeared on Lina's face. "What can we do, then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We can only take things one step at a time. It's difficult to get involved in others' relationships," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, you have to help Grace if Jason bullies her," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, got it!" replied Hadwin Stephenson. Sometimes, he was a little jealous of Grace who was so important in Lina's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, there's something else. Grace is wondering if someone was behind the incident with the three thugs yesterday. Please check it out," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No problem," Hadwin Stephenson said immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Lina suddenly thought of something else. "Well... You seemed to have promised me... that striptease yesterday."</p></div>
