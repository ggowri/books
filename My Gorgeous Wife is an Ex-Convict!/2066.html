        <h1>Chapter 2064</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla exclaimed, "Martin Weiss! Why is Nelson with you? Where are you now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm showing Nelson something and will send him back later," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was silent for a moment before finally saying, "Bring Nelson back soon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After ending the call, Martin Weiss looked at his regretful son. Obviously, the little one felt that he should not have come here without permission as it had made his mother worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I want to go home!" said Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," replied Martin Weiss, not intending to keep the little one here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the car pulled up at Kyla's store, Kyla was already looking at the door. She immediately rushed forward to open the car door when she saw a car pulling up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once her son got down from the car, Kyla looked carefully at her son, afraid that he was hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did he... do anything to you?" Kyla asked her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla finally looked at Martin Weiss. "Mr. Weiss, I hope you'll let me know in the future wherever you're taking our child out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay." Martin Weiss smiled faintly. "I'll remember to call you in advance next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. 'Does that mean it will happen again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she could not refute him. After all, Martin Weiss was Nelson's father. Even though she had Nelson's custody, he still had visitation rights!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, Nelson, let's go back. Grandma made dinner. We were waiting for you," said Kyla as she took her son's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn obediently followed her into the store. Just then, Martin Weiss suddenly said, "Nelson, if you like what I showed you today and want to be strong, then I can let you learn what you saw today the next time I visit you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A flash of doubt passed Kyla's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, Kyla asked her son, "Did you follow him of your own accord today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn quietly replied in acknowledgment, but then he said, "Mommy, I... I won't do it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla stroked her son's tiny head. "He's your daddy, after all. Though I have no feelings for him, that doesn't mean I'll cut you off from him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't want him to be my daddy. I have no daddy, only a mommy!" Nelson Corbyn said sternly. After all, the bad childhood memories were too vivid in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, don't talk like that. Didn't you willingly go out with him today?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's because he..." Nelson Corbyn paused in the middle of his sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because what?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Biting his lip, he said, "That&rsquo;s because he asked me to follow him to see something and asked if I want to be strong."</p></div>
