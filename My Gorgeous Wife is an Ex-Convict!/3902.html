        <h1>Chapter 3900</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry! I...I didn't mean to, I'm sorry!" The apologetic voice was accompanied by the sound of the person approaching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick slightly turned his body again, causing the person's hand that was reaching towards his chest to awkwardly stop in mid-air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It wasn't intentional?" Mick suddenly sneered, his black eyes coldly scanning the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the girl who had previously clashed with Nancy, she should be from the Schultz family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Schultz family...was Nancy also from the Schultz family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this girl had previously insulted Nancy as a burden brought by her mother, which meant that Nancy and this person were sisters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Staying in the Schultz family, but having the surname Fowler, it was really awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I...didn't mean to." Clarissa said uneasily, feeling like she was being seen through by those black eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if her plan was already fully known by the other party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...your clothes got stained by my juice, how about this, I'll buy you a new one? If it's convenient, we can exchange phone numbers, and when I buy the new shirt, I can contact you..." Clarissa's voice became quieter towards the end, because the way the other party looked at her was like they were watching a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I need you to buy me a new shirt?" Mick said calmly, "Also, this corridor leads to the restroom, but people going to the restroom wouldn't be holding a drink, so you're not planning to take the drink to the restroom, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's face turned red and white, especially as the eyes of others around them turned towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If your scheming is only used in situations like this, then you're really stupid. Someone like you isn't qualified to ask for my contact information," Mick said before walking away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today was the day of his younger brother's wedding, and he naturally didn't want any embarrassing incidents to occur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it were any other day, he would have had someone throw this scheming woman out of the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he could say was that she should be grateful it was under these circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa stood in place, feeling embarrassed and wishing she could disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she really was scheming, how could Mick humiliate her like that? He completely disregarded the fact that she was just a girl who admired him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, she would make Mick pay for what he did!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa tightly gripped the glass in her hand, her eyes filled with hatred!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the wedding ended, Mason and Veronica finally breathed a sigh of relief after seeing off all the guests and family members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the room, there were only the two of them, and all the servants had retired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From now on, you're Mrs. Reed!" Mason said, looking at Veronica in her red and gold embroidered dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This dress was a classical style gown, different from a pure white wedding dress, and it made her look charming and beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are already several Mrs. Reeds, including my mom and our future sister-in-law. Aren't you afraid of being confused with someone else?" Veronica joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's call you the second Mrs. Reed?" Mason suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica thought for a moment and said, "It feels strange to have others call me 'Mrs.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But in the future, the household staff will need a title to address you," Mason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica considered this and asked, "Has the household decided on a title for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, they have. They will call you 'Mrs. Mason'," Mason answered.</p></div>
