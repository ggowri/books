        <h1>Chapter 1931</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina only grabbed him harder. "Hadwin, I... I have so much to tell you. Please, just give me a moment. Just a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I have nothing to say to you," said Hadwin Stephenson as he withdrew his hand from Lina's fingers. Then, he headed straight for the car waiting there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing Hadwin Stephenson open the door and about to get in, Lina instantly shouted, "Hadwin Stephenson, I love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as she said that, not only Hadwin Stephenson's men but also passersby looked over curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, what disappointed Lina was that Hadwin Stephenson still got in the car and closed the door without a word. He did not even look back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, many sympathetic eyes fell on Lina. Of course, some were laughing at her. There was even a senior executive shouting at the security guards a few steps away, &ldquo;What are you doing? Do you allow just anyone to get close to President Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guards hurriedly responded and stepped forward to pull Lina away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina staggered as she was pulled aside, but she kept staring at the car... until the car disappeared from her sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guard beside her was telling her something, but she was not in the mood to listen. The way Hadwin Stephenson looked at her and what he said to her kept recurring to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I... already prepared myself for this, didn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; She had mentally prepared herself countless times, but it still hurt when she had to face it in real life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina told herself, 'It's okay! Hadwin suffered so much more than me. What I'm experiencing might not even be a tenth of what he suffered in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Now that I've come to J City and am in the same city as him, I must fight for this relationship again. He just needs to... still love me a little. Even just a little is enough!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the car, Hadwin Stephenson had seemingly closed his eyes in exhaustion, concealing the mixed look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She's here! She has come to J City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She even shouted that she loves me just now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If she really loves me, she wouldn't have been so determined in drawing the line with me back then, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Why does she always sway my heart?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was just like when he was on his way to an important meeting the other day when his secretary suddenly told him about the explosion in Emerald City. Reporters who had learned about the explosion were already waiting downstairs at the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was just because Katherine Jackson was his ex-fianc&eacute;e.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not even think about Katherine Jackson at that time. All he could think about was her safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He even ditched the meeting and drove straight to Emerald City, where he got to the hospital she was in. He was in the car in the hospital parking lot all night. When he was sure she was safe, he let out a long sigh of relief and realized what a complete idiot he was being!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If I'm not going to have anything to do with her, why did I drive there?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I don't have to care whether this woman lives or dies, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I should stop thinking of that woman. Even though she stood in front of me and said she loves me, she has disappointed me. I was utterly disappointed the moment she said she had no regrets!'</p></div>
