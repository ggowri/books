        <h1>Chapter 3701</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See me? Why do they want to see me?" Veronica asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all because your father talked too much. He said you and Mason used to call each other brother and sister, and that Mason lived in our house for many years. But the other party didn't believe him, and now there's trouble. They insist on seeing you. Maybe we can talk to the Reed family and they can help us out. Then your father will be okay," Rosalind said, looking troubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Rosalind observed Veronica's reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They want to see me, so I'll go," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind sighed inwardly. If Veronica was willing to ask the Reed family for help, it would give people the impression that the Barlow family and the Reed family were still connected. Businessmen would naturally be willing to help the Barlow family. But Veronica's words had dashed Rosalind's best hopes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, if Veronica was willing to go, that was good enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you can't go like this. You need to change your clothes a bit, or they won't let you in," Rosalind said, instructing the driver to take them to a styling salon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica frowned, clearly not wanting to change her clothes, but also worried about her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some fussing, she changed into a white dress, tied her long hair back, and applied a light makeup. She looked completely different from when she came in, like a lotus emerging from the water, giving people a fresh and elegant feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Rosalind, her stepmother, was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All along, her stepdaughter had been plain-faced and dressed plainly, so much so that Rosalind had the impression that her stepdaughter was average-looking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unexpectedly, after a bit of dressing up, she looked extremely beautiful. It can only be said that the stepdaughter had excellent looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind took Veronica to the dinner party, and Veronica's face was full of worry. She didn't notice her stepmother's expression at the moment, but she had no worries at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at the dinner party, Veronica realized it was a five-star hotel. In a banquet hall of the hotel, Veronica saw her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Archer didn't look like he was being held hostage at all. He kept drinking with people and had a smiling face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Archer saw Veronica, he immediately waved to her and said, "Come, Veronica, let me introduce you to some people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Veronica understood immediately that she had been tricked by her father and stepmother. She spoke up and said, "I have something else to do. I'll leave first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could turn around, her stepmother had already grabbed her and said, "Since you're here, why leave so soon? Let your dad introduce you to some people. Young people should make more friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie Rosalind, you should know that I don't want to make any friends here. If you don't want to embarrass everyone, you'd better let go." Veronica whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Auntie Rosalind's face changed slightly, and then she whispered in Veronica's ear, "Veronica, it's not that Auntie Rosalind wants to make things difficult for you. The other party really wants to meet you. Your dad is relying on this business deal. If this deal falls through, the Barlow family may go bankrupt. Your dad has borrowed a lot of money over the years. Do you really want to see him being forced to live in poverty by his creditors?"</span></p></div>
