        <h1>Chapter 1155</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick sneered, "What do you think I need you to do? Since you&rsquo;ve set your heart on setting Jason up, you should've expected the consequences of your failure!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick shook off the woman's hand as he spoke and left the private room, ignoring everything there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian drove Grace back to her rental house. On the way back, he said, "If Patrick comes giving you trouble again, just give me a call."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent for a moment before she said, "You... could have woken me up... on the bus yesterday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "You saw the video? I saw that you were asleep and thought I might as well let you sleep for a while. But what I didn't realize was that someone had taken a video of us and even posted it online. If you don't like it, I can have it taken down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was always wary of those candid cameras, but yesterday on the bus, he had been so focused on her that he did not pay attention to his surroundings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only fallen asleep on the bus for half an hour, but he was content for every minute and every second of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even wanted to thank the person who took the video from the bottom of his heart for leaving him such a memory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw himself in the video, he could not help but wonder how long it had been since he was so content. He was just watching a woman sleeping with her head down, but he could not look away and wanted to keep looking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then please have the video taken down," said Grace. She did not enjoy having her videos posted online. It felt like everyone was watching her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace's phone rang. The caller ID showed that it was Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace answered it and heard Kyla Corbyn's slightly bitter voice on the phone. "Grace, can you transfer me 2,000 dollars on your phone now? It's... It's urgent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? What happened?" Grace could tell that there was something seriously wrong with Kyla Corbyn&rsquo;s voice. She seemed to be speaking in a heavy nasal voice. It was as if she had a lump in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... need to go through the hospitalization procedures for Nelson. The deposit is currently 2,000 dollars short. I can only transfer the money out from the bank during the day," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. "Is Nelson being hospitalized? Why is he hospitalized? Wait, tell me which hospital you're in. I'll come over right now. I'll transfer you the money on my phone now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ended the call after keeping the hospital name Kyla Corbyn told her in mind. Brian, who had also heard the conversation, said, "You want to go to City First Hospital, don't you? I'll send you there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Grace. Then, she quickly transferred 2,000 dollars to Kyla Corbyn on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was worried about Nelson on the way to the hospital. When she arrived at the hospital, she said to Brian, "Thank you for taking me to the hospital. Sorry for the trouble." With that, she hastily opened the car door to get out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian immediately grabbed Grace's hand. "If there's anything you need, just let me know. I'll help you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave Brian a deep look and smiled. "Thank you!" She rushed into the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Grace's back until she disappeared from his field of vision. He slowly raised his hand and gently kissed the palm that had just held her hand. It was as if the warmth of her hand was still there.</p></div>
