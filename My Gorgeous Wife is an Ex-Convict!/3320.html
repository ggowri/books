        <h1>Chapter 3318</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, the Wilona couple can no longer sit still. They have a vague understanding of what's going on. Wilona even wants to open the car door and jump out, but she realizes that the door is already locked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop the car, quickly stop the car!" Wilona and Doran shouted loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver finally spoke in a relaxed tone, "It's only right to pay back what you owe. Running away like this goes against the rules of the road."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Abbott couple looked panicked. Even though they may not be the brightest, they understood what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence tightly held the small house in his arms, with a look of fear on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the car stopped in a dark alley, and the driver turned to the Abbott family and said, "Okay, get out now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Abbott family, consisting of three people, trembled as they got out of the car. Waiting for them were a group of fierce and menacing beings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence only saw his parents and knelt in front of those people, repeatedly kowtowing and begging for mercy, hoping that they would spare his parents this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But those people had cold and indifferent expressions on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man in charge, with a cold and indifferent tone, said, "I only care about whether you can repay the money or not. If you can repay it now, then we can let you go. But if you can't repay it, then you'll have to beg Lord Yan. I can't break the rules for you. Otherwise, everyone will know that they can borrow money from me and run away, and how can I continue to work with my brothers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Repay the money? Wilona and Doran don't have the money to repay it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hemming and hawing for a while, they also exhausted the other party's patience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man in charge said directly, "Done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, Lawrence saw those people coming at him with knives, attacking his parents directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The parents were running away, and at this moment, the father was still protecting the mother, holding onto the person with a knife with all his might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the mother was holding his hand, running desperately towards the end of the alley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The small house he was tightly holding onto in his hand... has already fallen, and his wrist has also been cut, it hurts a lot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So painful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they ran out of the alley, he only heard his mother say, "Don't look back!" He was stunned for a moment, and then his mother pushed him into a small river next to the mouth of the alley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He fell into the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His swimming skills have always been good, he knows how to swim well. He understands that his mother wants him to swim away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, he heard someone shouting, "That kid fell into the river!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then came the mother's loud cries for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the cry for help from the mother abruptly stopped!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's heart kept sinking, he understood that his mother might have encountered some unexpected situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he can only keep swimming without knowing where to go, but only to stay alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, he was rescued by a pleasure boat. There was a doctor aunt on the boat who helped him bandage his injured hand. Someone asked him what had happened and why he fell into the water and got hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence was still in shock as he spoke about his parents being attacked with a machete. However, he couldn't quite remember where the alleyway was located. He could only describe some of the prominent buildings he had seen along the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone helped him make a phone call to report to the police.</p></div>
