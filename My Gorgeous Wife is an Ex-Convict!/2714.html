        <h1>Chapter 2712</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt an emptiness in her hand. Some people would not stay no matter how much she tried to keep them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled bitterly. Moments later, she got up and walked out of the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she walked out of the hall, she saw Martin Weiss on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I see. I'll go back right now." Martin Weiss put away the phone after he was done speaking. He turned around to see Kyla standing behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes sparkled slightly, and he said, "We have to stop our date here. I have to go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did something happen?" Kyla asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's something I didn't want to attend, but... my mother insists that I attend. I'm afraid I won't get back to the mansion until very late," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he wanted to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She grabbed his arm immediately. "Do you have to attend it today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her. "Yes. I can make up the rest of the time for you if you don't think you haven&rsquo;t had enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt a pang in her heart. 'Make it up to me? That sounds like a business deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, today is a deal. I exchanged a day with him for my agreement to divorce him.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "I'll go back with you. As for the rest of the time... You don't have to make it up to me. I'll sign the divorce papers after midnight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her with slight surprise. Moments later, he said indifferently, "Whatever floats your boat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They left the movie theater and got into the car. When they reached the mansion, they saw Mrs. Weiss and Shana Nicholls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls was in a fancy dress and elaborate makeup. She looked as if she was going to attend a banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Mrs. Weiss saw Martin Weiss, she said, "I asked Nurse Ruan to go to the banquet with you. She'll be there to take care of you if something goes wrong with your body."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned slightly, and Mrs. Weiss said, "You know today's banquet is to end all those rumors about your health. I'll feel better if Nurse Ruan is with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pondered for a moment before tacitly accepting Mrs. Weiss's arrangement. "I'll go change my clothes." With that said, he went up the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Mrs. Weiss, Shana Nicholls, and Kyla were the only ones left in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss looked at Kyla and said, "I heard you went out with Martin today. I thought you would care about Martin's health. He's not in the condition to run around outside for a long time. You don't care about Martin at all. If you drag him around outside again the next time, I'll..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There won't be a next time," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean there won't be a next time?" Mrs. Weiss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm signing the divorce papers and returning to Emerald City tomorrow." Kyla smiled faintly and said, "I don't think I'll be back very often, so you have nothing to worry about anymore, Aunt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss froze, not knowing what to say all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls's face lit up with joy as soon as she heard that. 'Kyla's divorcing Mr. Weiss? Besides, she's returning to Emerald City and won't come to L City again. That&rsquo;s great!'</p></div>
