        <h1>Chapter 1070</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because I can't tolerate her doing such a menial job?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, I shouldn't 'tolerate' her! She's not worthy of me &lsquo;tolerating&rsquo; her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm only getting you a job for Nelson's sake. I don't want my son to suffer too much before the case is over," said Martin Weiss. He said this to remind Kyla Corbyn and himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said coldly, "He's my son, not yours! Mr. Weiss, don't forget that you once said that even if I were really pregnant, you would ask me to abort the child. You said a woman like me has no right to give birth to your child. So what makes you think you can take away my child now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened. He approached Kyla Corbyn step by step and said, "You should have thought of such a day when you chose to give birth to this child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She trembled suddenly. "You wouldn't even let the child you don't want stay with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said unceremoniously, "What chance do you think he'll have if he stays with you? Will he set up a stall with you in the future and have everyone mock him for having an ex-convict as a mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face immediately paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice continued, "I'll take him back to S City when this case is over. Paisley will treat him like her own. He'll have a bright future. What can you offer him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's lips trembled as if to say something, but she said nothing after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just silently turned around and somewhat staggered onto her motorcycle. She was only a little over 30 years old, but she seemed overwhelmed and there was an air of old age all over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She slowly started the motorcycle, and it sounded out a &lsquo;toot toot&rsquo; before going down the quiet road.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss felt a sudden regret washing over him as he looked at the disappearing motorcycle stall. She seemed empty after hearing his words. It was as if his words had crushed her soul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart was aching again. 'It seems to hurt... more than before&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt like she was going crazy. According to the surveillance records Hadwin Stephenson found, Jason's car never appeared near Reed Residence that night. In other words, Jason never brought Grace back to Reed Residence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car Jason was riding in ended up somewhere in the west of tMason Swansonty. After that, surveillance records along the way were destroyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, they had no way to find out where Jason took Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you can't find her?" Lina asked Hadwin Stephenson as she would not give up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson smiled wryly. "Emerald City is Jason's territory. If he doesn't want people to find him, then I have no way to do so either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Emerald City was not within the Stephenson family's control, and there was a limit to what he could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's expression immediately sank. "What should I do? I still can't get through to Grace's phone. I've also checked with her office. They said she has asked for leave. She's also not in the rental house! What will Jason do to Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry too much. After all, Jason loves Grace. Even if he plans to do something to Grace, he won't hurt her. Besides, we're not the only ones looking for Grace. Brian is probably looking for her too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Brian!" Lina's eyes lit up immediately. "Let's find Brian and see if he has found Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without delay, Lina grabbed Hadwin Stephenson and headed toward Hart Group&rsquo;s building.</p></div>
