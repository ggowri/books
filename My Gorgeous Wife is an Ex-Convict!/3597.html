        <h1>Chapter 3595</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let's go have lunch first. We haven't eaten since we got off the plane," William checked the time and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although we had airplane food on the plane, it's already 2 pm now, so it's more like afternoon tea than lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let's go to Deer Tower!" Jasper suggested. It's a well-known restaurant in Deer Capital that serves local specialties. She visits Deer Capital every year and usually eats at Deer Tower a few times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay," William replied with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two of them arrived at Deer Tower and chose a window seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper doesn't like to sit in a private room when she comes here. She says it feels too stuffy and prefers to eat in the lobby where she can look around and find it quite interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">William ordered the dishes, knowing Jasper's taste well, and chose the ones she liked to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment, the dishes arrived and Jasper was eating when she suddenly noticed William's gaze through the floor-to-ceiling window next to them, looking outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong? What are you looking at?" She followed his gaze but saw nothing special outside, just pedestrians, vehicles, and two elderly scavengers rummaging through the trash cans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Nothing!" William quickly replied. "Let's eat, or the food will get cold."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He lowered his head and ate the food, trying to hide his panic at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without much thought, Jasper continued eating.</p></div>
