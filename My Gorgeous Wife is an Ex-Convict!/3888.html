        <h1>Chapter 3886</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To get to the studio and makeup artist, they just needed to walk through a corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Along the way, Veronica couldn't help but glance at Mason. Today, even though he only had light makeup on, he looked especially handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was because his bangs were combed back, revealing his full forehead, and he was wearing a suit, making him look more mature than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His handsome eyebrows, paired with his sharp nose and chiseled face, along with his sexy thin lips, made him look good no matter how you looked at him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Is there something wrong with my face?" Mason's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's eyes suddenly met his narrow and deep gaze, and his handsome face was suddenly right in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, no...nothing's wrong!" she quickly said, but her face couldn't help but turn red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? " Mason narrowed his eyes and leaned closer to Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really, there's nothing!" she awkwardly said, especially since there were other people following them. But seeing that the person in front of her seemed to want an answer, she could only say, "I just think you look really good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good-looking?" Mason pondered, "Do you like me dressed like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... um, you usually look very beautiful, but today and the usual feeling is a bit different," Veronica whispered, urging, "Okay, let's go, the photographer is still waiting!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did Mason continue walking with Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at the studio, the photographer was already waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All the props were already prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After posing a few poses as requested by the photographer, he let the two of them do as they pleased while he captured the shots from the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you tired?" Mason asked Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not really," she replied, "just my feet are a bit sore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your feet hurt?" He was taken aback and glanced at her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But because her long wedding dress covered her feet, he couldn't see them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wore high heels today. I rarely wear high heels, so if I stand for a long time, my feet will get sore," Veronica explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then sit down for a moment, let me take a look," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But we're still taking pictures now, aren't we?" she asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just pause for a moment," Mason said, gesturing to the photographer to pause, and then pulled Veronica to sit on a nearby chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The chair was originally a prop in the studio. Veronica sat on the chair, and Mason crouched in front of her, slightly pulling her skirt to reveal the pair of high heels she was wearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are the heels so high?" Mason frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because there's a bit of a height difference between us, if the heels weren't a bit higher, the photos wouldn't look good," Veronica explained quickly. "They let me choose the shoes, and I thought it would be better to go with higher heels."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, it was a once-in-a-lifetime wedding photo shoot, and she always hoped to look better and strive for perfection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pursed his lips and helped her take off her high heels, his fingers gently massaging her feet. "Does that feel more comfortable for your feet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt a bit embarrassed, but she had to admit that Mason's massage was just right. Her sore feet felt much better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the problem was...there were still many other people around! It was like he was massaging her feet in front of everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And yet, he was so natural about it that the awkwardness only seemed to affect her.</p></div>
