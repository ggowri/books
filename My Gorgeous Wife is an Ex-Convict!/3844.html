        <div><span>.</span><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hates!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what he hates even more is his own contradiction! Even so, he still wants to meet her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if all she gives him is pain, he still clings to this pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sense of powerlessness makes him even more uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, this person who makes him feel conflicted and powerless is right in front of him. If he gets closer, he can kiss her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those lips seem to have some kind of magic, attracting him to touch them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wants to possess her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she doesn't have any feelings for him, he still wants to possess her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a pair of hands lifted up and pressed against his chin, stopping him from getting closer. "Lawrence, what do you want to do? I don't have those kinds of feelings for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you don't have those feelings, it doesn't mean we can't kiss, right?" Lawrence said. "Imagine if that thing didn't happen back then, and we grew up together. If you continued to like me, maybe you and I would be together now instead of you and William. In that case, isn't it natural for us to kiss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still remembers the feeling of kissing her, even though she was unwilling and struggling at the time. But he can't forget that wonderful feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because he can't forget, he wants to experience it again even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible. Even if we grew up together, I would still love William," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her denial made Lawrence's eyes even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, he forcefully pulled her hands away and leaned down to try to kiss her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lawrence... don't do this!" Jasper avoided his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I want to!" he insisted. He wanted to kiss her and prove that she still had feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was she so determined to say that even though they grew up together, the person she loved was William? She clearly liked him so much back then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did she know, he had been comforting himself with these assumptions for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper kept dodging, but now Lawrence had grabbed her hand and pressed her body against his. Even though she tried to move her head left and right, she couldn't really escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as his lips were about to touch hers, suddenly, the sound of the lab door opening rang out, followed by hurried footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jasper could react, a force had pulled her away and a fist swung towards Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper only saw Lawrence stumble backwards, and she was free from his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, are you okay?" William asked nervously, holding onto her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm fine," Jasper gasped, only then realizing that William had entered the lab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another person had entered the lab with William, someone who clearly knew Lawrence. Seeing Lawrence being pushed back, he hurried over and asked, "What's going on between you and Jasper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at the person, she didn't know him, but he accurately called out her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't surprising, after all, at Stanford University, many people knew her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Reed family's name was too famous, and as soon as she entered campus, she became a celebrity because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're just catching up. Jasper and I have known each other since we were kids, we have a deep history," Lawrence explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is that so? The person seriously doubted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened the door just now, he looked like he was about to force a kiss.</span></p></div>
