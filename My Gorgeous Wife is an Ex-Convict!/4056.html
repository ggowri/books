        <h1>Chapter 4054</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? You've been staring at me." Chandler's voice suddenly sounded, bringing Tina back from her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina smiled awkwardly, realizing that she was currently eating with Chandler in a restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was just thinking about how handsome my fianc&eacute; is," she flattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler raised his eyebrows, "What else do you need me to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "..." She gave him a speechless expression, "I really mean it from the bottom of my heart! I'm not just saying nice things to ask for your help!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Is that so?" He smiled faintly, every time she asked for his help, she would speak sweetly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes." She said, and then seemed to think of something, "By the way, can I stay overnight at your place tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why do you suddenly want to stay overnight at my place?" Chandler asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although Tina occasionally stayed overnight at his place, it was usually when the Stephenson family was not at home, or when she dragged him to accompany her to concerts or events that ended too late, so they would stay at his place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And today, obviously none of these situations existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's just...there's a game tonight for my favorite team, and I want to watch it with you, so I thought I could stay overnight at your place. You wouldn't refuse your lovely fianc&eacute;e, would you?" She even blinked her eyes deliberately and put on a pitiful look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Have you talked to your parents about it?" Chandler asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If you agree, I'll tell them right now!" She said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He sighed, "When have I ever refused your requests?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He could be said to be very indulgent towards her, so much so that even those who knew him well found it strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Some people even asked him privately, why he was so devoted to Tina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, although she was not bad-looking, she could not be considered a beauty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although she had the background of the Stephenson family, her unconventional personality also made many elders of wealthy families shake their heads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He himself found it strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it was fate that made him choose her, who had just been born, and engage with her, then his feelings for her slowly accumulated over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was when she was still a baby, holding his finger and smiling at him, or maybe it was when she was learning to speak and calling out to him, "Chandler... Chandler..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or maybe it was when she slept in his arms, full of trust...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even he couldn't explain when his feelings for her started to grow, or even change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for him, it was a good thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person he fell in love with was the one he was destined to be with!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina called the Stephenson family to let them know she would be staying overnight at Chandler's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina agreed, reminding her daughter not to make a mess or cause trouble for Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina promised, not mentioning her true intentions for staying the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, if her parents found out, they would drag her back home by the ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ending the call, Tina smiled at Chandler, "Now you can stay over there tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other end, Lina told her husband, "Tina is staying overnight at Chandler's place tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Staying overnight? Why?" Hadwin frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "She said that her favorite team is playing tonight and she wants to watch the game with Chandler," Lina said.</p></div>
