        <h1>Chapter 1911</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The atmosphere immediately changed. Even the air seemed to be filled with tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The mercenaries' expressions changed as well. They tried to rush forward to subdue Katherine Jackson. After all, they had to rely on Grace to keep their lives and get the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Katherine Jackson would not let them get close to her. She dragged Grace to the edge of the rooftop. "I'll slash her if anyone comes near. The worst thing is her losing her life. It's not bad of a deal if I can have the mistress of the Reed family die with me. I just don't know if Emerald City's Young master Reed can give up his wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked at Katherine Jackson coldly, his face seemingly covered with frost. He walked toward Katherine Jackson step by step. "Then you can try and see if I'm willing to give her up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson was a little flustered as she watched Jason approach her. "Don't come over. I won't go easy on her if you come over!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As Katherine Jackson finished speaking, the dagger in her hand left a bloody streak across Grace's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace let out a low cry of pain as blood trickled down her neck to the hem of her shirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's expression only changed slightly. It was just that the hands dangling at his sides were clenched tighter and tighter, revealing his current mood. "At this point in time, you should be thinking of how to negotiate with me instead of dragging her to die with you. Katherine Jackson, I can let you leave with these people, give you a car, and let you leave Emerald City, but... you can&rsquo;t cause any more harm to my wife.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason told her his conditions, and his cold voice was like the devil's temptation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It seems that Grace is really important to you, Young master Reed," said Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She's my wife. I must protect her, of course," Jason said nonchalantly as if everything he was doing right now was just because of his obligations as a husband. He seemed to be silently letting Katherine Jackson understand that it was useless to threaten him with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is that so? Let's see how you plan to protect Grace, Young master Reed!" said Katherine Jackson as the dagger cut Grace's neck again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The first cut on her slender neck had not stopped bleeding when there was a second cut. The wounds bled non-stop!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason frowned. "Katherine Jackson, you're looking for trouble. You can never leave Emerald City if you dare hurt her again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Haha. Jason, I don't believe you'll let me leave Emerald City. Besides, now that the Jackson family has turned out like this, what does it matter even if I can escape Emerald City? I'd rather do something great than spend the rest of my life being a loser!" A sinister smile flashed across Katherine Jackson's face. "Won't it be breaking news if I die with the mistress of the Reed family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's expression turned ghastly. Katherine Jackson had lost her mind. He could lure normal people with various conditions, but he could not do the same with someone insane. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina shouted to Katherine Jackson, "Isn't it me you want to deal with? Let Grace go. Keep me hostage if you want to! Grace has nothing to do with our feud!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson sneered at Lina. "If Hadwin Stephenson were here, I would hold you hostage, but Jason is the one here now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she spoke, she dug her nails into the wound on Grace's neck. Intense pain instantly swept Grace.</p></div>
