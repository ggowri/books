        <h1>Chapter 852</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a pause to Jason&rsquo;s movements as his face darkened little by little. Meanwhile, Terrence was in a state of panic while wishing to sew Lina's mouth shut immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The name Grace was now taboo in Reed Group!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But now that audacious Lina is speaking so loudly of it!' Terrence was really afraid that his boss would lose his temper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air pressure around Jason seemed to have dropped a lot, and Terrence, who was beside Jason, was close to trembling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Lina was done saying her piece, she took Hadwin's arm and left contentedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin looked at his girlfriend's petty move and unconsciously laughed. 'Looks like it's true that women and petty people are difficult!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina has both characteristics!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the corner of his eyes, Hadwin once again glanced at Jason who was not far away before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does Jason really not love Grace anymore? Did they break up because he's sick of her and wants to stop dating Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin had been skeptical about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he had seen how Jason behaved in front of Grace. Jason really treasured Grace back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could he give up a woman he treasured so easily?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, Lina had even slapped Jason the last time. It was because of Grace that Jason did not pursue the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How much space does Grace occupy in Jason's heart?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Hadwin and Lina left, Terrence could not resist saying, "Master Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go," Jason coldly spat out two words before resuming walking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he got into the car and Terrence was about to drive back to the office, he heard his boss' voice from the back seat of the car. "Find out where she is now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She?' Terrence was shocked. Even though the boss only used the word &lsquo;she&rsquo;, he was sure that Master Reed was referring to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," responded Terrence as he dialed a number on his phone to use his connections at hand to find out where Grace was at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During this process, Jason just leaned on the back of the seat with his eyes lowered. There was no expression on his handsome face, which made it hard to figure out what he was thinking about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A moment later, Terrence was done giving instructions and turned to Jason, saying, "Master Reed, I've already told them what to do. I'm afraid it'll take some time to get the results. Do you want to go back to the office now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, let's just wait here for the results," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence replied and looked up at his boss. Master Reed was like a statue with some kind of coldness all over his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that Master Reed was triggered by what Lina just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed had not gotten over Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why would he break up with her if he can't get over her?' Terrence did not understand but he did not dare to ask because... it was taboo!</p></div>
