        <h1>Chapter 975</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No way!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, are you kidding me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; I&rsquo;ll never joke about things like this!" He looked up, taking her face in his hands while staring at her. "Grace, I really am in love with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were wide with surprise and disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Also in disbelief was Stella who had followed Brian here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had heard from the road surveillance team that the car ended up in front of the police station and all the people on board had gotten down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without waiting for the phone call to end, he was already in a hurry to get to the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not catch up with his ride and could only quickly take a taxi to the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect to see such a scene upon her arrival!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian&hellip; said that he loves Grace! How could he love Grace? He should love me&mdash;Stella!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'There are a lot of people on the internet who think I'm his girlfriend, and with a little more effort, I can get him to admit my status as his girlfriend publicly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, now&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella stared at Grace with jealousy in her eyes. She felt as if Grace was trying to take away her bright future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, I can't just sit here and do nothing. I must stop her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Stella was about to speak, a figure suddenly passed behind her, heading straight in the direction of Grace and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was stunned, then her pupils shrank. 'It's&hellip; It's Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was Jason here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason approached them, Brian seemed to notice something and raised his head to look at the man. Instantly, the two men's eyes met in mid-air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was facing Jason with her back to him, so she did not see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I don't care whether you were joking. I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had barely finished when he interrupted her. He lowered his head with his lips close to her ear. He laid one hand on her shoulder and put his arm around her waist, forbidding her to push him away. "Let me be very clear, Grace. I really am in love with you, so I won't let go anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kept his gaze on Jason when he said this. He was telling her this as well as the other man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, he had repeatedly ignored the throbbing in his heart because of Jason and let her go countless times. However, he would not let go again this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason heard Brian's words, and his expression immediately changed. His whole body sent out a biting chill while his peach blossom eyes were full of anger. There was also... a faint hint of panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he reached out and pulled the thin body out of Brian's arms.</p></div>
