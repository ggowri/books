        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley paused, turning around in surprise </span><span>when she</span><span> s</span><span>aw</span><span> </span><span>Lornell coming out of the car and </span><span>walking towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you..." she was a bit confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weren't they supposed to pretend they didn't know each other? Why was he taking the initiative to greet her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came here today specifically to find you. Are you planning to ignore me and leave?" Lornell walked up to Harley and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're looking for me?" she blinked, not quite understanding</span><span> what was going on</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her bewildered expression, furrowing his brow slightly, and grabbed her wrist. "Get in the car, let's leave this place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he didn't have time to explain here and be watched by the people around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was led into the car by Lornell, and the car quickly left the school gate, leaving behind a crowd of onlookers still marveling at the scene that just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Harley was known as the princess of the school's entertainment circle</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hart family owned half of the national film and television industry, and her father, Brian Hart, could almost be called the emperor of the entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were rumors that because </span><span>Harley</span><span> </span><span>liked a star</span><span> when she was a child</span><span>, that star received resources that would be almost impossible to obtain in this lifetime</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>J</span><span>ust </span><span>because of her words, </span><span>he got</span><span> </span><span>famous nationwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One </span><span>c</span><span>ould</span><span> </span><span>imagine the position the Hart family held in the entertainment industry. Therefore, many stars wanted to get to know this little princess of the Hart family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if they were lucky enough to be noticed by the little princess, they would have a smooth sailing-career in the entertainment industry, gaining both fame and fortune</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could that person just now be some kind of celebrity?" someone speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unlikely, most celebrities can't afford such a car." someone else said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be a</span><span>n heir</span><span> of some wealthy family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if a wealthy heir like that is so handsome, they would have been trending already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various discussions were going on, while Harley sat in Lornell's car, trying to guess why he suddenly came to her school today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see me in the restaurant at lunch today?" Lornell asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Harley replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you say hello?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your classmates were there, it wouldn't have been appropriate for me to approach and greet you," Harley explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's inappropriate about it?" he countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment, then bit her lip lightly. "Alright, I understand. Next time I see you, I'll come and say hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't mention their engagement and just introduced herself as his friend, she should be able to greet him.</span><span> </span><span>He probably meant that too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, how did you end up with Tina?" Lornell asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so strange about me being with Tina?" Harley retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She lost her memory, so you shouldn't have any connection with her. Isn't it strange that you had a meal with her at the restaurant?" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina asked me out for a meal today and asked me some questions about your family," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My family?" Lornell raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She asked if I knew anything about the Quentin family, and I just mentioned some things that everyone knows. But later on, we talked about recovering her memory. Oh, by the way, can the Quentin family help Tina recover her memory?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell pondered for a moment and said, "If there is a forceful stimulation, perhaps </span><span>it</span><span> will be</span><span> </span><span>possible."</span></p></div>
