        <h1>Chapter 3126</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Warm tears fell onto her hand along with his kiss, causing a wave of heartache in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How much does this man really love her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't cry. If the waiter comes in with the food in a little while, they might think I bullied you," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I won't cry," murmured Brian, "but you're the only one who can bully me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A moment later, when the waiter brought the dishes in, the man's eyes were red and the woman was saying, "Okay, I promise I won't do this again next time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What do you mean by "not anymore"? The waiter's mind was suddenly filled with various thoughts, until the man's cold gaze swept over, and the waiter quickly put down the plate in his hand and walked out in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda said, 'You seem to have scared the waiter.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian said, "You said it before, no backing out. You will be my wife for the rest of your life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I won't regret it. I'm not a three-year-old child!" Valda said, raising her hand and touching his face again. "Brian, I don't know what our future will be like. Maybe my limp leg will make you face a lot of ridicule and criticism. People will say, 'How could the great Brian, the prince of the entertainment industry, marry a cripple as his wife?'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No one dares to say such things!" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if they don't say it to your face, they'll say it behind your back," Valda said. "These criticisms are unavoidable, but... I don't want to be a coward. I will try to become better and make others see that even if I have a limp, I'm not that bad. I will stand by your side if you don't let go, I won't give up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face was full of determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took the hand that was pressed against his cheek and brought it to his heart, leaned over, and whispered, "Valda, I will never let go, so you can never give up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her dark pupils reflected his handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she said, her lips slightly parted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next moment, his lips landed on hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was their vow, and this kiss was their vow of commitment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">***</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing lunch, Brian accompanied Valda to repair her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you need to go back to the company? Actually, I can go fix the phone by myself," Valda said, afraid of delaying his work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian said, "I'll accompany you. If there's anything urgent at the company, the secretary will call me. Where did you get your phone repaired?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda gave the address for the phone repair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian drove and took Valda to their destination. The storefront was located along the street and was easy to find.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's phone wasn't ready for pick up for another 2 hours, so she decided to take Brian for a walk around the area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're tired, just let me know and we can find a nearby place to rest for a bit," said Brian. He knew that Valda had difficulty walking and that walking long distances could easily tire her out more than the average person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I understand now," said Valda, linking her arm with Brian's. "It's just that I walk a bit slower, so please be patient with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It doesn't matter how slowly you walk, I'll be by your side," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt reassured by the simple sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like she doesn't have to be afraid of anything as long as he's by her side. I don't have to worry even if I'm very busy.</p></div>
