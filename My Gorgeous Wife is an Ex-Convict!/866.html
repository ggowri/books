        <h1>Chapter 865</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you get this..." she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled a little, and it was as beautiful as springtime in the mountains. However, the more beautiful the smile, the more daunting it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why shouldn't I have this?" he asked with amusement as if she had asked a silly question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'That&rsquo;s right. Since he can sit in my house and wait for me to return, getting hold of a video like this is naturally a breeze.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she did not even notice that someone was secretly filming her and Chase Harper today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this the only part of the video? Or had he been keeping watch of my entire trip to the amusement park with Chase Harper and Nelson today?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her scalp tingled at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? What you're doing now is a violation of human rights!" Grace criticized him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, no one wanted to live under surveillance, and she had already broken up with him. She had no idea why he would do that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smirked as he stood up and approached Grace. "Is that so? What about you? Why did you go to the amusement park with Chase Harper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whoever I go to the amusement park with is up to me," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's up to you?" he sneered. Suddenly, he raised his hand and grabbed her jaw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go." She tried to pull his fingers away, but they did not even budge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly bent down, pressing his cheek lightly against hers. He rubbed her slightly cold cheek, then said nonchalantly, "Do you think it's up to you if I won't allow it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Grace felt a chill running down her spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does he mean by that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he rubbed against her cheek was still very gentle. It was just like how he used to hold her in his arms and rub against her cheek like he had endless love and longing for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she found it sweet. She even thought that he was behaving like a loyal puppy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his actions and his words now only made her feel colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your face feels a little cold. Are you afraid?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, what do you want?" she asked, taking a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cheek finally left her face. His bright eyes stared at her, and without answering, he asked, "Do you like Chase Harper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was surprised. The question was baffling. "Whether I like him or not is none of your business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I need to know the answer?" His eyes seemed to entrap and imprison her, making her unable to break free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We broke up. It's none of your business who I like, isn't it? You have no right to ask even if I do like Chase Harper!" Grace said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her words seemed to trigger him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm the one you like!" When he finished speaking, his lips pressed hard against hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mhm&mdash;" Grace made a conscious attempt to turn her head away, but his fingers grabbed her chin so tightly that she could not avoid the kiss at all.</p></div>
