        <h1>Chapter 1883</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "Grace, do you really think you can recklessly hurt me just because I love you? Do you know that you're the first person to drug me and stand before me unharmed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What he said made her feel utterly embarrassed. "I... I admit I did it because you love me, but I just didn't want things to get to the point that it would be irreversible. I didn&rsquo;t want you to do anything you'd regret. Jay, will killing your own mother and having her punished make you happy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He suddenly pushed her against the wall nearby. Then, he leaned over and breathed in her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What makes you think I'll regret it? Do you think you're a fighter for justice because you've been a lawyer for a long time? How do you know I won't be happy doing all that?" he asked with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you know how I felt when I drank the bowl of vegetable beef soup you made when you wanted to drug me? Do you know how I wished you had never shown up at the freeway? Grace, I gave you so many chances, yet you still drove your car toward me in the end. When I let you pass, I told myself that I won't be the one who loves more from today onward." His voice rang coldly in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her heart shuddered, and she widened her eyes as she stared at him. "What do you mean... by that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared at her, and her face was reflected in his dark eyes. "Father was right. The one who loves first and the one who loves more will always be the loser. I don't want to be a loser anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, you're not a loser. I love you just as much. I love you. I really do!" Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he just looked at her calmly, "Grace, I already told you that anyone can betray me but you. I said I wouldn&rsquo;t forgive you if you betrayed me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She instantly turned paler as if her worst fear had come true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t forgive...' These words weighed like a thousand pounds and almost crushed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He raised his hand and stroked her cheek gently like a lover's most gentle comfort, but there was nothing gentle in his eyes when he looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His long fingers slowly landed on her neck. Jason's eyes suddenly darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her slender neck looked so fragile. It was as if he could easily break it if he used some force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Would it stop hurting so much if she no longer exists?' When he watched her drive toward him as he stood at the entry to the freeway earlier, he had the impulse to kill everyone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace did not move or even struggle. All her attention was on the face of the man in front of her. She just stared blankly at those indifferent eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She once thought he would never look at her with such a gaze, but she was the person who took away all the emotions in those eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry... Jay." She sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He trembled slightly. Then, he slowly closed his eyes as his face slowly approached her.</p></div>
