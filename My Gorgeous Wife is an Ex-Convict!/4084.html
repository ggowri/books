        <h1>Chapter 4082</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The woman who had made him feel dizzy with her filming was now passionately kissing another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The naturalness of their actions seemed to tell everyone how good their relationship was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was like a bucket of cold water, making him realize even more clearly that Tina's feelings for him were just like those of a fan for an idol. Even though her eyes seemed to show deep love for him during filming, it was just her immersing herself in the role.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When the photographer called cut, she could quickly switch her gaze and remove the emotions she had put into the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At least in terms of modeling, she seemed to be better suited for the job than he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Why was he feeling so complicated?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was like he had lost something!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> ...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all the filming was over, while Tina was in the dressing room removing her makeup and changing clothes, Weldon walked up to Chandler and said, "I didn't expect you to really come. You've really opened my eyes today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler glanced at him indifferently. "You just wanted to see what my reaction would be, didn't you? Now you've got what you wanted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I was just curious. I heard that Tina was engaged to you from the moment she was born, so I wanted to know what your relationship with your little fianc&eacute;e was like. But after seeing you today, I can tell that you have a good relationship," said Weldon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler narrowed his eyes. "Don't even think about it. If you dare to touch her, your family won't just be expelled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Weldon raised an eyebrow. "What, are you afraid I'll do something to Tina? You can rest assured that I don't want to take revenge on Hunter by doing that. I'm not that crazy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, he was well aware that seeking revenge against Hunter would be like hitting one's head against a brick wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The grudges of the previous generation were their own affairs, and he had no intention of inheriting them. He only wanted to do what he loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But instead of worrying that I might harm Tina, you should worry about whether Tina would treat you the same way if she knew Hunter's secret," Weldon said. "She probably doesn't know Hunter's secret yet, after all, he's very good at keeping secrets. If she knew your true nature, do you think she would see you as a monster?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler's face suddenly darkened. "This is Hunter's business. If you say anything you shouldn't to her, then you should understand the consequences!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gloomy look in Chandler's eyes made Weldon's heart tremble. It was as if if he really said something to Tina, this man in front of him would really kill him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Tina's voice rang out. "What are you guys talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing, just catching up," Weldon was grateful for Tina's sudden interruption, which eased the tension in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Catching up?" Tina was surprised and looked at the two of them. "Do you guys know each other?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I used to work for Hunter too, but for some reason, our group split from Hunter and changed our surname to Patel," Weldon smiled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was surprised to learn of this connection between the two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, Tina, it was a pleasure working with you today. I hope we have the chance to work together again," Weldon said before walking away.</p></div>
