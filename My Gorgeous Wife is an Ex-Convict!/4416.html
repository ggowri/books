        <h1>Chapter 4414: Emergence</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's face changed instantly. His father's words had hit right where he feared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you see, giving me money benefits you too, doesn't it? You can continue your relationship with the young lady from the Hart family, and I can live a decent life. Plus, you can rest assured, I will never show up in front of your Miss Hart. However, if you two get married in the future, you'll have to share a piece of the Hart family's wealth with me. After all, it's only fair considering I've raised you all these years!" At this moment, Lornell's father was speaking confidently, as if the Hart family's fortune was already in his pocket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Calvert could even retort, he heard a familiar voice say, "Well, aren't you quite the mastermind!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's body suddenly stiffened. This voice... it was Harley!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his neck stiffly, looking in the direction the sound came from.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Harley's voice echoed in his ears, Calvert's pupils abruptly contracted, as if the entire world had suddenly dimmed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When did she come?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much of that conversation did she just hear?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would she misunderstand him? Misunderstand that he's with her just for the Hart family's wealth?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of being misunderstood by her made Calvert's body tremble even more intensely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley, I..." He opened his mouth, but couldn't say a word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stepped forward, looking straight into Lornell's father's eyes, "Even if I were with Calvert, you wouldn't get a penny, let alone a share of the pie. If you have any shred of decency left, you'd better leave right now, or I'll call the police and accuse you of having ill intentions! When that time comes, you might end up spending a few years in jail!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--" Lornell's father's face suddenly turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already experienced Harley's tactics before. He was once confined to a hospital by Harley, under the guise of getting him treated and recuperating. But during that time, he couldn't leave the hospital at all, it was practically like being imprisoned!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I am Calvert's father after all. What's wrong with a father asking his son for some money?" Lornell's father argued. After all, he came today to ask for money. Naturally, he wasn't willing to leave without getting any.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of giving you money, to gamble? That's like throwing money into a bottomless pit," Harley said. "You don't need to come to Calvert for money anymore, he won't fund your gambling. When you really reach 60 and can't work, needing alimony, he'll pay exactly what the law requires for support!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Lornell's father snapped angrily, "This is between me and my son, it's none of your business! Even if you are the Miss of the Hart family, you have no right to interfere!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's my boyfriend, of course I have to care about his business!" Harley said, turning to glance at Calvert, "What about you, are you going to give him money?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm listening to you!" Calvert asserted confidently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's father's face grew increasingly grim, glaring at Calvert, "So you're just going to listen to this woman? Now that you have money, you're just going to kick your own father to the curb? If I tell the media, do you think you can still get by? When that time comes, you'll have nothing left!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's father had a look of desperation, like a fish caught in a torn net.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley said nonchalantly, "Is that so? Well, we'll see who ends up with nothing in the end."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's father was taken aback, then it suddenly dawned on him - the person in front of him was a big princess of the entertainment industry!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she wants to protect someone in the entertainment industry, she can definitely do it!</span></p></div>
