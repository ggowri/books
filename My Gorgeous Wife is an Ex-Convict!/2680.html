        <h1>Chapter 2678</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It looked like a hug of reconciliation, but she whispered in Valda Theller's ear...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"See, you have to act in the film when I demand it. At the end of the day, you're just a nobody, Valda Theller. Who do you think you are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Queenie Mack stepped back two or three steps, smiled at Valda Theller, and said, "I'll look forward to your performance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The strike ended with Valda Theller agreeing to be the stand-in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland grabbed her best friend and said worriedly, "Are you really going to be the stand-in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." Valda Theller nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But that scene..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just acting, and it's not real. Besides, the film crew will take protective measures for me," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You apologized and agreed to be the stand-in. Were you... afraid of implicating me?" Camille Strickland began to realize why her best friend was willing to apologize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm scared I'll have to compensate a lot of money to the film crew if this becomes a big deal. It has nothing to do with you!" Valda Theller said with feigned nonchalance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland's eyes reddened slightly. "Valda, I'm sorry. I thought it would be good for you to have a chance to have your comic adapted into a TV show. I never thought..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to apologize to me, and you haven't wronged me." Valda Theller hugged her best friend. "Camille, you've been very helpful to me. I have nothing but gratitude for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you wouldn't have to suffer this if I hadn't fought for this adaptation opportunity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "It's many comic artists&rsquo; dream to have their comic be adapted into a TV show. I'm no exception. Think about it. I've been through so many things that this is nothing. I'll just avoid Queenie Mack after this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland admired her best friend's toughness. "Be careful during the shoot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Valda Theller followed the makeup artist to the dressing room to put on the same costume as Queenie Mack and get the same hairstyle done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was only a double, so there was no need for makeup since the camera would not be filming her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to the scene that they were filming later, the makeup artist made her wear safety pants, lest she accidentally suffered a wardrobe malfunction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and several extras acting as debt-collecting thugs rehearsed before the shoot started to determine the flow. Queenie Mack was not far away watching maliciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Valda Theller is naive to think I&rsquo;ll let her off so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Since Valda Theller dared to humiliate me, she should be prepared to suffer. It's ridiculous that the fool is rehearsing with those extras. She has no idea that I've bribed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Though this is just a shoot, they'll hold nothing back when filming starts!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides that, I ordered the extras to take off Valda Theller's clothes. The person I arranged will then film it and post it online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Valda Theller's reputation will be ruined by then!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack was all the smugger as she thought about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a figure hurried toward Valda Theller.</p></div>
