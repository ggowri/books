        <h1>Chapter 1769</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was only worried about their child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mason's fine. They've pumped his stomach. Lily never said anything about a cure, but the police found out that Lily had bought sleeping pills at the pharmacy in advance. It matches the doctor's speculation," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sleeping pills?" Grace was stunned. "Did Mason take a lot of them? How long will it take for him to wake up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "He didn't take too many. He should wake up tomorrow. I'll ask the doctor to give Mason a more detailed examination by then! Alright, stop worrying. The doctor said he's okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With a sigh of relief, Grace began to notice that she was in an unfamiliar room with several pieces of equipment, some of which had wires attached to her fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is this... the hospital?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "Yeah. Stay here for a couple of days. There&rsquo;s equipment here that can tell us what's exactly going on with your hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He told her about Dr. Russell's diagnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she heard Dr. Russell was only ten percent sure about the operation, Grace laughed bitterly. "I'm familiar with Dr. Russell's medical skills. If it were another doctor, I'm afraid I won't even have that ten percent of certainty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you want to go for the operation? Even if it&rsquo;s successful, we don't know whether there&rsquo;ll be any after-effects. If we proceed with the conservative treatment, at least some of your fingers... can still move."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said the last half of his sentence with much difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had plenty of money, but he could not make her hands normal again. He might even have to watch her hands stop moving completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked down at her hands, which were wrapped in so much gauze that she could not move at all. "I still want to go for the operation. Even if it&rsquo;s only a ten percent chance, I'm still going to try! Otherwise, I'll regret it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was silent for a long time before finally saying thoughtfully, "Okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His answer carried so much emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If the surgery fails, I'll find world-renowned doctors for you," Jason said hoarsely as he took Grace's hands gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she really could not move her hands anymore, then he would be her hands. He would give her everything she wanted with his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, it's okay. I can take it. I've already mentally prepared myself to lose my hands." she consoled him when she saw the worry on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her. "Already? So you knew your hands were in bad shape, but you didn't tell me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She froze. "I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "Grace, I don't want to be oblivious to something that even Brian knows. I don't want you to keep me in the dark even if you're afraid of me worrying or feeling guilty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes seemed to see through what was on her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm sorry." Grace bit her lip slightly and unconsciously tried to lift her hand to touch his cheek. However, her hand had just moved slightly when she realized that both her hands were covered with gauze. Some wires were also attached to them to collect and read data.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't know how Brian knows about my hands. I never told him about it. Maybe he learned about it from Dr. Russell..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She tried to explain, but he leaned over and abruptly kissed her on the lips.</p></div>
