        <h1>Chapter 1222</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, she fell sound asleep in her own bedroom. After tonight, she would sleep in his bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sat by the bed, looking at her as she slept. The mercury-like moonlight fell on him through the window, making him look like a statue&mdash;so beautiful yet a little melancholic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if there were millions upon millions of worries hidden in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, his eyelashes fluttered slightly. He lowered his head and his lips fell on the back of her right hand. It was so sincere and affectionate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, do you know how much I love you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He murmured. No matter how he deceived himself, he had no way to deceive his feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always loved her... so deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought she would have a hard time sleeping on her first night back in Reed Residence, but she slept through the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she opened her eyes, she saw a row of maids standing by the bed. Each of them was holding something different. There were clothes, shoes, socks, jewelry, and various cosmetic products.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered. She had been a little drowsy, but now she was awake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed asked us to assist you in getting dressed today, Young Madam," one of the leading maids said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was almost taken aback by the appellation &lsquo;Young Madam&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young Madam... It seemed to be the first time she was called that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it seemed to be correct.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Put the things down. I'll do it myself," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The maids looked at each other, put down the things in their hands, and retreated from the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace washed up and put on the clothes, she could not help looking at herself in the mirror. She was in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... a white dress with a simple and elegant design. It was perfect for this season.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were a variety of cosmetics products. There were 36 shades of lipstick alone, not to mention the rest. Several trays were all filled with cosmetic products.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought Jason had brought in an entire cosmetics store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She chose a few items and put on light makeup. She briefly brushed her hair and went downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was stunned as soon as she reached the living room. Jason was wearing a white shirt and a pair of white trousers today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if... they were wearing matching outfits! Was it an accident or a coincidence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here, have breakfast first. We'll go to tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau later," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave him a reply and walked to the table. Jason asked the maid to serve Grace's breakfast. It was a Chinese-style breakfast. Soy milk, wontons, and steamed bun&mdash;all of which she liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could help but glance at Jason as she ate her breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dressed in a white shirt and a pair of white trousers, he looked like Prince Charming from those fairytales. His defined face and delicate features made it almost impossible to detect a flaw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I... really going to marry him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was so much going on these days that she found it all unreal.</p></div>
