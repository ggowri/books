        <h1>Chapter 770</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A stream of questions came out of his mouth with an eagerness he never had before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked in surprise at Jason who was on top of her. It was as if all the quiet repression on their trip back had exploded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, let me go first. I can explain," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, instead of letting go of her hand, he lowered his head and showered kisses on her face. "Sure. Explain. I'll listen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to let her go no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt as if her body temperature was rising, and her thoughts seemed to be affected by his kisses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I just went to Grandma's grave to pay my respects today. Then when I was walking down the hill, I took a path and went to the nearby hill. I used to play there when I was a child, so I thought I would have a look. I didn&rsquo;t think I would bump into Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace told the story as quickly as she could. She did not want him to get the wrong idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she hid the fact that she had restored her memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Since I want to keep it as a secret, then I'll bury it in the bottom of my heart forever!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you fell off a cliff?" Jason's pupils constricted immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Fortunately... Brian was there and he gave me a hand. However, I passed out and woke up to see him carrying me down the hill." She went on explaining, "I was going to walk down by myself, but I had some bruises on me. If I walked on my own, I wouldn't be able to reach the foot of the hill before dark, so&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he immediately lifted her dress, and at once, the bruises on her legs caught his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially her ankles. He did not notice them earlier because of her long skirt and shoes, but her ankles were now red, swollen, and grazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you say anything earlier?" Looking at her scars, he felt as if his heart was twisting with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With his character, he would not have felt anything if someone in front of him was bleeding all over and had no skin left intact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, looking at her injuries, he found it so hard to bear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I forgot," muttered Grace. He had been carrying her down the hill and was acting differently as well. She was so focused on him that she forgot all about her bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his thin lips. The next moment, he suddenly picked her up and walked into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The warm water gently washed her wretched body. He squatted down and gently washed her wounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt?" he finally asked, staring at the bruises on her ankle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This injury is nothing to me," she said, not wanting him to mind the bruises too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her words seemed to make his eyes cloud with a layer of gloom. Of course, he knew that the bruises were much smaller than the ones she had suffered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The large and small scars on her body seemed to recount silently what she had suffered in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more he loved her, the more he could not bear to see her hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even now, he dared not imagine what it was like when she was tortured and injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his head, bent forward, and pressed his lips on the bruises on her ankle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lower lip slightly. "Jason, it doesn't hurt."</p></div>
