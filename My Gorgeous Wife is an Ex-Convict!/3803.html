        <h1>Chapter 3801</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the silent apartment, only Veronica remained. After a long time, the room was filled with the sound of sobbing, which grew louder and louder until it turned into wailing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica cried almost all night. Throughout the night, she tightly held the cat pendant that originally belonged to Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was something he had discarded, she couldn't bear to throw it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pair of pendants seemed to commemorate the time they spent together. If she threw them away, it would seem like there was nothing left to remember.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, she only appeared at school during class, and many students looked at her with various expressions because she was Mason's girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those people didn't know that she and Mason had already broken up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her friend Shirley Woolery looked incredulous when she found out about the breakup. "Veronica, you...you broke up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But...that was so fast. You guys weren't together for very long, were you?" Shirley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it was too fast. You can love someone and then quickly stop loving them," Veronica murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Mason, who had a relationship with her for over a decade, wouldn't just stop loving her like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the current Mason is different, he's not the same Mason who had those years of emotional connection with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His feelings for her are probably just based on the few months since they met again after he returned to the country, so it's easy for him to fall out of love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, how deep can feelings be in just a few months?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as for her... her feelings for him have been going on for over a decade... Veronica smiled bitterly. From the beginning, their relationship and feelings for each other were unequal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what about you now..." Shirley didn't know how to comfort her friend, especially since her friend's relationship with Mason had caused a stir in school and everyone knew about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, her friend had broken up with Mason again. If the other students found out, who knows what rumors would spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Veronica tried to cheer up in front of her friend, forcing a smile. "It's just a breakup, everyone goes through a few breakups in life, do we have to be devastated every time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you need someone to accompany you, just let me know. I'm always free to hang out with you, go shopping and eat good food together!" Shirley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Veronica agreed, looking at the time. "I have to go now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going?" Shirley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To visit someone in the hospital," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, a new employee in the company, wouldn't have attracted attention from the higher-ups even if he was hospitalized due to an injury. But somehow, the leaders found out about Daniel's injury and his intention to sue Mason, and they also knew that she was Daniel's ex-girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the company leaders asked her to go and persuade Daniel to drop the lawsuit, and if he was willing to focus on recovering and drop the lawsuit, the company would keep his position and let him continue working after he recovered.</span></p></div>
