        <h1>Chapter 1845</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you doing here?" he asked as he got up and stepped forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I dropped off the kids at their interest class nearby after leaving the hospital and dropped by to see you. By the way, Mrs. Watts's operation went well. The doctor said she can leave the hospital in a week," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Jason asked indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "If you have time, come with me to the hospital to see Mrs. Watts. Speaking of which, it seems that you haven't seen them after their first day here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want me to spend more time with them?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They're like family to me. They took good care of Jasper and me when we were in L City. Of course, I hope you can get along with them. You guys can get closer if you spend more time with each other, "said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What will you do if I say I can never get along with them?" Jason asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was stunned. "What's wrong? Do you not like my mentor and his wife?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, I just want to ask whose side you&rsquo;ll take if I can never get along with them?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace smiled. "If you really can't get along, then we can live our own lives separately. They'll go back to L City, and I can just go to L City whenever I want to visit them. Jay, I won't ask you to please the people I like for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, her mentor and his wife were kind to her, not Jay. Jay could like them for her, but if he could not, then there was no need to force it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked down slightly. His eyes grew darker and darker as he looked at the faint smile on the corners of her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If everything was as he speculated, then her mentor and his wife might not be able to return to L City. She would have to choose sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Promise me that you won't stand against me no matter what happens," Jason said as he stared at Grace with a burning gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There's no way I'll stand against you," Grace said with amusement and stroked his cheek with her still awkward fingers. "Jay, I&rsquo;ll stand by you no matter what!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes lit up, then a smile slowly appeared on the corners of his lips. It was beautiful and charming. "Then you must remember what you told me today, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I'll remember it. I won't forget it!" She coaxed gently as if soothing a troubled child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He raised his hand to gently bring the hand she put on his cheek to his lips and kissed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps it was for the best if it was not as he speculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, I... can leave the hospital in a couple of days. Your mentor and I have also booked our flight home. But before we go back, I want to go to your father-in-law's tomb to pay my respects. After all, though it's a little presumptuous of us to say this, we think of you as our daughter. Hence, we think of him as our in-law," said Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was a little surprised. After all, her mentor and his wife had already offered incense to her father-in-law in the mourning hall. This time, they even wanted to go to his tomb to pay their respects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"His tomb is in the Reed family's ancestral cemetery. Outsiders aren&rsquo;t allowed to enter," Grace said a little awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Mrs. Watts's face was visibly upset.</p></div>
