        <h1>Chapter 604</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, and now there was an air of danger about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The desire in his eyes seemed like it wanted to devour her completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips continued to kiss her skin, and his fingers moved from place to place all over her body. She felt like she had lost her strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay... Jay... Don't... Don't do this..." stammered Grace as she tried to stop him from doing anything further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, right now, she could not move his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had already torn her floral dress to shreds. Then, he straightened up, looked down at her, and took off his jacket...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was trembling. If it went on like this, they would probably...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, she did not want it this way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially now when he seemed different from his usual self. He wanted her just to prove something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As his body covered hers once again, she began to struggle. "I don't want to prove it this way, Jay. This... This proves nothing at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This proves nothing?" he asked in a mutter. "You want me, don't you? You desire me too. You love me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I love you, so I'll love you even without doing this. But if I don't love you, I still won't love you even if you did this. If there's no love, it's nothing more than physical touch," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her words seemed to make his eyes grow darker, more sensual, and more complex than she could understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his head and more kisses fell on her. "Then let's see if it's just physical touch..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Oh, God. Her words seemed to have had the opposite effect! Grace frowned, subconsciously trying to push him off her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he clasped the wrists of her hands together. His tie was wrapped tightly around her wrist, preventing her hands from moving freely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" she shouted nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was as if he had not heard her voice at all. His beautiful and once bright eyes seemed to be completely covered with darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you're mine and you can only be mine. I won't give you up to anyone!" he muttered as his body once again covered hers...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to be his. He wanted to be extremely sure of it. He wanted to own her completely, to eliminate the slightest bit of uncertainty that could go wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out it was so scary to love someone, so much so that he wanted to take over everything about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was his father this in love with his mother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After his mother left, even staying alive seemed to have become a luxury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that he would never fall in love with anyone in his life. Even if he married and had children, it would only be because he needed to leave an heir to the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she seemed to imprint more and more on his mind and heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so much so that he would not even allow anyone the slightest possibility of touching her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman would say tenderly, "Follow me home. From now on, you matter to me and I matter to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman would put her arms around him when he was distressed, making him feel that he was not alone in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only when he had her by his side would he feel like he enjoyed life and had something he really wanted!</p></div>
