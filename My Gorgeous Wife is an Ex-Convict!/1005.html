        <h1>Chapter 1004</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why would he investigate Kyla Corbyn's time in jail after so many years? Is it possible that Martin has rekindled his feelings for Kyla Corbyn after finding her again?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Paisley Daniels was speculating, the office door was suddenly pushed open and Martin Weiss came in. When he saw the document Paisley Daniels was holding, his eyes darkened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels said hesitantly, "I... I made some pastries for you. Martin, why do you want to investigate Kyla Corbyn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stepped forward and took the document from Paisley Daniels. "Since we want to fight for the child&rsquo;s custody, we should investigate what happened to her these past few years so that we can have the upper hand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Really?' However, Paisley Daniels was still uneasy. "Martin, I'm so afraid. I'm afraid that you still have feelings for Kyla Corbyn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about? I can't possibly have feelings for her," Martin Weiss said coldly. He turned around to return to his desk, but Paisley Daniels suddenly embraced him from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry I spoke out of turn. Some people have been laughing at me, saying that you won't marry me and that it&rsquo;s all my wishful thinking. Martin... I just love you so much that I&rsquo;m too sensitive now," Paisley Daniels said aggrievedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression softened when he heard this. "I know you had to bear those rumors when I left the party suddenly. I'll make it up to you. I'll have someone handle the news online."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned around slowly and looked at her with his head lowered. "You don't have to be afraid of anything. We'll get married!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was when Paisley Daniels smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Paisley Daniels left, Martin Weiss sat back in the chair as if he was a little tired. He raised his hand and opened the document about Kyla Corbyn. He had felt depressed and uncomfortable when he got the document today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had long known that the woman's life in prison was not easy, but when he read the documents about her suffering in prison, he somehow felt breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A pregnant woman like her was treated so inhumanely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a stroke of luck that she was able to give birth to Nelson safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop being influenced by that woman. She doesn't deserve it!" muttered Martin Weiss as he tiredly closed his eyes, trying to banish the figure from his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Paisley Daniels returned to the Daniels family's house, Mrs. Daniels hurried forward and asked, "How did it go? What did Martin say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels smiled and said, "Martin said he&rsquo;ll marry me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't let anything go wrong!" said Mrs. Daniels as she gritted her teeth. &ldquo;I didn't expect Kyla Corbyn to show up in front of Martin. How could she be so lucky to have given birth to a child? Why didn't she just die in prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had deliberately paid people to let Kyla Corbyn suffer more in prison, but it turned out to be a waste of effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels said, "It's no use talking about it now. Anyway, when the kid comes, I have ways to raise him wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You mustn't let Martin find out that you framed Kyla Corbyn and..." Mrs. Daniels's voice paused. "Don't let him know that Kyla Corbyn is the person who gave him the bone marrow transplant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The bone marrow transplant was a double-blind surgery. Martin and Kyla Corbyn both don&rsquo;t know who the other party was. Besides, I also took the opportunity to destroy the hospital's data. Martin won't know!" said Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, the bone marrow transplant center had also called her because she met the conditions. It was just that she refused while Kyla Corbyn accepted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, when she accidentally found out that the one receiving the bone marrow transplant was actually the heir of the rich and powerful Weiss family, she immediately regretted it. However, the operation for the bone marrow transplant had already been completed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she could only find the opportunity to appear in front of Martin Weiss afterward and let slip about the bone marrow transplant, making Martin mistakenly think that she saved him.</p></div>
