        <h1>Chapter 2777</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The guests of the birthday party were mesmerized but also confused, wondering why the celebrity Neil came to wish Camille Strickland a happy birthday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had some speculation after coming to her senses. She turned to Brian and asked in a mutter, "Did you ask Neil to come?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since your friend is Neil's fan, don't you want her to have a great birthday? She&rsquo;ll be happier if Neil comes," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He did it!' Valda Theller said gratefully, "Thank you. Camille must be... elated today." Just looking at Camille's expression, Valda Theller could figure out her best friend's joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neil took a photo with Camille Strickland and gave her his autograph after he finished singing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Camille Strickland invited him to sit down to have a cake, Neil readily agreed and finished a slice of cake before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland felt like she was in a dream after Neil left. When Camille Strickland dragged Valda Theller to the washroom, she could not help saying, "Valda, did Brian arrange for Neil to wish me a happy birthday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a lot of thinking, it seemed only Brian could get Neil to come here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Yeah. I told him you wanted Neil's autograph. I only asked for an autograph. Who knew he invited Neil right away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's indeed the crown prince. He can just invite anyone he wants.&rdquo; Camille Strickland was amazed. "Today is probably the most memorable birthday I've ever had. Not many fans can have their idols present to celebrate their birthday!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said and gave Valda Theller a big hug. "Valda, thank you so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian invited Neil, not me. What are you thanking me?" Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll thank Brian, of course. But if you weren&rsquo;t his girlfriend, why would he invite Neil to celebrate my birthday for me?&rdquo; Camille Strickland was quite clear about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While chatting, they walked out of the washroom and headed toward the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when they were about to reach the private room, the door of the private room next door suddenly opened. The person who came out was their classmate in university.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person was also stunned to see Camille Strickland and Valda Theller. Then, they sized them up contemptuously. "Camille Strickland, didn't you say you wouldn't attend the class reunion? What are you doing here? You should know that people like Valda Theller aren't welcome."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland looked awkward. She knew about the class reunion. However, someone mentioned not wanting Valda Theller to attend the class reunion, so she did not attend. She also did not mention it to Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It just so happened that their classmates chose the same restaurant for the class reunion as Camille Strickland&rsquo;s birthday party. They&hellip; were even next door to each other. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're not here for the class reunion. You think too much," said Camille Strickland, dragging Valda Theller away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they did not expect their university classmate to stop them. "Where are you going? Since you're here, you might as well meet everyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, they opened the private room door as wide as they could and shouted inside, "Hey, guys. Look who's here. Someone came to the class reunion without being invited."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in the private room instantly saw Valda Theller and Camille Strickland. Barbara Schuman was among them.</p></div>
