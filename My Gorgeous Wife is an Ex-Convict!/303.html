        <h1>Chapter 302</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly fastened her seat belt and watched with some wonder as Jason pulled the car away from Reed Residence. He drove in the direction where Hadwin was said to be at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he taking her there?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his face was livid right now. His thin lips were tightly pressed together, and his eyes seemed dark and hazy, signifying his displeasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened her mouth and wanted to say something, but she was afraid that if she said anything now, she would annoy him even more. That would be bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, nothing was said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the most important thing was to see Lina and find out what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Then I shall wait for Jason's anger to subside before... thanking him,' Grace thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When their car got to Crescent Bay, security stopped them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell Hadwin that Jason wants to see him. Ask him whether he's going to meet us," Jason said, straight to the point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few security guards heard this and their eyes flashed with surprise. After all, everyone in Emerald City knew of the name &lsquo;Jason&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, even if the security guards did not recognize Jason, the Bentley he was driving was recognizable to those who knew about cars. It was a car that cost nearly ten million dollars. It was beyond the reach of the average person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, one of the guards started contacting their captain...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, in the mansion at Crescent Bay, Lina was staring anxiously at the man in front of her. She had no idea that he would drag her into the car in broad daylight and confiscate her phone before turning it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It went without saying that Lina could imagine how anxious her best friend would be right now, but she could not even call Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, she had no access to her phone at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Plus, her parents might be trying to get a hold of her too. If they called her and found her phone to be switched off, her parents would probably be worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was now as anxious as a cat on hot bricks while the man seemed to enjoy watching her in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's heart suddenly ached when she saw his expression. That was not how he looked at her back in the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he clung on to her just like a little cute puppy. He would always give a shy and uneasy smile, scratch his head in embarrassment, and pull at her clothes, acting as cute as an innocent child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now... She had not seen him for more than three years. He was almost unrecognizable to her now. Though it was the same face and though his features still looked like it was made by God, his aura had completely changed. It was like a cute puppy dog... that had turned into a little bad wolf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Uh, no. A big bad wolf!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can I have my phone back? I need to call my friend and my parents." Lina once again repeated what she had said many times before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He, however, gave a half-smile and asked, "Are you in a hurry?"</p></div>
