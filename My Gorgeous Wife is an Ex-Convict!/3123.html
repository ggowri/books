        <h1>Chapter 3121</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber immediately pulled the curtains shut, cutting off the brief eye contact between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if George stood outside all night, her emotions wouldn't be affected at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Downstairs from the apartment, George's eyes showed clear disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber still kept him at a distance, but it was good that he could at least steal a glance at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now...the only thing that connects them is their child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, over the past year, he has brought the child to see her several times, but each time, her attitude towards him has been cold and distant, as if no matter how he approached her, he couldn't get any closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This night attack is punishment from the heavens for his past mistakes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Amber, how much longer do I have to wait for your forgiveness?" he murmured painfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But no one can tell him the answer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">***</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian works during the day, while Valda stays alone in the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Initially, Brian was worried and wanted to hire a nanny for Valda, but she refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can live on my own, and besides, this place is so small. If a stranger comes over, I'll feel uncomfortable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Brian had to give up and just reminded Valda to call him if anything happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda spent the day alone at home and started cleaning the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when she opened the closet and saw a few men's clothes hanging in it, she couldn't help but be stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is Brian planning to stay here long-term?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a wealthy young man used to a life of luxury, living together with her in this small apartment is really quite unexpected...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about this morning when she saw him awkwardly roll off the couch, she couldn't help but bite her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her sofa is already a small-sized one, designed for small apartments, and is smaller than a regular sofa. It's easy to imagine how uncomfortable it must be for him, being a tall person, to sleep on such a sofa every night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he never said it out loud, he only asked her if she slept well and prepared breakfast for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Valda's phone rang and she saw that it was a call from the real estate agent. However, the news the agent gave her was not good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Theller, the house you were interested in last time has already been sold. I'm sorry about that. If you have some free time, I can show you a few other houses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sold?" Valda felt a bit disappointed, as she actually quite liked the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'm free today. How about we look at a few more properties today?" said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." The agent replied, and after agreeing on a time and place to meet, Valda left the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The agent took her to see a house today, which is also a 10-year-old community. However, the environment inside the community is still good. The house is a ground floor with two bedrooms and two living rooms, and the price is also reasonable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda thinks it's okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How about it, Miss Theller, are you satisfied with this place? The location of this community is good, it's also close to the subway station, and there are all kinds of markets and supermarkets nearby..." the agent introduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, "I'll think about it and see if you can negotiate with the landlord to lower the price."</p></div>
