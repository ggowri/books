        <h1>Chapter 4078</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're nervous, you can think of something else in your mind, and you won't be so nervous," Tina kindly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit sneered inwardly. She was indeed an ignorant rich girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At a time like this, a newcomer like her was telling someone with much more experience in this field what to do. This kind of ignorant kindness often caused others to be displeased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But a rich girl like her probably wouldn't care anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, even if she said or did something, no one dared to do anything to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What were you thinking about when you were shooting just now?" Kit asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was thinking about Medusa," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Medusa?" Kit was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Medusa. She is a snake-haired monster in Greek mythology. It is said that anyone who looks into her eyes will turn into stone. In anime, there are many stories that extend from the myth of Medusa. I think Medusa is quite pitiful. This ability may not be what she wants. Maybe she just wants someone to truly see her and take her into their eyes, but once someone does that, the price is losing their life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina paused. "Medusa is actually very lonely. Because of her loneliness, she becomes sharper and uses her beautiful appearance to attract people's attention. But the more she does this, the more lonely she becomes. It's a vicious cycle. What she hopes for is just someone to accompany her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice was calm and slow, but it made Kit's heart tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you just put yourself into Medusa?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it feels more real that way," Tina said. "Every time I shoot, I like to put myself into a specific character. That way, I feel like I am experiencing that character's life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Experiencing life... Kit couldn't help but sink into thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Medusa is interesting," a voice suddenly interrupted. Weldon had appeared beside them without them noticing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was looking at Tina with interest, obviously having heard their previous conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It gives me some inspiration. I hope you can surprise me in the next shoot," Weldon said. "Okay, let's continue in a bit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the two finished their makeup, Weldon asked Kit to lean against the wall and told Tina, "Okay, Tina, get closer. You can play with Kit's hair, or his cheeks, or his neck, giving people a teasing feeling that can't be put into words, but don't make it feel cheap..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Weldon gave his instructions, he began to shoot. Looking at Tina through the lens, he couldn't help but feel amazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is Chandler's fianc&eacute;e, the heiress of the Stephenson family. Originally, she was chosen to see what kind of person she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her today was a bit unexpected for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has an excellent sense of the camera, even better than he imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She interprets the emotions needed in the shot in her own way. Like now, she lightly plays with Kit's bangs with her fingers. The subtle tension and the changes in the corners of her eyes and eyebrows make him increasingly excited, wanting to capture more of her expressions.</p></div>
