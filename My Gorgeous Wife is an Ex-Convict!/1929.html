        <h1>Chapter 1927</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze and realized that the woman he was talking about was &lsquo;Mrs. Watts&rsquo; from before she was disfigured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had seen a photo of his mother when she was young, and Mason did look like her. He might look even more like her in a few years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, Mason is our child no matter how much you hate Mrs. Watts. Don't..." Grace paused as if she was choosing her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason went ahead and said, "Don't worry, I'm not going to take my anger out on our children. Mason is the child you fought so hard to give birth to. All three children are precious to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was relieved to hear that. She hesitated for a moment and said, "My mentor and his wife saw the news and called to ask about it. Mrs. Watts even wants to come back to Emerald City to see you, not caring about what would happen to her. Jay, I think not a day goes by that Mrs. Watts doesn't regret it. Perhaps she wants to make up for her mistakes with her life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even if she dies, she can't make up for it." Jason's voice suddenly turned cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knew that some things in this world could not be remedied. No matter how miserable Mrs. Watts was, she could not undo that mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew he did not like to talk about Mrs. Watts, but he still needed closure for what had happened between him and his mother. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, what are you going to do to Mrs. Watts?" Grace asked nervously as her hands gripped the hem of her hospital gown. If he wanted to kill Mrs. Watts, then she...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Make sure she never sets foot in Emerald City again for the rest of her life," Jason said slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at him with a look of shock on her face. 'Does that mean... He's...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you... Are you going to let Mrs. Watts off?" she asked in shock, her voice trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes were full of struggle and conflict before they reduced to calmness. "Yes, I'm letting her off. It's just that I never want to see this woman again. I'll just think that she died that year back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's eyes suddenly became misty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "What's the matter? Do you think I'm too heartless? You don't want me to&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace shook her head and interrupted, "No, I know... I know this is a big concession. I know it well. Jay, thank you. Thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew how deeply his mother had hurt him and how hard it must have been for him to let Mrs. Watts off the hook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason raised his hand and caressed Grace's wet eyes. He did all this for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he wanted to kill her, she might not intervene again, but it would haunt her for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "I can only say that the woman's lucky. She was kind to you and Jasper, so her kindness saved her life. But you should never mention your mentor and that woman in front of me again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace nodded solemnly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, then it's settled. Smile, Grace. I want to see you smile." He wanted to see her smile, not her sad face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace wiped away the tears and smiled. She took the initiative to kiss Jason on the lips. "Jay, you're... the man who loves me the most!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He accepted her kiss and put his hands tenderly around her waist. Perhaps he would have had his way with her if they were not wounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When it was over, Jason said hoarsely, "Grace, you're also the woman who loves me the most."</p></div>
