        <h1>Chapter 4267 I Will Survive</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler chuckled bitterly, but still firmly said, "Dad, I will survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colin didn't know how to persuade his son at that moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the old Mr. Hunter sighed, "Such a tragic fate! Well, you can do as you wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad!" Adele shouted, "Are you just going to watch Chandler die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else can I do? Can I force him to have a child with Tina?" the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's leave it at that for now," said the old Mr. Hunter. "Now that Chandler and Tina are like this, we can only think of other ways to remove the curse from Chandler's body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele and Colin glanced at each other. Adele wanted to say something, but Colin stopped her with his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving their son's ward, the old Mr. Hunter went back to the Hunter family first. Adele turned to her husband and said, "Do you really agree with Dad's plan? It's so dangerous to try to remove the curse. If it were that easy to succeed, the Hunter family wouldn't have lost so many people before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else can we do? You know Chandler's personality. Once he makes up his mind, do you think you can change it?" Colin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele remained silent and didn't say anything for a while. Finally, she said, "Anyway, with such a big matter as their divorce, I still need to talk to the Stephenson family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colin nodded. "That's fine!" This matter indeed required a meeting with the Stephenson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Hadwin and Lina received a call from the Hunter family, saying that they needed to have a serious talk about the divorce of the two children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only at this moment that Hadwin and Lina learned that their daughter had already officially divorced Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After agreeing on a meeting time with the Hunter family, they came to their daughter's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and Chandler are divorced?" Hadwin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback. "He told you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Chandler's parents who called, saying that the adults from both families should meet and discuss this matter," Hadwin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." Tina's eyelashes trembled slightly, and she responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divorce? Although she had the divorce agreement signed by Chandler in her hand when she was about to hand it over to the lawyer to proceed with the divorce procedures, an indescribable feeling suddenly spread in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uneasiness, fear, and reluctance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she couldn't bear to go through with the divorce. Was it because of the lingering emotions in her body? How much did the old her really love him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the old her had known that Chandler's kindness towards her was only because their child could remove the curse from him, would she still love Chandler?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would she still choose to marry him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know the answer, but in the end, she kept the divorce agreement in her hand and didn't hand it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So strictly speaking, she and Chandler are not officially divorced yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since the Hunter family now thinks they are already divorced, it's fine. Anyway, in a few days, she will proceed with the divorce procedures, and they will be officially divorced then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did his parents say how Chandler is doing now?" Tina couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler is in the hospital," Hadwin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, they should have visited Chandler in the hospital, but after learning that their daughter had divorced him, they decided not to go to the hospital temporarily to avoid </span><span>awkwardness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned. He's in the hospital?!</span></p></div>
