        <h1>Chapter 485</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do... Do you know what you're doing?" A simple sentence like that escaped his mouth word by word after much difficulty&mdash;it was like squeezing toothpaste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip. "I... I know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was now pressed against his back, and the blanket that covered her fell to the ground. At this moment, she just wanted to follow her heart and tell him what she wanted to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she had summoned up all her courage for this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think I love you, Jay!" exclaimed Grace. Yes, she wanted to tell him what she really felt instead of staying silent when he asked her whether she loved him. She did not want to watch as his eyes were slowly replaced by gloom any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he know that her heart had pricked a little whenever he tried so hard to resist his impulse and yet still soothed her, saying that he would never do anything she did not want to?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in his eyes, she was not in love with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know how much I love you, and I don't know to what extent, but I love you," Grace continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to hide her feelings because she did not want him to misunderstand. She did not want to see the gloom in his eyes. It was as if all the stars were fading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason turned around stiffly, staring at the person in front of him. He said hoarsely, "Is it true? Do you really love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had heard the answer he wanted most, but he still could not believe it. Therefore, other than the desperate restraint in his eyes as he looked at her, there were also tension and caution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. I love you, so you don't have to restrain yourself, Jason," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands slowly went around his neck. Then, she stood on her tiptoes and pressed her lips to his, telling him that she was willing with her actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was probably what love was. Because she loved him, she did not want him to suppress anything, so she was willing to give what she could give.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were in love with each other, so this was normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was over, he bent over, panting while his face was buried in her neck. He muttered, "Are you sure? No regrets?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," she answered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he picked her up and went back to the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace..." he muttered her name. "I love you..." While undressing each other, he kissed her and tried hard to please her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only person in the world who could make him like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just because... he loved her so much, and... wanted her to love him more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was finally his... and he was hers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not remember how many times he had his way with her that night. The madness was beyond her imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not feel the slightest reluctance, as if wallowing in it was a matter of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time he finally carried her to the bathroom to wash up, she had hardly any strength left and fell asleep as she cleaned herself up.</p></div>
