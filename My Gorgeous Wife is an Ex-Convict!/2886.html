        <h1>Chapter 2884</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you care about me?" She smiled bitterly. "That word isn&rsquo;t only something you say but..." She did not continue speaking after a pause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he already knew what she was going to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned pale. He knew that the incident at the comic fiesta was something that bothered her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the one who caused it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, I think we'd better talk about the possibility of me getting pregnant!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, go ahead," he said as he asked the others in the living room to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you insist that I have the baby if I get pregnant?" she asked, looking at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you&rsquo;re pregnant, I don't want to lose the baby," he said. He had never longed for children even though his parents had always wanted grandchildren, even if it was out of wedlock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, such ideas had never occurred to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he wanted to have the baby because they would be... his baby with Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if I don't want the baby, are you still going to stop me from having an abortion?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent as if in acquiescence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you do something illegal? For example, lock me up in the mansion or something like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He continued staying silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips together and added, "If I give birth to the baby, can I keep the baby with me? I can support the baby with my income. Of course, you and your family can meet the child, but custody is mine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We can get married and be a happy family for our children," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I don't want to get married?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll marry me. You will!" Brian said. He was speaking to her but also to himself as if he was giving himself some courage and faith.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sighed and felt the urge to cry as she said, "Brian, do I even have a choice?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He froze. Tears filled Valda Theller's eyes at some point, making his heart ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Assuming we're going to have a child together, you'll be making the decisions for me every step of the way. I won&rsquo;t even get a chance to make a decision for myself. If that's how you care about me, I&rsquo;d rather not have you care about me." Such care made her feel like a puppet being manipulated by his strings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want to be with you," Brian said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want to be with me? Or is it because my presence has made Grace think you&rsquo;ve gotten over her and started a new relationship? In this case, you&rsquo;ve given her the peace of mind she wants." Valda Theller laughed at herself. "Come to think of it, it was a </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">coincidence that you chose me as your girlfriend in the first place. In other words, it could have been someone else even if it wasn't me. I'm not that irreplaceable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian blurted out, "No, it's not like that! Not everyone else can do it. When I was looking at you and you were smiling at me while drawing me, I had the impulse to ask you if you wanted to date me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked blankly at Brian. She heard Brian continue, "Later, I wondered why I was so impulsive at the time. If it was just to reassure Grace, I could have chosen someone familiar to do this instead of a stranger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, why is that?' The question had haunted Valda Theller now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think it's because I'm comfortable being with you. Even if we're only eating a bowl of noodles or a meal in silence, I feel comfortable." He had not felt that comfort for a long time.</p></div>
