        <h1>Chapter 4315 Covered in injuries</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the registration desk in the hospital, Harley asked the boy, "What's your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert Elledge," the boy replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley wrote his name in the newly purchased medical record book, assigned him a number, and then accompanied him to wait in line outside the examination room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked at Harley, who had been by his side all along and felt a different kind of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rarely came to the hospital because it was a luxury for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even on the few occasions he did come to the hospital, he came alone without anyone accompanying him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to envy those patients who had someone with them at the hospital, but gradually, he stopped feeling envious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he knew that envy was pointless. It would only make him complain more about the unfairness of fate, without bringing any change to his own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she is by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this what it feels like to have someone by your side?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long before it was Calvert's turn. At that moment, he even felt like time was too short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor examined Calvert's injuries and informed him that there was nothing serious, just a need for some ointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the doctor examined him, Calvert felt a bit embarrassed when he had to take off his shirt. Harley said, "Don't be shy, it's more important for the doctor to see the injuries!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert took off his shirt, revealing a multitude of old scars that made Harley gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the visible bruises from today's beating, she never expected him to have so many old scars. It was as if he had been beaten since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor took a look and sighed, "You need to take care of your body from now on. It may not show now while you're young, but you'll know the pain when you get older!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley paid for Calvert's medical expenses and handed him the medicine after picking it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert took the medicine and asked, "Do you find it disgusting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" She was taken aback and didn't understand what he was asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You saw the injuries on my body just now, did you find them disgusting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disgusting? Harley didn't feel that way. She was more surprised, and after the surprise, she </span><span>felt a kind of sympathy towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, "No after you take these medicines back, make sure to apply them properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will repay you for the cost of the medicines, although it may take some time," he said awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to repay me, I promised to help you with medical expenses. By the way, are you going back to school now or somewhere else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go home first," he whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Harley said, hailing a taxi for Calvert outside the hospital. She then handed him $100 before he got in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I'll take the bus back myself," he hurriedly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can barely walk steadily right now, so why don't you take a taxi back? $100 should cover the fare. Take good rest!" After saying this, she stuffed him into a taxi, closed the door, and turned around to catch another taxi and leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stared blankly at the departing taxi, feeling a mix of emotions.</span></p></div>
