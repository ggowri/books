        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his voice was so calm! It was as if he was just calmly telling her about his decision!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared blankly into his eyes for a moment. She only felt as if she were caught in an invisible net and was unable to move. She could not even look away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop looking! Don't look at him anymore!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She desperately told herself. Sometime later, she suddenly turned her head away and opened the car door. She got on it as though she was fleeing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car pulled away slowly after the door closed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss watched the car fade out of sight and smiled bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe this was the best ending for him and Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking out his phone, he ordered the person on the other end of the line, "Look into the people who dined with Kyla in the private room today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since those people tried to use her, they would have to suffer the consequences!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman came to the store early in the morning and repeatedly apologized to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I'm sorry. I had no idea things would end up like that yesterday. Oh, Mr. Lambert had a little too much to drink and is used to being cocky. That's why he spoke so harshly. Don't mind him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her and said bluntly, "You planned everything at the hot pot restaurant yesterday, didn't you? You brought me there, took me to the private room, and asked me to call Martin Weiss to come over. None of it was coincidental, was it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman immediately looked guilty as she chuckled drily. "I... I had no other choice. I'm only Neal Reid's lover. He has always wanted to make connections with the Weiss family. After learning that I know you and you know Martin Weiss, he asked me to set up a meeting. He thought he could seal some business deals if he could speak to Martin Weiss over a meal. Who knew it would end up like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't do anything like that again. If you want to have a meal with me, we can. But if you want other people to join us, then I&rsquo;ll have to refuse," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman smiled faintly and asked curiously, "But Martin Weiss seemed really nice to you yesterday. He even made a move on Mr. Lambert for you. Mr. Lambert couldn&rsquo;t resist at all. The head of the Weiss family is indeed extraordinary. Why don't you put in a good word for my Neal? His company happens to be bidding for Weiss Group's project."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not familiar with business. Besides, I never talk to Martin Weiss about business. I&rsquo;m not involved in his business!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's expression changed slightly. Then, she smiled even brighter. "Just because you&rsquo;re not involved now doesn&rsquo;t mean you won&rsquo;t be in the future. You have much to gain if Neal wins the bid. Give us a number. I promise Neal will pay you that amount."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her indifferently. "I don't think I can help you. I welcome you if you sincerely want to catch up with me. But if you want to talk about business and Martin Weiss, no thanks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Jacqueline Bowman frowned. "Kyla, I helped you out when we were in prison. When everyone was mean to you, I was kind to you, wasn't I? You have a good life waiting for you now that you&rsquo;ve hooked up with Martin Weiss and are carrying his baby. Won't you even help me out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together. "Martin Weiss has nothing to do with my life now. I appreciate what you did for me in prison, and I'll do my best to help you if you ever get in trouble. But Martin Weiss has nothing to do with me, so I can't help you out with these matters."</p></div>
