        <h1>Chapter 2907</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It must be like this, so... that's why you broke up!" Camille Strickland felt deeply sorry for her friend at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Until now, she finally understood that the pain her friend had endured that day was far greater than she had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I didn't even know!" Camille Strickland hugged her friend with heartache. She was angry at herself for not realizing it earlier, especially since she was at the scene of the exhibition that day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille, I'm fine, you don't have to worry about me." Valda Theller said, "And the reason why Brian Hart and I broke up was simply because I felt that I couldn't make him fall in love with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You always do this, always easily blaming yourself." Camille Strickland felt even more heartbroken, "If I were you, I would have probably just beaten Brian Hart up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, my relationship with Brian Hart is over, and we won't have anything to do with each other in the future." Valda Theller said. She wasn't pregnant, and maybe it was God's will that they wouldn't have any more ties between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, we won't have anything to do with him in the future!" Camille Strickland said, "Come on, let's go buy some clothes. Tomorrow, I will make sure to dress you up beautifully, and then you'll have so many people chasing after you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled, knowing that her friend didn't want her to be sad. "Let's go! I'm counting on you to make me beautiful tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">---</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Valda Theller wore the new dress she bought yesterday. She only intended to put on light makeup, but Camille Strickland brought a makeup artist friend who gave her an exquisite makeup look. It wasn't heavy makeup, but it enhanced her facial features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The makeup artist also styled her hair, braiding her long hair into a loose princess braid. With her makeup and the light blue dress she wore today, she looked really beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was satisfied with her friend's appearance. "Not bad, not bad. Now even if you're at the scene, you won't lose to those female celebrities."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're exaggerating. If I really stood next to those celebrities, people would immediately be able to tell who's a professional and who's not." Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, you really look beautiful today. Let's go!" Camille Strickland took Valda Theller to the wrap party venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at the banquet hall reserved by the crew, Valda Theller saw that many people were already seated inside. There were also some reporters and photographers taking pictures and conducting interviews.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and Camille Strickland sat down at the table with the screenwriters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several screenwriters greeted Valda Theller warmly, and she responded to each one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One editor asked curiously, "Valda Theller, I heard that you're Brian Hart's girlfriend. Is that true? I heard that Brian Hart was invited to this wrap party by the producers. Is Brian Hart coming today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This question made Valda Theller feel embarrassed. "I... and Brian Hart are not in a relationship, so... I don't know if he's coming or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, I see!" The gossip-seeking editor turned to the screenwriter next to him and said, "Did you hear that? I told you, how could Valda Theller and Brian Hart be in a relationship! In this entertainment industry, so many female stars are chasing after Brian Hart, he can't even choose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The implication was that Brian Hart didn't even like Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland frowned and couldn't help but want to say something to the editor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller quickly pulled her friend and tried to change the subject. Just then, someone shouted, "Brian Hart is here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, everyone at the table looked towards the entrance of the banquet hall. Many people were crowded at the entrance, and a tall figure slowly walked in amidst the initial commotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at the figure. Today, he was wearing a gray suit, looking elegant and luxurious. His bangs were combed back, making his delicate facial features even more prominent.</p></div>
