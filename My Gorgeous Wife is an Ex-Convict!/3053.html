        <h1>Chapter 3051</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he returned to the hall, Jason and Grace were already discussing tomorrow's transaction with the police and how to protect Valda secretly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian also immediately joined the discussion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything, for tomorrow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Phoebe initiated a video call as expected, and Jasmine finally appeared on the screen. Although the little one couldn't speak yet, she did respond to some actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, video conversations are naturally impossible to fake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the video, it's clear that Phoebe disguised her location. The surroundings in the camera are covered with white cloth, making it impossible to identify where the video call was made from!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, the video conversation is also very brief, lasting only 30 seconds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, it can now be confirmed that Jasmine is safe and sound. This has finally put everyone's worried minds at ease!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The funds requested by the other party are all ready. The location of the transaction will be communicated to Valda via phone. After arriving at the transaction location, Valda will then provide the password for accessing the funds to the other party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because the other party requested that Valda only bring one mobile phone with her, she did not bring any other luggage or tools.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But her clothes, shoes, and even the hair tie she used were all high-tech products.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For example, the button allows her to stay in communication with the police, the zipper on her clothes is a camera, and the sole of her shoe has a tracking device that can pinpoint her exact location...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was amazed by all the high-tech gadgets and felt a sense of comfort in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Throughout the journey, the other person kept changing the meeting locations. At first, they asked Valda to wait in a shopping mall, then they had her take the subway, and then she had to catch a bus. Every time they changed the location, it was only in the last few seconds that she had to rush over as fast as she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For example, if you don't catch a specific scheduled bus, the transaction will be considered a failure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Knowing that the other person did this just to make sure she arrived at her destination alone, she used a tactic to shake off the people following her for protection. Even if the transaction really failed, the other party would not give up such a large sum of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Valda had to do it anyway because if Jasmine stayed with the other party for one more day, she might be in danger for one more day. Valda didn't want to take that risk, and she didn't want Grace to be sad for one more day, or Brian to feel guilty for one more day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could do was rush to the pick-up location and bring Jasmine out, no matter what it took.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda finally reached a shaky and somewhat dilapidated suspension bridge, she stopped in her tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking down from the suspension bridge, there is a valley cliff below.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A sign that reads "Stay off the dangerous bridge" is erected next to the suspension bridge, and a railing is installed at the entrance of the bridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, walk across this bridge now," came Phoebe's voice through the phone she was talking to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This bridge is dangerous. If I really have an accident, you won't get paid today," said Valda.</p></div>
