        <h1>Chapter 979</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Warm his hands&hellip;' Grace felt a rush of sadness. 'It was great back then. It was so great when I thought I had a family.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the better it was, the crueler it seemed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He leaned toward her. The face that could turn a woman on so easily got closer to her. "Or is it because of Brian? Since he has confessed to you, now you can&rsquo;t stand my touch?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His warm breath sprayed on her face as he spoke. His beautiful peach-blossom eyes were cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It has nothing to do with Brian," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" His eyes sparkled a little. "In that case, you don't love Brian either?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it matter whether I love him or not? Besides, we're not a couple. We're just brother and sister. So what even if I do fall for him?" She could not restrain herself and the words just blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression changed immediately, and the atmosphere in the car took a dip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt breathless. Jason's face slowly approached her cheek, rubbing it gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was like a light feather that gently fluttered in her cochlea. "Are you going to fall for Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately stiffened. The hair on her body stood on end, and she felt a chill running up her spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, she had a feeling that he was angry... No, it was more serious than anger. It was fury! He was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though his voice and movements were so gentle, he was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I say I&rsquo;ve fallen for Brian, then maybe the consequence... would be too much for me to bear!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm? Why aren't you talking? Are you going to fall for Brian?" he asked again. He needed to get an answer from her today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With some difficulty, she opened her mouth. "I&hellip; I'm not falling for Brian." She had never wanted to fall for Brian. Even after she regained her memories, she just thought of him as a childhood playmate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pressure in the air seemed to relax suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few moments later, his voice slowly rang in the car. "Fortunately, you didn't say you want to fall for Brian. Otherwise..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked up slowly. His bright eyes seemed to be covered with a veil, making it hard for people to see through him. "I wouldn&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do to you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if it would be the end of the world to him if she said she would fall for Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Thankfully, she didn't say so&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a chill running through her. His words seemed more like a warning than a reassurance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even wanted to question him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does he want from me? He doesn't love me, but he also won&rsquo;t allow me to love someone else! Am I just an emotionless doll that can be manipulated into whatever role he wants?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does he think that I could be a lover and a sister?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your hands are so cold. Why don't I warm them for you?" he muttered before lowering his head to start warming her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she had taught him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was warming her hands attentively. He was so gentle and attentive as if she was a treasure he cherished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands were getting warmer, but Grace felt as though her body was getting colder and colder...</p></div>
