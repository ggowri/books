        <h1>Chapter 839</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A familiar figure was sitting near the dining table in her rental house, and his bright eyes were looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is he in my rental house?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason in shock. For a moment, she did not even know how to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips tightly together before standing up. He walked toward her step by step. "What's the matter? Are you that surprised to see me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I not be surprised?' Grace thought bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought that they would never meet again after breaking up, but she kept seeing him again and again these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing him would remind her of the pain of the breakup and... how he had saved her in Drunken Days as well as when she was drunk in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed, what are you doing in my rental house?" She took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Waiting for you,&rdquo; he said out these three simple words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Alright, with his ability, it's easy for him to get into this room. However... Waiting for me?' "Mr. Reed, I don't seem to have anything that requires you to wait for me, do I? You've made everything clear when we broke up. When I left Reed Residence, I only took my things with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face gradually darkened. It was harsh to hear her call him Mr. Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes. When she left, she didn't take any of the things I bought for her. She only took her worthless things as well as... the photo she had given me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you take the photo?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned. Then, she understood what he said. "That's my photo. Since we broke up, I think you wouldn't want to see my photo. It&rsquo;d be better if I take it back before it ends up in the trash."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You gave it to me!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I gave it to Jason," she answered. However, there was only Jason left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words seemed to infuriate him at once. His hand slammed the door of the rental house shut, pushing her against the wall. "What's the matter? Am I not Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it matter whether you are, Mr. Reed? Since we&rsquo;ve broken up, you wouldn't be interested in my photo, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she said this, her voice and her eyes were calm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the calmness made him feel like something was pressed against his chest. It made him feel a little suffocated. "The photo's mine, so you should return it to me," she said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know that when he found out the photo was gone, he almost flipped the entire Reed Residence over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took this photo away from her in the beginning because he was afraid Brian would find it one day. Then after their breakup, the photo seemed to have become something for him to hang on to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if without the photo, he would have nothing that belonged to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you want that photo since we've already split up?" she asked. He was now so eager for the photo that she seemed to have an illusion that he was reluctant to leave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't be silly!' Grace scolded herself. 'If he&rsquo;s reluctant to leave me, he wouldn't have broken up with me and said that he&rsquo;s tired of dating me.'</p></div>
