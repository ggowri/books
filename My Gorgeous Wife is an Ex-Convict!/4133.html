        <h1>Chapter 4131</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina looked at him in confusion, "What are you doing..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sorry!" Kit said, "But holding hands makes me feel a bit more comfortable right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he said this, he seemed a bit embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But once he let go of her hand, he had a feeling that his symptoms might resurface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In that moment, he was afraid that she would let go of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If that happened, would he fall back into that darkness again?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, I see. Okay then, let's just continue holding hands for now," Tina readily agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were immersed in silence inside the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina thought for a moment and broke the silence, "The concert today was great, you all performed well, and many fans were crying. My friend Eugenia cried too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What about you? Didn't you cry?" Kit asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, well... I guess I don't love your other teammates as much as I love you," Tina said. In this group, she only liked Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, in her opinion, Kit's development would be better if he went solo, so she was actually quite happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her words seemed to amuse Kit, and he couldn't help but laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm glad I made you laugh, but you can't tell your teammates what we just talked about!" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit, however, was stunned by her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amused?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Right, he did laugh just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In this kind of environment, he didn't break down because of claustrophobia, but instead, he laughed. Was it all because of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What did she represent to him, exactly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why are you looking at me like that?" Tina asked, confused. At this moment, Kit's gaze towards her was different from usual. He was very focused, as if he wanted to imprint her entire being in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit took a while to avert his gaze and chuckled. "Just find it fascinating."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Fascinating?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah, in this kind of situation, I'm casually chatting with you. For me, it's quite a fascinating experience," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina finally realized, thought for a moment, and smiled. "Yeah, it's a fascinating experience for me too. Being trapped in an elevator with my idol!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, the lights in the elevator suddenly came back on, and shortly after, the elevator started moving and ascending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The elevator was fixed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina and Kit exchanged a glance. Tina's eyes were filled with joy, but Kit's eyelashes trembled and his eyes looked down, hiding a hint of disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If possible, he even hoped the elevator would be slower to be fixed. That way, he could spend more time with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The elevator doors opened, and Eugenia, Kit's manager, and the other members of the group were all standing outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina released Kit's hand and rushed out of the elevator, hugging Eugenia, who had tears streaming down her face. "I'm fine, why are you crying like this? I was just trapped in the elevator for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I was worried you might get hurt!" Eugenia choked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's okay, I'm safe!" Tina raised her hand and wiped away the tears on her friend's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit walked out of the elevator, and his manager and teammates approached him, asking if he was okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm fine," Kit said calmly, looking down at his own hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just a moment ago, his hand was still clasped with Tina's hand. When she pulled her hand away, he felt a sense of loss in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It's like... something is missing, like a void!</p></div>
