        <h1>Chapter 2113</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, another car came suddenly. Martin Weiss rushed out of it. As soon as he saw his mother grabbing Kyla, he immediately came forward and asked, "Mom, what are you doing here? What have you said to Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he looked nervously at Kyla ."Whatever my mother says, don't take it to heart." He seemed afraid that his mother had said something to upset her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Weiss's face darkened. "Don't worry. I didn't say anything upsetting to Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was skeptical, but Kyla said, "It's true. Your mother didn't say anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss seemed relieved. "Mom, what are you doing here..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm only here to visit my daughter-in-law. You didn't tell us that you've gotten married. Kyla's pregnant right now, so it's inconvenient for her to have a wedding ceremony. Once the baby is born and Kyla has recovered, we'll&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Kyla interrupted Mrs. Weiss before she could finish. "There won't be a wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Weiss froze. Then, she smiled. "You're the Weiss family's rightful daughter-in-law. Of course, you'll have a wedding. The Weiss family will organize a grand wedding. You'll have everything you deserve."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla knew that Mrs. Weiss had misunderstood. "Martin Weiss and I are only married temporarily for the sake of our unborn child. We'll get divorced when they're one year old, so there's no need for a wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had no intention of hiding it from Mrs. Weiss that the marriage was meant to be a matter of expediency.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Weiss was shocked as she looked at Kyla in disbelief. Then, she looked at Martin Weiss. Finally, she turned around and got into the car without saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Kyla and said, "I'm sorry. I'll explain to my mother." With that said, he drove away in his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Watching the cars leaving one after another, Kyla bit her lip. Mrs. Weiss's attitude today had surprised her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She thought Mrs. Weiss hated her because her father had a hand in the Weiss family's downfall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... perhaps it was just as what Mrs. Weiss had said. The feud between the Corbyn family and the Weiss family had long been incalculable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Weiss looked at her son. "How dare you enter a sham marriage with Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's not a sham. We've gone to tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau to get a proper marriage license," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Weiss glared at her son. "You're going to divorce when the child turns one year old. That means you're getting divorced in less than two years. Isn't that a sham marriage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Not to me! This marriage is true to me, Mom. I have a marriage license with her. I'm lawfully her husband. On our children's birth permission certificates and birth certificates, we're husband and wife. Besides, I'm the father of her children!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Weiss looked shocked. "Have you... Have you lost your mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss smiled wrily. "Mom, don't you know I've long ago lost my mind? I lost my mind back when I found out that the one who donated their bone marrow and saved me selflessly was Kyla, while Paisley Daniels deliberately framed Kyla but I became her accomplice and pushed her into prison!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It had been so many years since he lost his mind that he had gone hysterical!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Tears welled up in Mrs. Weiss's eyes. "Ill-fated. This is ill-fated! How did this happen? Why... Why do you... insist on having her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, why must I insist on having her?" Even he could not figure out the answer.</p></div>
