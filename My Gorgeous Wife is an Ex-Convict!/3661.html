        <h1>Chapter 3659</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper hesitated. It was true that if it weren't for the circumstances, she might not have officially started dating William. But that didn't mean... "I love him!" she said with absolute certainty. "I don't know when I fell in love with him, but I know I love him now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thin lips almost pursed into a line, and his cold eyes stared straight at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he feel such an unusual pain in his chest when she said she loved William? It was like envy, jealousy, and hatred... twisting his emotions more and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he spoke again in a cold voice, "So why did you wait for me for three hours and want to talk to me now, Lawrence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I want to apologize to you formally. I'm sorry, Lawrence. I really am. I shouldn't have treated you that way back then. If I could turn back time, I would never have let go of your hand," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "Is it useful to apologize now? The idea of turning back time is just self-deception."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remained silent and did not speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, if I grab your hand now, will you let go?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned. What did he mean by that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his hand had already grabbed hers. His slender fingers interlocked with hers. </span><span>"Jasper, will you let go of my hand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice echoed in the silent night. And she, staring at him in a daze, felt the warmth of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people had told her before that he might have died long ago, turned into a pile of bones, and she might never see him again in her lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he stood before her, with warmth, alive and breathing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her lost in thought, Roger leaned down and whispered in her ear, "If you really feel sorry for me, I can let you have both William and me. You can date William and have an affair with me at the same time. This way, you can compare and see who is better, me or William."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were like a thunderbolt, making her suddenly snap out of it and stare at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instinctively, she pushed him away and shook off his hand. "What are you talking about?!" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not talking nonsense," Roger said. "Since you didn't want to date me when I suggested you break up with William at the bar before, how about this proposal? This way, you can still date William, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned. "How could you do this? You weren't like this before..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like what? Like this?" He sneered. "Before, I was obedient in front of you. Whatever you said, I listened and did everything you wanted me to do. I just wanted to please you. Do you want me to be like that again so you can feel like I used to be?"</span></p></div>
