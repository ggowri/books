        <h1>Chapter 1507</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When facing Jason at the time who had been crying and smiling, it seemed that the man was completely engulfed in pain. All the things that Brian wanted to say were stuck in his throat and he could not say a single word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Later on, he immediately took on the task of expanding to the overseas market for Hart Group and left Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Initially, this task did not require his presence. However, he did not wish to stay in Emerald City. It was as though staying in Emerald City would make him feel suffocated and he would only be tortured there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would keep thinking of the past. If only he had not been jealous and ignored Grace&hellip; If he had not made her beg Jason for help instead&hellip; Perhaps she would not have ended up with Jason. Perhaps the events that happened later on would not have taken place either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps back then, he should have just ignored everything and brought her away. Even if she were not willing to do so and even if she loved Jason, he should have disregarded everything and brought her away. Only with that could she still be alive in this world even if she found him disgusting or hated him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, a figure walked toward Brian. Surprisingly, it was Patrick. He was also close friends with Jason. Brian had grown up together with them both.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick approached him and looked at him in astonishment. &ldquo;When did you come back?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's been a few days," said Brian lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why didn't you tell me that you've returned? If I hadn&rsquo;t attended this banquet, I wouldn't have known that you've returned," Patrick muttered in dissatisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don&rsquo;t you know it now?" Brian said faintly. His gaze then swept over to Jason. "I heard that he&hellip; adopted a daughter? He's also very close to his adopted daughter's mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though Brian had been overseas for the past few years, he was still aware of all the news regarding Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knew that Jason adopted a daughter two years ago. Hence, that adopted daughter, along with her mother, instantly led brand new lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There were a few people making a speculation. 'Jason already has a son, there's no need for him to adopt a daughter. Chances are, he has his eyes on that adopted daughter's mother. She&rsquo;s a single mother. He's using the excuse of adopting that girl to get close to her mother.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">To Brian, such speculation was rather hilarious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Given Jason's personality, if he had really taken a liking to that woman, he would not have used such a roundabout method. Besides, if that woman was willing to have her daughter be the adopted daughter of the Reed family, it would mean that she did not find Jason unpleasant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Or perhaps, that woman is thinking of becoming the madam of the Reed family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Besides, back then&hellip; Jason became a madman just for Grace&rsquo;s sake. Can such a person still be able to love another?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'As for myself&hellip;' Brian gently swayed the glass of wine in his hand. Five years had passed and he was still unable to forget about Grace. He even kept dreaming about his past with Grace. Every single time, he would be jolted awake from his dreams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It&rsquo;s too painful to repeatedly experience the feeling of falling in mid-air and being unable to catch hold of anything!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was in such a wretched state, so what more Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick furrowed his brows like a busybody. "You know about this? A few other guys and I have even made a bet among ourselves to see if this woman can win over Jason in the end.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian frowned and said with some astonishment, "You're saying he has let go of Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick's expression immediately became awkward. "It's been five years. Any ordinary person would have moved on, right? Besides, in the past few years, Jason has never mentioned Grace. Even if we accidentally bring her up, it seems like&hellip; he doesn't really care about it anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian was shocked to hear that.</p></div>
