        <h1>Chapter 960</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason regretted asking Grace to come over and cook dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Keep your hand under the cold water. I'll handle the soup," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You?" She was a little surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" He went to the pot, lifted the lid, and looked at the soup. Then, he added a little seasoning before taking a little soup with a spoon and tasting it. Moments later, he turned off the stove.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His movements looked elegant and natural. Grace felt like she was watching a cooking show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason kept looking at her from time to time as he prepared the soup as if to see whether she was keeping her hand under the running cold water from the tap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After running cold water over her hand for about ten minutes, the burn on Grace's fingers was finally relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was still a little red, but it was not a big deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's still a little red," said Jason, frowning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It should be okay in a couple of days," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had just finished speaking when he put her fingertips in his mouth, gently licking them with the tip of his tongue as if comforting the injuries on her fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened. She felt as though all her blood was rushing to her fingertips. She tried to pull back her fingers, but it seemed impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slowly, his licks turned to kisses. Scattered kisses rested on her fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her confused face was reflected in his eyes. She felt as if she was drowning as she looked into his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart seemed to beat faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This can't go on anymore. If this goes on, I'm gonna&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Using almost all her strength, Grace withdrew her hand and took a step back. "My fingers are alright!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyelashes fluttered slightly. His dark eyes seemed to be covered with a veil, and it was getting more and more difficult to figure out what was on his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servant served the three dishes and the soup Grace made. During the meal, neither of them made a sound. The dining room was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace noticed that Jason was being unusually silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they finally finished their meal, he said, "I'll ask the driver to send you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she left, she looked at him and asked, "Are you alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled. "Why do you ask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless. It seemed that she was overthinking, so she said nothing and turned away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark eyes were fixed on her back until she disappeared. Then, he stood up and walked to the bedroom on the second floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bedroom where she used to stay in was now his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All the things she had used previously were still in the room, and every night he would come to this room to hold her clothes to sleep!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He opened the wardrobe, took out a dress she once wore, and held it tightly in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he was hugging his lover.</p></div>
