        <h1>Chapter 1669</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, go ahead," he said as he put the documents on the coffee table in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well... Damian Harmon, the man who claimed that my mentor and I committed fraud in his case and wrongfully sent him to prison, has recently sued us for this matter. The procuratorate may conduct an investigation on me and my mentor regarding that lawsuit. When the time comes, maybe... Maybe there&rsquo;ll be some negative comments that&rsquo;ll affect Reed group..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Are you afraid I might misunderstand something?" Jason pulled Grace into his arms. "I know you respect your mentor a lot. Your mentor helped you when you were in L City, and you're on good terms with your mentor's wife. If random slander from nobodies can affect Reed group, then the Reed family shouldn&rsquo;t stay in Emerald City any longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt reassured when Jason said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was not afraid of the trouble outside. She was only scared that there would be another problem between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll take care of everything. You just need to stay by my side," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt her heart melt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Also..." She hesitated and bit her lip slightly before saying, "Sean saved me when the flowerpot fell today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps the bodyguards or drivers had already reported the incident to him, but Grace felt compelled to bring it up no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was for nothing but peace of mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew he was suspicious and sensitive, so all she could do was try to make him feel assured and be honest with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know," he said and handed her the documents he had put on the coffee table earlier. "Would you like to read this? Sean's life hasn't been easy these years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace raised her eyebrows slightly, took the documents, and looked through them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The documents were about Sean's situation in recent years. The Stevens family had fallen back then. Although Sean tried to build their company back up again, he was tricked and the Stevens family lost all of their remaining money. They fell into great debt. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's life only became increasingly difficult from there. Two years ago, Mr. Stevens died, leaving Mrs. Stevens, Sean, and Stevens Zoe to live together in a tiny rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean worked as a courier, making a living delivering parcels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the report, Grace only felt that things were constantly changing. Who would have expected the once-glorious Stevens family to end up like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared at Grace while she read the report, observing the slight changes in her expression. After she closed the report, he said, "Do you feel sorry for Sean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Feel sorry?" Grace paused a little and looked at Jason in confusion. "Do you think I&rsquo;ll feel sorry for him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her with his thin lips pressed together. Moments later, he asked instead of answering, "You won&rsquo;t, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace replied, "No, I won't. Jay, I won't feel sorry for Sean, and there's no need to feel sorry for him. I only have feelings for people I care about. I don't want to waste any feelings on people I don't care about, even if it's only sympathy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if he's your ex-boyfriend? He saved you this time. Won't you care about him and feel sorry for him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He's my ex-boyfriend, but he was also the one who hurt me. He gave me up for the Stevens family and coldly looked on when Lily tortured me. How can I possibly care about him and feel sorry for him?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason felt a pang in his heart as if a chill had enveloped his body.</p></div>
