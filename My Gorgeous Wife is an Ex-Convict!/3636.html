        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to think that he would be with her forever, just like in the photo. But in the end, it was nothing but his foolish imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he no longer indulges in such fantasies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is her life miserable now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Barlow family, who used to have the protection of the Reed family, no longer enjoys their shelter. So naturally, her days won't be too good either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't that to be expected?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting the photo away again, Mason lies on the bed, trying not to think about anything related to Veronica. Between them, there was nothing left since the day he decided to hypnotize himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Jason and Grace finally saw their second son during breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon learning that their second son would stay in Emerald City for half a year, Grace's eyes filled with joy. Among her four children, she spent the least time with Mason and felt the most indebted to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, young Mason was taken away by Secretary Wylie. The torment he endured in the three years before joining the Barlow family would have driven even an ordinary person insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you're back, if there's anything you need, just let Mom know and she'll get it for you," Grace said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need anything," Mason replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the youngest in the Reed family, Jasmine, was also wide-eyed, looking at her own Mason. She had spent little time with him, and Mason appeared cold and distant, but her sister had told her that Mason was actually easy to get along with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Mason, can I personally receive the birthday gift you got me today?" Jasmine asked. After all, in previous years, Mason would mail her gifts since he hadn't been in the country for several years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the gift Mason gave her, Jasmine was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other people would give her dolls, pretty clothes, jewelry, or other things that girls liked. But Mason gave her a watch, a pen, and a piggy bank in the shape of a dinosaur...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And recently, Mason had directly given her a box of original books.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, according to what she had heard from her mom, the books in that box were all out-of-print and very precious, difficult to find. It was evident that Mason had put thought into preparing a gift for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately, she just couldn't bring herself to like these gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Mason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I request a specific gift then?" Jasmine's eyes sparkled with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at his little sister, "Yes, what kind of gift do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want someone to accompany me to a concert!" Jasmine declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the people present all had different expressions. Jason seemed intrigued, Grace wanted to suggest a different gift for her daughter, but her husband stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked surprised, while Mick had a look of amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rare hint of embarrassment appeared on Mason's usually expressionless face. "I don't like crowded places."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why I consider it a birthday gift!" Jasmine said, as she had never been to a concert with Mason before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can ask your older brother to accompany you," Mason added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick, unexpectedly finding himself involved, quickly responded, "No, I've already accompanied Jasmine to several concerts. Taking her to a concert is not really a birthday gift for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine hesitated for a moment, thinking about what Jasper had said before. Mason, she thought, was the kind of person who would usually agree if you persisted enough.</span></p></div>
