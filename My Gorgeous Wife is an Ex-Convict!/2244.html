        <h1>Chapter 2242</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It reminded her of the last time he had come to the store. He was so pale that even his lips were grayish. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the time, she just thought that he was tired. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if he had really just gotten his blood drawn in the hospital back then, that meant he already started doing it almost a month ago. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then recalled the two nurses in the washroom saying he got his blood drawn once a month!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you come here once a month to have your blood drawn?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression changed slightly, then he smiled and said, "Where did you hear that from? I'm fine. Why would I have to come here once a month to get my blood drawn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her red lips together tightly. She had an answer in her mind, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly walked past Martin Weiss, pushed open the room door, and walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse inside was putting away the bags of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was too late for Martin Weiss to stop her. Kyla had already seen that one of the bags had Martin Weiss's name on the label and that the amount displayed on the blood bag was 400ml.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse was taken aback by Kyla's sudden entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss, you can't touch these blood bags!" the nurse quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla put down the blood bag and turned to look at Martin Weiss. "Do the blood tests require a bag of your blood?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips slightly. Moments later, he finally said, "Why don't we go out first? I'll answer any question you have later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two left the room and went out into the corridor. Then, Martin Weiss said, "What about you? Have you completed your pregnancy check-up today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm still waiting for some test results," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now, can you tell me why you got your blood drawn?&rdquo; asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sighed gently and looked into her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he did not want her to know the real reason, he probably should come up with a lie. However, the look in her eyes seemed to make any lie he could come up with stuck in his throat. He had trouble speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe he did not want to lie to her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "It&rsquo;s just as a safety precaution. Since you want to give birth to this baby, I&rsquo;ll make preparations for everything possible. I&rsquo;ll help you get the best doctor, the best hospital, and the best team so that you can give birth to this baby smoothly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said as he gave a self-deprecating smile, "Besides money, I can only use my body to help you. I'm glad I have the same blood type as you. At least, if you need a blood transfusion during the delivery, my blood can be useful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, are you going to continue getting your blood drawn until I give birth?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." He admitted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really... need to donate 400ml of blood every month?" she asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's only 400ml. That's how much the average person donates each time," Martin Weiss said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But ordinary people don't get their blood drawn once a month!" said Kyla. The average person who donated 400ml of blood at a time would usually be required to wait six months before donating again.</p></div>
