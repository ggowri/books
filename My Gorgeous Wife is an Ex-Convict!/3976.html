        <h1>Chapter 3974</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A woman like this isn't even worth making me angry." Mick's cold voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's body trembled suddenly. "Not even worth it"...these words were telling her that there was a barrier between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has always been someone she couldn't touch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That brief moment of contact was nothing but a ridiculous dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also," Mick turned to the troublemaking rich kid, "don't do these unnecessary things again. If I really need to deal with someone, I don't need you to help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man immediately laughed a few times, pretended to agree with Mick, and then shouted at the waiter in the private room, "Why aren't you leaving yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several waiters and Nancy were finally able to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they left the VIP banquet hall, the two frightened waiters quickly thanked Nancy, "Thank you, Nancy, for today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for you, we would have really..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, just don't impulsively pour wine on customers in the future." Nancy comforted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She breathed a sigh of relief only after the two waiters left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, are you okay? You were poured so much alcohol just now..." A colleague who called her to handle the matter asked worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, I'll go clean up." Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed to clean up after being drenched in alcohol earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy arrived at the hotel's employee shower area, took off her clothes, and stood under the showerhead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warm water washed away the alcohol on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her head seemed to be a little dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bottle of alcohol seemed to be evaporating now, and my head felt like it was turning into mush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Mick again, she still felt the same pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much longer would it take for her to gradually stop hurting?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a shower, Nancy changed into her replacement clothes and walked out of the shower area, only to meet Irene face to face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene's undisguised look of disgust scanned Nancy up and down. "I heard you were being difficult today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy frowned. Irene used to pretend to be polite and deal with her before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a month ago, after her falling out with Mick, Irene's attitude towards her underwent a big change, and she no longer concealed her disgust towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, she wanted to return the teddy bear that Irene had given her as an apology, but unfortunately, the little bear couldn't be found, as if it had disappeared into thin air in her rented room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy ignored Irene and planned to leave on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you showing off to? Mick doesn't want you anymore! Who do you think you are!" Irene stopped Nancy and taunted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's pupils suddenly shook. No one in the hotel knew about her and Mick's relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now Irene could say it so confidently, how did she know?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meeting Nancy's suspicious gaze, Irene proudly said, "I never thought you would use Mick to avenge your mother, but it's good that you did. You used him, so he will hate you and won't look at you again in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know?!" Nancy was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These things should only be known by her and Mick!</span></p></div>
