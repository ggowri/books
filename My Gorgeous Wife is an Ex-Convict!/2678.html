        <h1>Chapter 2676</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Weiss family had a deep foundation in Emerald City. They were a famous family in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Queenie Mack's not the one you can't easily mess with," Gloria said pointedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant looked at Gloria in confusion. "Valda Theller is just a regular comic artist. I didn&rsquo;t hear anything about her coming from a powerful background.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gloria flicked his assistant's forehead. "Why do you think I gave up the other big-budget movie to star in this comic-adapted drama?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's because the crown prince's secretary came to the company and asked you to star in..." The assistant's voice suddenly stopped as they widened their eyes in surprise. "Does this have something to do with Valda Theller?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll find out whether or not she has something to do with this!" Gloria said with a half-smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the third day, Valda Theller continued working on her new comic in the studio because she did not have to go to the film set today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her phone rang suddenly. As soon as she pressed it to connect the line, the producer's anxious voice came from the other end. "Valda, come over to the film set. There&rsquo;s an emergency here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze. "What is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A number of the cast members have gone on strike," the producer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller paused slightly. 'I shouldn't be the one the producer looks for when this happens, unless...' A flicker of uneasiness came over her. She hesitated for a moment before asking, "Is it about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come over first," the producer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller replied, "Okay." She hurried to the film set after ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she reached the film set, she saw several actors not wearing their costumes. Some extras were nearby, mumbling, "We don't care if your cast has gone on strike. We&rsquo;re paid by the day, and you can't renege today's pay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of the production assistants grabbed Valda Theller as soon as they saw her and said, "Valda, go to the meeting room. The director and the producer are all there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What on earth happened?" Valda Theller asked the production assistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The production assistant said with a troubled look on their face, "Queenie Mack and several actors went on strike together, saying they don't want to work with you anymore because of your... misdeeds in university."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller immediately understood that it was probably what Queenie Mack meant by wait and see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she reached the door of the temporary meeting room, she heard a heated argument from inside. "I disagree. You threatened us with online gossip. What do you mean by asking us to kick Valda out if we want you to continue starring in this film? You&rsquo;re not allowing the original comic artist&rsquo;s name to be included in the credits too. How ridiculous. Try to find a film that does that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller immediately recognized her best friend Camille Strickland's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Queenie Mack's voice came. "It's everyone's responsibility to boycott literature and art creators with bad character!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bad character? What proof do you have? Show us the proof. It's all just empty talk. I can say you have a bad character too!" Camille Strickland said defiantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay. Why don't we post this online and have the netizens decide whether we should boycott a comic artist like that?" Queenie Mack said defiantly.</p></div>
