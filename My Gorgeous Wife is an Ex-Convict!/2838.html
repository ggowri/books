        <h1>Chapter 2836</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No way..." said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not? Many people want to suck up to Brian, so they&rsquo;ll also want to suck up to you," Patrick said and patted Brian on the shoulder before saying to Valda Theller, "Speaking of which, my buddy is serious about you. He&rsquo;s attending a gala he refused to attend for you. What about you? How are you going to repay him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller did not know what to say when she met the playful look in Patrick's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian defused her embarrassment by saying to Patrick, "Alright, why are you talking so much? What about you? What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to see if there are any suitable women! I'm still single, after all." Patrick smiled. "Alright, I'll leave you two alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Patrick walked to a group of acquaintances on the other side. Valda Theller turned to look at Brian. "Sorry, I didn't know you weren't planning to attend this gala."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't want to attend because I thought it&rsquo;d be boring to attend such galas alone. It's not boring when I have you with me. There&rsquo;ll be an auction later, and the money will be donated to charity. If there's anything you like, just bid for it. I'll pay," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No thanks, it&rsquo;ll be a waste of money," Valda Theller said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Consider it as doing charity for Hart Group. Even if you don't bid for anything, I'll end up bidding onuseless things for charity," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I see..." Valda Theller said lamely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So wouldn't it be better to bid for something you like?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, Patrick walked over to Phoebe Cross after chatting with a few other people. "Your eyes are almost popping out of your head from staring at Brian and Valda. Is it so hard to accept?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross looked displeased as she said, "Valda? You&rsquo;re calling that woman intimately. What's the matter? Do you think of her as a friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's the woman Brian has fallen in love with, after all," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fallen in love?" Phoebe Cross snorted dismissively. "Brian would never fall in love with such a common woman. He's only temporarily interested in her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Common?" Patrick chuckled. "Don't you know beauty is in the eye of the beholder? It's just like Grace, who&rsquo;s probably common to you too. But Jason loves her deeply. What do you have to say about that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross froze as she clenched her teeth in hatred. Today, she would show Valda Theller how big the gap between an ordinary person and a privileged person was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller accompanied Brian to socialize. Although no reporter dared to interview them, it did not mean that no one came to chat with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Waves of people came over to greet Brian, including some celebrities Valda Theller often saw on TV.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was also surprised to see so many celebrities up close that she found it refreshing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her eyes caught a glimpse of a figure not far away. She froze slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Kyla!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man she had seen on the news next to Kyla was Kyla's husband, Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two stood very close to each other. They looked loving, and reporters were interviewing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you looking at?" Brian's voice rang in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "I saw Kyla and her husband. I didn't expect them to attend this charity gala today."</p></div>
