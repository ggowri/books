        <h1>Chapter 1871</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could use this child to make it up for his parents. Whether they were male or female, they would inherit all the Hart family's fortune after he died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Brian took out a small silver bracelet from his breast pocket. It was the only thing he had that belonged to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He held the bracelet tightly to his chest, slowly closing his eyes and muttering, "Grace..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">To him, it was a name he would yearn for the rest of his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It turned out some mistakes were regrets that could not be remedied in a lifetime!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What? Lina is in the emergency room?" Grace was shocked when she received a call from Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney. "Why is she in the emergency room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney said in a panic, "She took a nap after coming home from the community health center where she took her progesterone shot. She felt a little under the weather and threw up after having dinner. She didn't look right, so we brought her to the hospital but she fainted on the way there. The ER doctor is examining Lina right now, but... I... I'm afraid the doctors here might be inexperienced. Grace, can you help get a good doctor to save Lina? Lina is pregnant, after all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace understood Mrs. Sweeney's concern, of course. She quickly said, "Okay, I understand. I'll get a doctor right away. Tell me which hospital Lina is in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney told her the hospital name, and Grace quickly left the room with her bag, preparing to go to the hospital. She called Jason and explained Lina's situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Got it. I'll ask Terrence to contact relevant specialists in tMason Swansonty to check on Lina!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, then I'll head to the hospital to visit Lina first," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She thought that misfortunes never came singly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she arrived at the hospital, Lina was already out of the emergency room. She lay in the emergency room bed with an intravenous drip attached to her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The doctor couldn't find out what was wrong with her. Since she's pregnant, they can't run some tests but they've drawn her blood and taken an ultrasound!" said Mr. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney also added, "The doctor needs to observe her condition first, but... But Lina and the child's heartbeats are unusually high. How&hellip; How long is the observation going to take?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace quickly comforted them. Looking at her best friend who was still in a coma, she felt like she had gone back to five years ago when she saw Lina lying in the ICU.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she could now protect Lina better!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I've asked Jay to contact a few specialists. They'll examine Lina to see what's really going on," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney finally felt a little relieved. Mrs. Sweeney even grabbed Grace's hand excitedly. "Grace, thank you. We don't know what we'll do without you..."</p></div>
