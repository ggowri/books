        <h1>Chapter 1015</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she had no memory of him or the promises they made during their childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace picked up a piece of pancake and began to eat. 'I&rsquo;m just having dinner with Bryn today.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like their promise, she had come to Emerald City and he was treating her to lots of delicious food!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, a Maserati pulled up slowly and stopped in the neighborhood. Grace got out of the car. She had only taken two steps when Brian's voice came from behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" He caught up with a takeaway box in his hand and handed it to Grace. "These are the pancakes we had earlier. I saw you enjoying them, so I asked the restaurant to pack up another portion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips slightly before taking it. "Thank you." She could not refuse because they were pancakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like... how she could not reject Bryn when they were little and were fulfilling their promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she took the takeaway box, his hand grabbed her hands. His sight fell on her two hands. "You must have suffered a lot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body shivered. "It's all over now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He murmured, "If only I had known you earlier, then perhaps you wouldn't have suffered all this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the first time, he felt so sorry for a woman! He even wanted to take her place and suffer for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her case had been nothing more than gossip to him back then. If the deceased was not Jason's fianc&eacute;e, the eldest daughter of the Atkinson family, he might not have had any impression at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could he have known that the woman who was sentenced to three years in prison for this case would be the woman he loved most in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had known, then he would make every effort to protect her from suffering any grievance and torture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at Brian. In fact... he and she had known each other for a long time. It was just that she had forgotten him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had remembered his words before the accident, he would have helped her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would help her because he was Bryn&mdash;the Bryn who had been through thick and thin with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thanks..." she muttered. 'I'm sorry I&rsquo;m keeping the truth from you and not telling you that I&rsquo;m the little girl you&rsquo;ve been looking for.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not reciprocate his feelings just as he wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a black car nearby, Terrence could only feel the air pressure inside dropping precipitously, making him feel breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He peered warily through the rear-view mirror at his boss in the back seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Master Reed's looking out at the scene. Although he&rsquo;s not showing any expression on his face, the aura he&rsquo;s exuding is simply terrifying!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence could not help groaning in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Speaking of which, Master Reed has been waiting for Grace to come back every day recently, but he doesn't get out of the car to meet Grace. Sometimes, he even stays in the neighborhood until midnight. I have no idea what Master Reed is thinking.'</p></div>
