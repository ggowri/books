        <h1>Chapter 1885</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina found herself getting muddle-headed when she thought of this. It was as if something was pressing on her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson probably doesn&rsquo;t know about it." Grace seemed to see through what her best friend was thinking and said, "I don&rsquo;t think Katherine Jackson has left Emerald City. If Hadwin Stephenson wanted to help her, someone would have taken the blame for her and she&rsquo;d never end up being wanted by the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze slightly, then she looked down and murmured, "It seems that Hadwin Stephenson doesn't love Katherine Jackson or me that much after all." A man like him probably loved his career and success the most. Women were just something to spice up his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, maybe Katherine Jackson visited Hadwin Stephenson's mansion for something else. Maybe it's not what you think," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "Why do you think a man would let a woman stay at his mansion for the night? And more than once? If the Stephenson family wanted to acquire the Jackson family's properties, why couldn&rsquo;t they talk about work during the day? Why did they have to spend the night at the mansion? It must be a private matter, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not think of any other reason either. They could only find out the answer by asking Hadwin Stephenson or Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After coming out of the hospital, Grace went to the kindergarten to pick up her three children from school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The three children were Mick Reed, Jasper Reed, and William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As for Mason, although his name on the household registration record had been changed to Mason, he continued to live with the He family. The little one refused to go to kindergarten, so Grace had no choice but to give up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, the little one was looking forward to entering primary school. He wanted to quickly go to school with Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The kindergarten teacher respectfully invited Grace into the office. Grace saw the obvious injuries on William's face. Jasper and Mick looked to be in better states, but their hair and clothes were a little messy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper Reed's angry face turned into a look of grievance when she saw Grace. "Mommy, the teacher wronged me!" She looked as if she wanted Grace to get justice for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The teacher nearby hurriedly explained that it was because the children were fighting. William was the only one fighting with other children at first, but then Jasper joined in. Mick Reed joined in right away when he saw his sister fighting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The children's parents had apparently told them about Jasper and Mick Reed, so they did not dare to fight with them. They only kept hitting William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, William's injuries were the most serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why did they fight?" asked Grace. After all, in her opinion, William was not a troublemaker. One could even say that he was too quiet sometimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The children only argued a little and William hit them first. The children were badly beaten up, and their parents have sent them to the hospital," the teacher said, putting all the blame on William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William kept his head down and said nothing as if he was acquiescing to everything the teacher said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They called William a prisoner's child and wrongly accused William of stealing their toys. That's why William hit them!" Jasper said indignantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The teacher said to Grace, "They were just saying those things, but the situation escalated when William started hitting them! Besides, a child like William will inevitably be out of place in a kindergarten like ours. For him to progress better, I think you should transfer the child to another kindergarten."</p></div>
