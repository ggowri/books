        <h1>Chapter 561</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a place like the entertainment industry, any straw in the wind would be extremely exaggerated by outsiders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian and her had not made any public appearances during this time, and there were a lot of speculations on set as to whether she was dumped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she urgently needed to appear in public with Brian to dispel those rumors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... She could not even meet Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't you help me out again, Secretary Zhang? I want to see him," Evelyn said humbly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I really can't. Mr. Hart has already said that he won't see you, so he won't," the secretary said that as if there was no room for change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn could even see a faint flicker of mockery in his eyes and some sort of pity as if he was better than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did Secretary Zhang assume that Brian would dump her and that she would become her former self again? Evelyn thought to herself darkly, but for the moment, it would be a disgrace to stay here any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn could only leave first. Then, she found a parking space near the building's car park. She parked her car there and planned to wait for Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She asked for a day off from the set just to meet Brian today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she did not expect was that just a moment later, Brian's car appeared. Evelyn had to hurry to keep up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to Evelyn's surprise, Brian drove for more than 20 minutes with no intention of stopping. He was headed toward the freeway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Where&hellip; Was he going?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Puzzled, Evelyn drove for more than an hour until they finally stopped near a hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn had to park as far away as possible for fear of being noticed by Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She realized that the town they were in was Grace's grandmother's town. As a child, she had come here twice with her father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was Brian here to... Evelyn suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she could only see Brian standing still in front of the hill from a distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was there anything special&hellip; With this hill? Evelyn crept a little nearer but suddenly stopped dead in her tracks, for she had already recognized the hill as the one she saw in the painting in Brian's studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the painting of the little girl carrying the little boy on her back while trudging down the hill. The two children appeared to be dependent and relied on each other&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, standing in front of the hill, was Brian thinking about... Grace? Evelyn's hands were tightly clenched into fists, her manicured nails prickling her palms! Her face, that had exquisite makeup on, began to twist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace helped to clean up the small restaurant. Recently, as Mrs. Corbyn was hospitalized, Kyla had to take care of Nelson by herself, so Grace offered to clean up when they closed for the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, she had to leave work a little later than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got out of the restaurant, she suddenly stopped after a few steps and looked at the figure in front of her in shock.</p></div>
