        <h1>Chapter 882</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What kind of place is it?" Grace's curiosity was aroused by what she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, you'll see." Lina covered her mouth and smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately felt that her best friend's smile looked like the brothel madams&rsquo; in movies and TV dramas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Grace was speechless when Lina took her to the &lsquo;nice place&rsquo;. It was an underground bar, and many of those who came here were 17 or 18-year-old high school students or some in their early 20s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They looked a bit out of place standing there due to the difference in their ages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's so good about it?" Grace wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll find out in a minute!" Lina blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, at eight o'clock, the atmosphere suddenly picked up and five men took the stage in front of the bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just a band singing. Grace did not see anything special about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina's eyes lit up. "Here. Here. They're here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you bring me here today to see them?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. They're pretty popular in the niche lately. The five of them are all good-looking and in good shape. Plus, they can dance really well!" Lina got more and more excited as she spoke. She wished she could introduce the five men to her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that Lina would get excited when she was talking about handsome men. "Aren't you dating Hadwin? Aren't you afraid that he'll find out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I came here without his knowledge!" said Lina. Then, she put on an expression like she was obsessed with these men&rsquo;s beauty. "Besides, I'm just appreciating these men. The one I truly like is Hadwin!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. "You like Hadwin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Lina realized that she had let it slip. Then, while feeling a little embarrassed, she said, "Well... I didn't tell you before, but Hadwin and I&hellip; Um... We&rsquo;re in a real relationship now. It's not the pretend dating and revenge I used to talk about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to wait a while and find the right opportunity to tell Grace. After all, Grace and Jason just broke up not long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the guilt on her best friend's face and suddenly understood Lina's hesitation. She smiled and patted her on the shoulder before saying, "This is a good thing. You should be happy that you and Hadwin are together now. Why didn't you tell me? Is it because Jason and I broke up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina did not say anything, but the look on her face said it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, if you think I&rsquo;ll feel disappointed or unhappy because you and Hadwin are really dating after I broke up with Jason, then you&rsquo;ve underestimated our friendship!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a little smile. "Of course, I&rsquo;m happy for you. I can only be happy that my best friend has finally found someone she truly likes! Therefore, you don't need to feel guilty or embarrassed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina suddenly heaved a sigh of relief and said with a grin, "You're right. I&rsquo;ve underestimated our friendship! Come on, let's enjoy ourselves! Who the hell does Jason think he is? There are many men in this world! I'll find you a dozen pretty boys later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that Lina was talking with such high spirits, Grace played along and said, "Sure. A dozen!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Terrence answered his phone in Reed Residence's study. His expression changed as he said to the other end of the line, "Keep an eye on them... Closely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing the phone call, Terrence looked at his boss somewhat apprehensively and did not know how to tell him.</p></div>
