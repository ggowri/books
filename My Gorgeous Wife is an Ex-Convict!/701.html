        <h1>Chapter 700</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glanced at Brian out of the corner of his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed to notice and turned his eyes to meet Jason's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men's eyes met in mid-air as if engaged in silent competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Jason put a smile on his lips. He put his hand on Grace's shoulders and bent down. Placing his face close to her cheek, he softly asked the question again, "What did you say you were going to give?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only found it irritating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason&hellip; He&rsquo;s doing that on purpose!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he deliberately showing off his intimacy with Grace to tell others not to make any more attempts at her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian felt a tingling in his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When had he gone after another man's fianc&eacute;e?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For his part, he had never lacked women, nor did he care to make any attempts at a woman who already had someone else in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both he and the women he dated had a fully-consenting relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Grace seemed to be an exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because she was too much like the girl he had in mind?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt as if she was surrounded by Jason's scent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was so close to her. She lifted her eyes and could see his eyelashes. "Sis has already had her eye on this gown and specially came over to try it on today. In that case, she can have it. I'll just choose something else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blushed as she spoke. Jason finally straightened up and said with a half-smile, "All right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went up to Stella Lindsay again and said, "Sis, I'll go and change out of this dress later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay could not help but clench her teeth. She got the gown, but now she felt like a failed ragpicker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Growing up, I couldn't beat Grace no matter what. Now, it&rsquo;s the same even with a dress?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'One day, I'm going to let Grace pick up what I don't want!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she thought so, Grace's voice suddenly rang again. "However, did Brian really say to you when he was little that he would give you a purple dress someday?" She emphasized the word &lsquo;you&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Stella Lindsay immediately felt a chill running down her back. She felt as if the hair on her arms was standing on end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a look of horror in her eyes, but she stubbornly retorted, "Of course." However, there was a quiver in her voice as she said these two words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said nothing more but turned her head toward Jason and said, "Jason, will you go with me to choose another gown?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Jason said gently, holding Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Manager Wang hastened to lead the way, grateful that he survived this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Jason's hand that held Grace's with mixed feelings. Just as she had said so easily that she could give the gown away, his heart suddenly ached as if she was going to give him away just as easily too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Give?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why do I feel that way?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Clearly, Grace's relationship with him was far from &lsquo;giving&rsquo;.</p></div>
