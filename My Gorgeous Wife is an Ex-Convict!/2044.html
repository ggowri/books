        <h1>Chapter 2042</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, after she bought all the goods and put them on the tricycle, she found that a tire had been removed. Two seemingly honest young men went to Kyla and said, "Oh, the tire of your tricycle is gone. You can't ride it anymore. There's a garage right next to us. Why don't we help you take your bike over there to have it fixed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla instantly recalled the sellers mentioning how tricycles and electric bikes were getting their tires punctured or removed when she was restocking, which caused the nearby garage&rsquo;s business to soar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Many who went to the garage to fix their bikes were brutally ripped off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Many people in the market speculated that the people from the garage were responsible for all these incidents, but the surveillance cameras installed outside were damaged. A few days after they fixed the surveillance cameras, they would break again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla immediately said, "No thanks. I'll think of something else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What else can you do? The garage is just next door, and it's convenient. We only want to do you a favor. It would take a long time for a woman like you to tow your bike to the garage yourself with all these things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks! I'll figure it out myself," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two people's expressions changed instantly. They stopped pretending to look honest and spoke menacingly, "Don't take things the hard way when we're giving you a choice. You have to fix it over there whether you like it or not!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, the two men wanted to move Kyla's electric tricycle over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said quickly, "What are you doing? I'm calling the police!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure, call the police. You asked us to help you move the tricycle to the garage, and now you changed your mind. We'll leave if you pay us 500 dollars. We can't have done all this in vain, can we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two men spoke casually, but Kyla knew she had run into scoundrels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">500 dollars was not a small amount of money for her. She took out her phone and planned to call the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two men immediately jumped at her, trying to snatch the phone from her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla tried to avoid them, but they grabbed her hair so violently that she leaned backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah!" A scream was let out from her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, a man yanked the hand that held Kyla's hair and yelled, "Let go! I've called the police. They'll be here in a minute! Let's see who's the one who&rsquo;ll be in trouble when we're at the police station!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two men spat at that and snapped, "Damn it! Don't let us see you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, the two people quickly left. Kyla looked at the person who just helped her out... It was Chase Harper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Chase, thank you," Kyla said gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper said, "I'm old now, almost 40. People call me Old Chase. Are you okay? What the hell just happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's fine. It's nothing serious." Kyla explained what had happened while tying her hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper looked at Kyla's hands as she tied her hair dexterously. He could not help but say in envy, "You women have such flexible fingers when tying your hair. I can never do it well. It's a mess every time I help my daughter tie her hair."</p></div>
