        <h1>Chapter 2155</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, after finding out yesterday that she would see Nelson Corbyn today, Jasper kept talking about Nelson the entire night. She also took out her beautiful dress and asked him if she looked good in it and whether Nelson would like it, which made William feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not want her to care so much about Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He only wished that she would care about him alone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Nelson Corbyn put Jasper down and politely walked forward to say hello to Grace and the other children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when he greeted William, William turned his head away and did not respond to Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn did not take it to heart either. He smiled and said to Lina, "Aunt Lina, why don't I take them to see Tina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure," said Lina. She had confinement nannies and maids looking after her daughter, so she did not have to worry much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Nelson Corbyn led the group of children up the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at the impressive team and could not help laughing while saying, "Once Kyla's baby is born, the group of children will get bigger. There&rsquo;ll be eight children in total. How interesting it&rsquo;ll be when that time comes!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"By the way, Kyla, how did your consultation go?" Grace asked with concern. Lina also quickly pricked up her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla then told the two the results of her consultation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you going to continue the pregnancy and deliver the baby through C-section?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah," answered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did Martin Weiss say anything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He... didn't have any comments," Kyla said after a moment's hesitation. She did not want to tell her two best friends about how she was forced onto the operating table. After all, nothing happened in the end, and... she also did not want to worry her two best friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We just want you to be safe!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "Yeah, don't be like me. I almost died. Hadwin and I talked about having another baby yesterday, but he refuses to let me have any more. I think he's a little paranoid after having this one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Has Hadwin Stephenson found out anything regarding the matter of you getting injected with poison when you were delivering the baby?" Grace recalled this and asked, "Let me know if you're lacking manpower for this investigation. Jay has several experts in this area."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thanks, but Hadwin already has some leads. We only know who injected me, and we don't know who's behind this. We don't want to alert them, so we plan to find a way to lure the culprit out," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace thought about it and agreed. After all, they could only solve this issue by finding the culprit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"By the way, Kyla, be careful when you give birth. Ask Martin Weiss to check everyone so that no one can do anything in secret." Lina reminded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "Don't worry. After witnessing what has happened to you, Martin Weiss won&rsquo;t dare to be careless. I'm afraid he'll even look into the doctors and nurses' ancestors."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla forced a smile. With what had just happened to her and Martin Weiss, she would probably... be alone when she gave birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the second floor, a group of children surrounded the crib to watch Tina Stephenson as she slept soundly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All newborn babies less than a month old did nothing much besides eating and sleeping. Tina Stephenson was no exception.</p></div>
