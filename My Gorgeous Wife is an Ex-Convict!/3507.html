        <h1>Chapter 3505</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Veronica wants to keep him out, then he won't go," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hesitated for a moment, but eventually said two words, "Keep him out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, is Veronica willing to forgive him for everything he did to you?" Mason asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" She was taken aback, understanding that he was referring to Lionel's involvement in the kidnapping. Although he wasn't the mastermind, he played a certain role in it. "He's my brother. I hope he can learn a lesson from this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And what about me?" he countered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You?" She was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I did something wrong, would you be willing to forgive me, Veronica?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you didn't do anything," she said strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I want to ask for a guarantee, I'm afraid that if I make a mistake in the future, Veronica won't forgive me," Mason said, and in those beautiful black eyes, there was a hint of hesitant desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt her heart soften and impulsively wanted to agree to all his requests. "I...I will forgive you, you can rest assured."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his words, a curve appeared at the corner of his lips. "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, you're my little brother. Even if you make a mistake, I will forgive you," she said, almost subconsciously emphasizing the words "little brother".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like she's speaking to him, but also to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Little brother...," his eyes, once bright, suddenly dimmed. "I thought Veronica would say that I'm your closest person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course...you're also my closest person!" She said awkwardly, and nervously touched the pendant hanging from her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression froze, "Veronica, then if I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he stopped speaking halfway through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" She looked at him in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing," he ultimately didn't continue speaking. If he begged for forgiveness now, would it seem too deliberate?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it would be better to wait a few more days and choose a suitable opportunity to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Mason thought so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel was released on bail from the detention center, and Archer and Rosalind naturally had a grateful expression!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel was clearly quite frightened after being detained. He seemed nervous and almost paranoid, as if he was experiencing extreme fear. He kept asking his parents whether he would end up in jail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, you won't end up in jail! You just made a joke with your sister and these kidnappers took advantage of it. The Reed family has a good relationship with us and they will definitely help you. They won't let you go to jail!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Reed family? Oh, right. Mason and my sister are so close, he will definitely help me!" Lionel stammered, repeating over and over again, "Mason will definitely help me, he will!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow couple exchanged a worried glance, their eyes full of concern for their son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lionel, are you okay?" Rosalind asked her son anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I'm fine. With Mason here, how could anything happen to me? I won't have any problems, no, I won't!" Lionel stuttered, but his body was shrinking into a ball!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the second day of Lionel's release, the Barlow couple came to the Reed family to see Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as they saw Mason, they hurriedly said, "Mason, could you please come to the Barlow family and see Lionel? His mental state has been off since he came home, and today he kept shouting that he wanted to see you."</p></div>
