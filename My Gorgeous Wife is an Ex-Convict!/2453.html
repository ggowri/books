        <h1>Chapter 2451</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if the Mitchell family tried to take her away by force, they would only be entangled with more rumors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was tired after all the commotion, and she quickly fell asleep. Looking at her best friend sleeping, Kyla was finally relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was normal and not suffering from mental illness. Although today's diagnosis was just a preliminary one, Kyla believed that the follow-up consultation would be fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the ward, Kyla said to Martin Weiss, "Amber Mitchell might finally be proved to be mentally sane and won&rsquo;t need a guardian. It might be the end of this matter, but I&rsquo;ll stay in Deer City for a while longer to keep Amber Mitchell company. You can return to L City or Emerald City. You don't need to stay here any longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stopped in his tracks. "What's the matter? Are you trying to abandon me after getting what you want? Amber Mitchell is out of trouble now, so are you planning to give me the boot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hurriedly said, "No, that's not what I meant! I'm only afraid that your long stay here will affect your work, so I suggested you return."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sneered. "You need to stop acting like you're worried about me. Don't forget that you said you didn't have any feelings for me when we were in Emerald City. Kyla, I've only forgotten my feelings for you. I don't have amnesia. I remember clearly everything you ever said to me." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face paled as her teeth bit her lower lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, several people who looked like reporters appeared out of nowhere. They all had cameras in their hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd gathered around them, and everything they asked was about Amber Mitchell. They were obviously trying to get news from these two people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've said everything I have to say. I have no further comment," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could you have no further comment? We've never heard of the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family having a friend like you. Do you have ulterior motives for showing up so suddenly and proving Amber Mitchell isn't mentally ill?" the crowd said as they aggressively filmed Kyla with their cameras.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla frowned, suddenly feeling a familiar pain in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain felt like the pain she experienced in L City... She recalled the doctor saying that the pain would become more and more frequent as her pregnancy progressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had been in good health after coming to Deer City. She did not expect the pain to flare up again at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss sensed that something was wrong with Kyla, so he immediately asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My belly... hurts a little. Let&rsquo;s go... to the hospital," Kyla said as she endured the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, hold on. We'll go right away," said Martin Weiss as he held Kyla to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the reporters did not want to let them go so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"F*ck off!" Martin Weiss shouted, but the reporters got closer as they asked various questions. They even asked Kyla, "Why pretend? You just have to answer a few questions? Are they so hard to answer? Or are you feeling guilty?"</p></div>
