        <h1>Chapter 1005</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn did not even know that the man she had saved was the one she fell in love with and the one who single-handedly sent her to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ll never let Martin and Kyla Corbyn find out about this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ll be the Weiss family's mistress!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace received the papers from Lawyer Carter, she realized she was going to send them to Hart Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was immediately shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter asked, "Is there a problem? They need the papers urgently. It&rsquo;ll only be a waste of time to use the express delivery. That's why I need you to run this errand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she wanted to avoid Brian, she probably could not work in a majority of the firms in Emerald City. After all, many firms were more or less involved in Hart Group's legal affairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were many legal disputes among the celebrities under the Hart Group in one year alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace came to Hart Group's building with the papers in hand and explained her purpose to the receptionist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, just a moment, please," said the receptionist before dialing the internal line to confirm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was waiting when she saw the building's automatic doors opening. A group of people came in from outside with Brian leading them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was talking to a middle-aged man in a suit next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was startled and subconsciously tried to avoid him, but it was too late. Brian had already seen her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With all eyes on him, Brian walked straight up to Grace. "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone was surprised. The crown prince was displaying a rare gentleness in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the crown prince had always been cold and indifferent to those girlfriends of his. When had he ever spoken so gently?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The firm asked me to send over some papers," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"To what department?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was the receptionist who answered, "The&hellip; The legal department. They instructed to... let the lady send the papers over right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll accompany you to the legal department," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The senior executives and the receptionist nearby were so shocked their jaws dropped when they heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did I hear that right? The crown prince of the entertainment industry wants to accompany the woman to... the legal department?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately felt like a panda, but the problem right now was... she had no choice.</p></div>
