        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will survive, I won't die so easily!" Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You say that so casually, but how will you live if you and Tina don't have a child soon?" Adele stared at her son with teary eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can extract the curse. If we remove the curse from my body, then I can survive," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Chandler's words, the three members of the Hunter family's expressions changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele said directly, "I forbid you to do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter's face grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colin looked at his son earnestly, "You should know that everyone who has done this in the past, except for one person, died. And the ones who survived had their body completely ruined! From then on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know!" Chandler said, "I have thought it through! Besides, I have always been lucky. I don't think I will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, he has always been lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was able to discover Tina's existence so early on, be with Tina, and make Tina fall in love with him, and even after learning about the curse, Tina took the initiative to marry him early...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often thought that his luck was too good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on, Tina disappeared, but eventually, both mother and daughter were safe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His luck still held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's just that he couldn't make Tina fall in love with him again in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as long as Tina lives well, it is already a kind of fulfillment for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that his luck was still very good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colin sighed, "Do you love Tina that much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler said, "I don't want to impose my fate on her. The curse was originally my own business. If I hadn't met her, I probably would have taken a gamble and extracted the curse from my body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the Hunter family saved Tina and her mother's lives! If it weren't for the Hunter family, they would have lost their lives long ago. And now they are doing this. No, I will go to the Stephenson family and reason with them!" Adele said unwillingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom!" Chandler shouted, "If you really want me to survive, then don't go looking for Tina any more. She doesn't owe me anything! When she was missing and couldn't be found, I felt that there was no meaning in living. But when she came back, I wanted to live, even until now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina is his motivation to live!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele's tears fell even harder, "For one Tina, how much are you going to torment yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It has nothing to do with Tina, this is my own choice!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Colin interrupted his wife, his gaze on his son's face, "You know, I have never interfered with your decisions because I always believed that you would make the best choice. Even when you were a child, I let you make your own decisions. But this time, your decision, are you really not going to regret it? If one day, Tina recovers her memory and regrets divorcing you, what will you do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Tina regrets and still loves me, then I will naturally be with her. But if she never regains her memory and doesn't love me, then this is fine as it is," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if she regrets when you are no longer alive? Have you thought about how she will </span><span>feel when she recovers her memory and regrets?" Colin said.</span></p></div>
