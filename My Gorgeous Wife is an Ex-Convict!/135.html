        <h1>Chapter 134</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I wanted to find a more appropriate opportunity, a more acceptable occasion for her to find out.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And yet, this... is possibly the worst way for her to find out.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I was careless to not notice that she was standing behind me but... now that I think about it, in my conversation with Patrick, I don't think I mentioned my identity and yet Grace called out my name.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Which means... Grace already knew about my identity before coming across me? Who told her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason opened his eyes suddenly and instructed Terrence. "Check Grace's phone to see who she talked to recently!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes." Terrence came the hasty reply.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence was able to find out in a moment's time. " Mr. Reed, the most recent call Miss Cummins made today was at 6:35 in the evening. The owner of the number is Lina Sweeney."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lina Sweeney..." Jason narrowed his eyes. "I remember this woman. She's Grace's good friend."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Go and find out who Lina met today!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence hummed in agreement.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">By then, the car had arrived at the entrance of the hospital where Mr. Reed was living.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason and Terrence exited the car. When they arrived at the entrance of the patient ward, Jason glanced at the bodyguard by the door and asked, "Is the Old Master asleep?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"He's not," the bodyguard replied respectfully.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason ordered Terrence to wait outside, then pushed open the door and entered the room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Reed lay in bed, flipping through a photo album.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason recognized the album which was filled with photos of his father growing up. "Although the Old Master constantly complains about his son's failure to live up to his expectations, Dad used to be the pride and joy of the Old Master. The Old Master valued him the most.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And me..." Jason smirked internally. "I'm afraid the Old Master wishes to remove half of the blood and genes within me that I inherited from Mom.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"When I was young, the Old Master would be especially disgusted by my eyes because they look so much like Mom's. As a child, there was a period of time when the Old Master didn't allow me to look at him because he would be disgusted at being looked at with eyes so similar to my mother's."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason pulled out a chair and sat before the Old Master. He said nothing and stared at the Old Master quietly. Both grandfather and grandson remained silent.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, when Mr. Reed had finished flipping through the album, he raised his head to look at his grandson who sat before him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His leisurely posture had an elegance despite him sitting casually. His outstanding appearance and incisive manner in handling matters were sharp and cold-blooded. Under his grandson's management, the Reed Group's territory has expanded exponentially.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In all fairness, my grandson is much more outstanding than my son. However, every time I recall that woman's blood flowing through my grandson, I feel disgusted, as if I have just swallowed a fly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And yet, he's the only bloodline my son left behind!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I looked into it. That woman is Grace. She was Sean Stevens's girlfriend and she was the one who killed Jennifer Atkinson three years ago, wasn't she?" Mr. Reed asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," Jason replied and the corners of his lips tugged up slightly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She's been to jail and she's just a sanitation worker. Do you plan to be with her and put the Reed family in the media headlines?"</p></div>
