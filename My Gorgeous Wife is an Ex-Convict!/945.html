        <h1>Chapter 944</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella would accompany Brian to crowded events, just as if she was his girlfriend. No wonder many people on the internet believed Stella was Brian's girlfriend even though Brian had never publicly announced that the two were a couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Brian had been driving Stella around, giving her resources to work on movies and TV dramas, and taking her to various events as if they were dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew all this because of the advanced internet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every gossip news about Brian would easily be the most searched topic. Sometimes, Grace could not ignore reading his news even if she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was also criticized on the internet for being plain-looking, ordinary, uneducated, and having been divorced. She was arguably Brian's worst girlfriend of all time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people even said that something must have blurred Brian's eyes to choose such a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">the Hart family had never publicly expressed their attitude toward Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, later on, Stella's manager publicly expressed on the internet that they would sue those who defamed Stella for legal liability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone knew the manager. He was a top manager Brian chose for Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, someone like Stella would never have caught his attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, many people believed that Brian must have ordered the manager to make the deGracetion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, as if sensing something, Brian looked past the people around him as his eyes fell on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as their eyes met, a hand suddenly covered Grace's eyes. All she could see was pitch-black.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't look. I don't like you looking at other men so seriously." The cold voice rang faintly in Grace's ears, making her shudder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop fooling around. Take your hand off," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not fooling around," muttered Jason. Those bright eyes were now staring coldly at Brian who was not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian could not help frowning when he saw Jason with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on? Didn't they break up? Why is Grace with Jason?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men looked into each other's eyes. One pair was full of confusion while the other was full of cold jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason knew he was jealous. He was jealous when she looked at Brian so attentively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather, he was more envious of her past with Brian. After all, the man knew her years before him and had even been looking for her all this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Despite all he had done... she still remembered Brian and her memories with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what surprised him was that she did not seem to have told Brian about it. Otherwise, the woman standing beside Brian today would not be Stella!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shouted, "Jay! I didn't mean to look at Brian. I can't see anything if you do this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand seemed to be just touching her eyes, but when she tried to pull it away, she could not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't fall for Brian." His voice rang in her ears again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was speechless. She had no plans to fall for Brian at all. "I won't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good," he muttered as he looked at Brian who was coming this way, then he slowly took his hand away.</p></div>
