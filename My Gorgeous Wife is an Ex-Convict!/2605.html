        <h1>Chapter 2603</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's keen eye saw the ring on Amber Mitchell's left ring finger. "What's with the ring?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's my wedding ring," Amber Mitchell replied with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina asked in surprise, "A wedding ring? You're married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell admitted graciously, "Yes, I'm married. I'm married to a man who died trying to save me. Though he's dead, he's the only husband I have. I feel content to be able to marry him after all these years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said nothing as she had already learned about this from her phone conversation with Amber Mitchell previously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked surprised. When she heard Amber Mitchell talking about her husband, the nostalgia and contentment on her face made her heart ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must love your husband very much," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I love Herman." Amber Mitchell smiled. "There's nothing better than being with the one you love. I'll never have this chance, and I can only be with Herman in my heart, but Kyla still has the chance. I really hope she and Martin Weiss can have a happy ending with her trip to L City this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of Martin Weiss, Lina could not help but ask Grace, "Is it true that one&rsquo;s memory could only be restored after saying the password?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In principle, yes. Of course, there&rsquo;s another way. There&rsquo;s a chance of recovery if one is forcefully triggered." It was how Jay got all his memories back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jay and Martin Weiss were different. Jay lost part of his memory after being hypnotized, while Martin Weiss remembered everything except his feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Could we get the password from the hypnotist?" Lina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "I've asked. The hypnotist doesn't know Martin Weiss's password because Martin Weiss himself had asked for the hypnosis. Hence, Martin Weiss set the password himself too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"&hellip;" Lina was speechless. "In other words, unless Martin Weiss tells us the password himself, no one will know what it is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. Unless Martin Weiss wants to lift the hypnosis himself, we have no other way," said Grace. Martin Weiss was willing to donate his liver to Kyla a second time, but he still chose to leave her and return to L City. One could tell that Martin Weiss did not want to lift his hypnosis at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to lift the hypnosis and recover his feelings from back then. Martin Weiss was the one taking charge of the situation here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had no idea if Kyla could make Martin Weiss change his mind during her trip to L City this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three sighed. God knew what password Martin Weiss had set!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over in L City, Kyla was also pondering the same question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing in the study, she looked at the impatient-looking Martin Weiss and said, "I... I only came in to have a word with you. I'll leave once I&rsquo;m done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought I made it clear to you last time we were at the yard," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took a deep breath and suddenly said, "Martin Weiss, I love you. I love you very much!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stiffened slightly and frowned. "I told you. Whether you love me or not doesn't matter to me anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip before saying, "Martin Weiss, I like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned deeper.</p></div>
