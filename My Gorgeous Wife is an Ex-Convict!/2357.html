        <h1>Chapter 2355</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said nothing and got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car slowly drove away from L City. More than three hours later, they arrived in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Mrs. Corbyn saw that her daughter was sent back in a luxury car with a young man following her and calling her &lsquo;Mrs. Weiss&rsquo;, she immediately asked with some doubt, "Did... Martin Weiss get someone to send you back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Mom," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you and Martin Weiss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a long story, Mom. I'll tell you about it later," said Kyla. Then, she bade goodbye to Mallory Malcom and went back to the store with her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the store, Kyla briefed her mother about her trip to L City, but she omitted Chase Harper&rsquo;s involvement and the fact that she was taken to the hospital because of the pain in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn's expression turned grave as she listened. "So you're going to... be living with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it'll only be for more than a year. He didn't mention Nelson. This place is closer to Nelson's school, so I want you to continue looking after Nelson. I'll live with him and the baby. Most of his business is in L City, so I don't think he'll spend much time in Emerald City. Anyway, we'll get a divorce a year after the baby is born."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When that day came, she and Martin Weiss would have nothing to do with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn sighed. "That's all we can do now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But for the next year or so, you'll have to work harder, Mom," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine with it. As long as you and the kids are safe, it doesn't matter how hard I work!" Mrs. Corbyn said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes reddened as she hugged her mother. "Mom, I&rsquo;m thankful to have you here." No matter how much trouble she encountered, her mother was always there to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn patted her daughter gently. "I'm your mother." That sentence meant everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Kyla met with Grace and Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two were surprised to learn about Kyla and Martin Weiss's agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No way. Uhh... What on earth does Martin Weiss want? Didn't he hypnotize himself to forget his feelings? Why would he want to live a normal married life with you? And... he agreed to divorce later on..." Lina was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Is Martin Weiss... planning to use this time to get over you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled mournfully, "Yes. He said the more people can't get something, the more they want it. And when they do get it, they might find that it's nothing much. I guess I might end up being 'nothing much' to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked speechless. "How can he do that? Didn't he consider the possibility that he'll be more reluctant to get a divorce after living with you?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Kyla shook her head and said, "He isn't the same person he used to be. When I first went to him, he looked at me as if he was looking at someone unimportant."</p></div>
