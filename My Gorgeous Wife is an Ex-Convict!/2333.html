        <h1>Chapter 2331</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Do you pity Kyla? But I think Martin Weiss is more pitiful. Kyla could still live a good life after they separated, but Martin Weiss couldn&rsquo;t. He couldn&rsquo;t continue living at all. That's why he chose to undergo hypnosis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Kyla is probably still in love with Martin Weiss. There might be other reasons that led her to make that decision,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But for whatever reason, she still chose to separate from Martin Weiss in the end, didn't she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's question left Grace speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That only shows that she might not love Martin Weiss that much after all. It might be best for Martin Weiss to forget about their relationship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that perhaps he was right, but the thought of Kyla possibly being given the cold shoulder by Martin Weiss in L City made her worry about her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Kyla did not love him that deeply, it was sad when only one person remembered the relationship. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, stop thinking about them." Jason hugged Grace and said, "Even if Kyla is your friend and you&rsquo;re worried about her, this is between her and Martin Weiss. It's no use worrying about it. Why don't you care more about your husband instead?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She muttered, "How could I not care about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really?" he whispered as he took her hand and gently kissed her fingertips. &ldquo;Think of me more often. I want you to think of me all the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That statement seemed like a spell. Those dark peach blossom eyes shone brightly and alluringly as if they wanted to captivate all her attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart beat violently as she found her fingertips beginning to burn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He&rsquo;s&hellip; trapping me with his looks!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He always did this to her, and it always worked!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was irresistible to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm? Will you always think of me?" He gazed intensely at her as his lips kissed her fingertips. She could hardly control herself from the seductive look in his eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes..." she could not help saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A smile appeared on his lips. It was gorgeous and charming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt her heart jump again. She could not help leaning over and kissing Jason's lips. "Jay, you know what? Seeing you like this reminds me of something I read in novels."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's..." Her lips came to his ear, and she whispered in a coquettish voice, "You teasing little minx."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." He looked at her helplessly. She was the only one who dared say so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I want to tease you." He would do whatever it took to keep her addicted to him and deepen the addiction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved her so much, so... he wanted her to love him just as much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">... </p></div>
