        <h1>Chapter 895</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a little messy." Chase Harper smiled awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's only normal when you start your own business. I actually envy you for starting your own business," Grace said. She had thought of starting her own business at the beginning, thinking that she would open her own law firm after accumulating enough experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... She was only working as a paralegal now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only sigh that things were ever-changing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go through this document. I've typed out the questionable points you've mentioned. Sign your name if they're all right," Grace said as she handed Chase Harper the document in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had already called Chase Harper to explain her intention before coming over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper took the document, went through it, and signed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took it, picked up the pen, and also signed her name on the document. When she looked up, she found Chase Harper looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Is there a problem?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&hellip; must have... suffered a lot in..." he muttered. He did not utter the word &lsquo;prison&rsquo;, but Grace knew what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all in the past now." She smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the past had faded into thin air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Chase Harper felt sad when he saw that smile. He had seen her signing her name earlier. Her finger bones had a slightly unnatural bulge as if they were badly injured and did not heal completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wrote slower than ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this the wound she got in prison?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she had rejected him several times, he still could not help wanting to care for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was about to get up and leave, Chase Harper said suddenly, "Well... Are you free later? I have a gift for Nelson. Can you go with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned a little. "You bought a gift for Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, he's a lovely boy." Besides, he was deaf, so he felt a little more sympathy for the little guy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, we'll go together later." She wanted to see Nelson and Kyla too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They would be moving to G City in a few days, and Kyla had already sold her small restaurant. Everything was ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was doing all this just to avoid Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace and Chase Harper arrived at Kyla's current residence, they found several bags of luggage in the room. The things in the room were much less than what she had seen during her last visit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Nelson saw Chase Harper, he called him &lsquo;Uncle Harper&rsquo; happily. Although Nelson had become more outgoing after installing the hearing aid, he did not get close to just anyone. He was only close to those he was familiar with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Nelson clearly liked Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Chase Harper brought out his gift, a toy bubble gun, Nelson was even happier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bubbles would come out from the muzzle of the toy gun when you pulled down the trigger.</p></div>
