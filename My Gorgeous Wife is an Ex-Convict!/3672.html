        <h1>Chapter 3670</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, Jasper held the invitation to the birthday banquet and planned to give it to Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as she walked towards the chemistry building, she suddenly saw a familiar figure passing through the middle of the tree-lined path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was...Roger! And Lawrence too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, he was standing with another girl, and they were...kissing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Jasper was stunned, just staring at the scene in front of her, until Roger, who was kissing the girl, suddenly raised his eyes. His eyes looked straight at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that she seemed to wake up suddenly and instinctively took two steps back. "I'm...I'm sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her apology startled the girl who was still immersed in the kiss. She suddenly turned around and looked at Jasper, her face full of shyness and embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jasper saw the girl's face, she was surprised. This girl was not one of the two she had seen before, but a completely unfamiliar face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Since you know you shouldn't disturb us, do you still plan to keep watching?" Roger looked at Jasper provocatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and her..." Jasper stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you see what we're doing? Or do you want to watch it again?" Roger said, lowering his head and holding the girl's chin with one hand, making her look up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the girl's face was full of shyness and her cheeks were red, she did not refuse Roger's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger kissed the girl's lips again, but his eyes were looking at Jasper. His burning gaze almost froze her in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stood there in shock and disbelief. He was kissing this girl, but she felt like he was treating her like a tool, not a person. Even in this kiss, it seemed like there was no emotion involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, the kiss finally ended and the girl lowered her head, seeming even more shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like what you saw? Or do you plan on continuing to watch?" Roger's voice broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I came to find you and give you an invitation," Jasper finally stated his purpose for coming today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she rummaged through her bag and pulled out the invitation, handing it over to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger glanced at it, then turned to the girl next to him and said, "You can go back now. I'll find you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," the girl replied softly before quickly leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger took a step forward and approached Jasper, but instead of taking the invitation, he looked at Jasper and asked, "Why are you looking at me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was confused. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like I've done something unforgivable," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe...it's because I didn't expect to see you in that kind of situation," she explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with that kind of situation? We're not in elementary school anymore. We're all adults, and even if we were to have sex, it's not a big deal. Besides, it was just a kiss," he said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at him, as if to him, kissing was just a casual thing, and even having sex was no big deal.</span></p></div>
