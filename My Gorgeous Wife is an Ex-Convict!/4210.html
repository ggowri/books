        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse took a closer look and saw that the people coming were the leaders of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse found it strange. Why would the hospital leaders come to the inpatient department in the middle of the night? Could something big have happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders hurriedly walked up to the menacing man, and the hospital director respectfully said, "Mr. Hunter, I didn't expect you to come especially!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Tina?" Chandler asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital director had already received news from Emerald City beforehand and naturally knew that the unconscious pregnant woman being treated in their hospital was the missing daughter of the Stephenson family who had been in the news before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the hospital director and the hospital's top management hurriedly came to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take Mr. Hunter ther</span><span>e right away!" the hospital director said, immediately leading the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Chandler arrived at Tina's ward and saw Tina in a coma, he froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Kit explaining her condition over the phone and despite him driving all the way here, mentally preparing himself, when he actually saw this scene, he still stood there in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What followed was an indescribable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina, his Tina, whom he had searched for so long, he finally found her, but at this moment, she had a nasal oxygen tube and a pale face lying on the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did it have to be like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he watched helplessly as she was washed away by the water, becoming his nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he sees her lying on a hospital bed again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or perhaps he should be grateful, at least what he sees now is a living Tina and not a lifeless </span><span>body?</span></p></div>
