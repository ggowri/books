        <h1>Chapter 3808</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would Mason think when he found out she was kidnapped again? This time, she wasn't wearing anything he gave her, and there was no locator device either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the reason why Daniel kidnapped her might be more complicated than she originally thought. He probably had someone behind him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you...are you really sure you'll have a lot of money?" Veronica gritted her teeth and spoke, despite the pain in her body. "Maybe...that person is just joking with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that person is not just anyone. Since he's willing to give me money, he will </span><span>definitely give it to me, and he will also help me arrange everything for going abroad." Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica said, "If this person is so powerful, why didn't he kidnap me himself? Why did he have to use you to kidnap me? Besides, I don't remember offending such a capable person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not you who offended him, it's--" Daniel paused suddenly and didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Mason offended him?" Veronica guessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, it's not something you need to know! Right now, all you have to do is wait for Mason to come and save you. Of course...if he wants to save you, be prepared to risk your life!" There was a clear malice in Daniel's voice. "Veronica, since you insist on stepping on me, I will also use you as a stepping stone. This is only natural, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, Daniel seemed to want to vent his anger and kicked her a few times. Finally, she passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she woke up, she found that her blindfold had been removed, her body was tied to a large pillar, and her mouth was taped shut, making it impossible for her to make any sound!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was going on? What did Daniel want to do?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked around nervously, but didn't see Daniel's voice at all. Instead, the surroundings gave her a familiar feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like... the auditorium of her old school!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right, it was her high school's auditorium!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even on the mottled walls, there were still the names of her old high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is... their high school?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica remembered that she had seen news that her old high school was going to be relocated and the original site was going to be used to build a large shopping mall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the place where she was trapped now was a place that could be demolished at any time?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why did Daniel tie her up here? And where is Daniel?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel wanted to use her to lure Mason and harm him. What was Daniel planning to do?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various speculations filled her mind for a moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, there was only her here, and Daniel had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to struggle and break free from the ropes, but she couldn't and there were no tools to use. At the moment, she seemed to be able to do nothing but wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a place that was about to be demolished, and there should be no one coming here normally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she remembered seeing news not long ago that this building was going to be demolished soon... Suddenly, Veronica shuddered. Demolished? What date was it on the news? And what date was she kidnapped by Daniel?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried hard to recall the date in her mind. It was dark outside now, and she didn't know what time it was, but judging by her current level of hunger, it shouldn't have been more than a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So... if she remembers correctly, tomorrow is the day when this place will be demolished?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Daniel tie her up here to...?!</span></p></div>
