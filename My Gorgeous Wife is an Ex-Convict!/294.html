        <h1>Chapter 293</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only managed to remember the first three and last digits of the license plate number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Immediately, Grace felt a burst of coldness spreading through her body. What happened? Who the hell were the people in the car? Why did they take Lina?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now Lina...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was this considered kidnapping? Or... Grace subconsciously took out her phone and wanted to call her best friend, but she did not know what kind of situation her best friend was in right now. If she called her, it might make things worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands began to shake until they could barely hold her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With difficulty, she managed to dial 110 to call the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After reporting the incident, she hurried to the parking lot management office. There were surveillance cameras in the parking lot. There should be surveillance footage of when the car took Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nothing could happen to Lina, nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was all Grace had in mind at the moment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason got a call from Grace, he could only hear sobbing noises coming from the other end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just the sound of it made his heart leap instantly. "What happened to you? Say something?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, can you help me find Lina... I'm begging you. Help me find Lina..." Grace said as she sobbed, not knowing whom to go to after calling the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fingers subconsciously dialed his number... The number came with the phone he had bought her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned. "Did something happened to Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She was taken away. I don't know where... The police... The police were here. The parking lot surveillance cameras are broken... Jason, please help me. I beg you to help me find Lina..." she said, stammering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could almost imagine how she was feeling at the moment. Normally, she would call him Mr. Reed, but now, she was calling him &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;. This was enough to show what a mess her current state of mind was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you now?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm in front of the police station..." she replied, choking up. After she reported the case to the police, she was told she could leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Lina was not found yet! How was she going to find Lina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Which police station?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she gave him the exact address of the police station, he said, "Go wait inside the police station. I'm coming over now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he drove up to the police station, he saw her standing on the steps, holding her phone tightly in both hands. Tears were visible on her pretty face. Her eyes were red, and there were hardly any colors in her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it was almost May, the nights were still cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hurried up to her and took her hand. Sure enough, her hands were cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The veins on the back of her hand burst as her fingers gripped the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't I tell you to stay inside the police station? Why are you standing outside?" His tone was vaguely displeased after seeing that she did not know how to take care of her health and stayed out on a night like this. Did she not know that she could get sick like this?</p></div>
