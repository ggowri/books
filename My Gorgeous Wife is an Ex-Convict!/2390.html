        <h1>Chapter 2388</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I... want to save Amber Mitchell!" Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He asked in reply, "Just because she asked you to save her, you think she's normal and not mentally ill?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "Even if she's mentally ill, she shouldn't be abused. We saw with our own eyes what the nurses and her sister did to her! Her sister doesn't deserve to be her guardian!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to deprive her of guardianship, you must have evidence to show that her sister is abusing her. But if the guardianship is transferred, it&rsquo;ll be transferred to her father or stepmother. Do you think that her father and stepmother are unaware of what she's suffering in the mental hospital?" Martin Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "There's another way. Amber Mitchell is normal and isn't mentally ill. We can evaluate her mental state to prove that she's normal!" That way, Amber Mitchell did not need a guardian and she could get Amber Mitchell out of the mental hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She has been in the mental hospital for so many years. Even a regular person would become mentally ill after being locked up in a mental hospital and receiving so-called mental treatment for so many years. Do you think she's still normal?" Martin Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. Indeed, any regular person would have lost their mind after being tortured for years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... the look in Amber Mitchell's eyes when she asked her to save her in the end... made her think that Amber Mitchell was sober!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It isn't as simple as you think. If you want to reevaluate her mental state, it&rsquo;ll alarm the Mitchell family. If they refuse, we won't be able to do it unless we take her away and send her to another authoritative hospital. I can do that because I know some people in the hospital, including Director Wang. But if I'm going to end up putting the hospital in a difficult spot, do you think these connections will help?" Martin Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent, understanding what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Amber Mitchell's reevaluation proved that she was not mentally ill, the hospital would surely get into trouble for keeping Amber Mitchell in the hospital for so many years. It might even involve many people. The hospital would not want its patients to go elsewhere for a reevaluation either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said after a while, "What if we forcibly take her away to be reevaluated?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If Amber Mitchell isn&rsquo;t mentally ill, we won&rsquo;t have a problem taking her away by force. But what if Amber Mitchell is mentally ill? The consequences might be more than a couple of apologies. You could even get detained or sentenced," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla quivered. 'If that's true, then Amber Mitchell...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I take responsibility for it? Just say I&rsquo;m the one who gave the instructions for everything? Can we just take Amber Mitchell out for an evaluation first?" Kyla said. Nevertheless, she was willing to gamble that Amber Mitchell was not mentally ill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was the only way to save Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take responsibility?" Martin Weiss sneered. "Do you want to be detained while pregnant? Or do you want the news to talk about how the wife of the chairman of Weiss Group knew she was breaking the law, yet she forcibly took a mental patient out of the hospital? Don't forget. We're still married. Whatever you say or do not only represents yourself but also the Weiss family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lower lip so tightly that she could not speak.</p></div>
