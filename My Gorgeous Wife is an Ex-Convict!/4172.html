        <h1>Chapter 4170 Buried for a Lifetime</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When did she become important to him? It seemed that originally, she was just a fan to him, a fan who was slightly different from the others!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But gradually, thoughts of her started occupying his mind more and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He couldn't help but want to see her, and even... touch her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even though he knew she already had Chandler by her side, he still couldn't help but wonder... if he had met her earlier, would he have had a chance?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina didn't expect Kit to call her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Can we meet?" Kit said softly over the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina thought for a moment and replied, "Okay, where should we meet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The next day, Tina arrived at the meeting place she had agreed upon with Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was a secluded scenic area in the outskirts. Because it was a weekday, there weren't many people around, and it was very tranquil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "There shouldn't be anyone to bother us here, and we don't have to worry about being photographed by reporters," Kit said to Tina. "Thank you for agreeing to meet me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why did you ask me to meet?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her unfamiliar tone made Kit's face darken. "Do you hate me now?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina looked at him but didn't say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm sorry for my impulsiveness last time. It was my dirty thoughts that influenced how I saw you," he apologized in a hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her gaze made him feel particularly uncomfortable. It felt like something was blocking his chest, making it hard for him to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina looked at the person in front of her. While she was angry when she misunderstood him at first, it seemed like she didn't care anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's okay, I've already let it go," Tina said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit pursed his lips awkwardly, "Will you stop liking me from now on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was taken aback, staring directly at Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit said dryly, "I only meant... am I no longer your idol?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I don't know," Tina replied truthfully, feeling a bit complicated about her feelings for Kit since that incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> On one hand, she was angry that her good intentions were so misunderstood by Kit, feeling like a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But on the other hand, she also pitied him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit forced a bitter smile, "Seems like I'm really foolish." Foolish enough to push her away with such actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Anyway, I've let it go and I hope you have a successful career in the future," Tina said. "I might still go and see the movies or concerts you act in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After saying that, Tina turned around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Wait!" Kit called out. "Besides wanting to apologize, I asked you out today to ask if you're really getting married to Chandler."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, the wedding will be held in about a month," Tina said. Although it was a short timeframe, it was not a problem for families like the Stephenson family and the Hunter family, who were from prominent backgrounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even with just a month, they could have a grand wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you... love him?" Kit asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Very much," Tina answered with a smile. When it came to Chandler, her previous distance seemed to have turned into sweetness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A complex look flashed in Kit's eyes. It turned out, he really had run out of time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> That love, which couldn't be expressed in time, might just have to be buried in his heart forever!</p></div>
