        <h1>Chapter 237</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only a little past five o' clock. No average family would make breakfast so early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"From now on, breakfast will be ready according to your working hours. Sis must eat breakfast before going to work," Jason said and led Grace to the table before gently pressing her shoulders to get her to sit down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace obediently sat down and looked at the breakfast on the table. There was a wide variety of Chinese and Western dishes. At last, she drank a glass of milk, ate a bowl of porridge, as well as some pastries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This breakfast was much sumptuous than the simple two-dollar steamed bun she usually bought in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It also made her realize that she was really and actually staying in the Reed Residence instead of her small rented house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll ask my driver to drive Sis to the Sanitation Service Center later," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. I'll take the bus," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not anywhere near to your Sanitation Service Center. If you take the bus, you have to make two transfers. Aren't you afraid you'll be late?" He looked at her casually, as if he was confident with everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was dumbstruck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After breakfast, the Reed family's driver drove Grace to the Sanitation Service Center in a silver Maybach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sitting in the car, Grace was amused. She had the cheapest job, but to drive her to work in such an expensive car seemed like an irony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace told the driver to park 500 meters away from the Sanitation Service Center so that she could get out of the car and walk the remaining way there. If the driver really sent her to the entrance and she was seen by her colleagues, it would probably set off another rumor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the dressing room, she changed into her work clothes. Although she had applied the back of her left hand with ointment, it was still painful. She was even struggling with simple movements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having changed into her work clothes and taken her tools, Grace, as usual, swept the road that was her and Claire's responsibility. However, Claire noticed that Grace's hand was a bit awkward. She could not help asking, "What happened to your hand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. It just got hit by something. I hurt the back of my hand a little, but only a little," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Claire said, "Then sweep slowly today. Don't use your hand too much. I can sweep more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Claire," Grace said gratefully. After partnering up with Claire, Claire had helped her a lot. Before coming to work today, Grace had been worried that her hand injury would slow down their work today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mention it. These two roads are swept by you and me. If I get tired one day, you can sweep more for me," Claire said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them headed back to the Sanitation Service Center canteen around noon for lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the canteen, someone was talking about the influencer's live stream on Jason last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Normally, any content that recorded Jason's full face would have disappeared from the internet long ago, but this time, although the influencer had already deleted the live stream, someone managed to capture Jason's scene in the video and spread it everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strangely enough, these videos had not been deleted even until now. So many people finally saw what Emerald City's Young Master Reed looked like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people were marveling at Jason's looks. Although there were some comments about his good looks already floating around on the internet, people only realized that his looks were not good but excellent when they saw proof of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many female netizens were saying that they want to apply for a job in the Reed Group. Even if they were only working as a clerk, they would be happy even if they could see him once in a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason's scarf and gloves last night look really special. They look a bit old, though. If someone else wears them, they'll look like they've been wearing them for years, but when he wears them, it's somewhat special."</p></div>
