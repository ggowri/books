        <h1>Chapter 3897</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Clarissa became more and more excited, and even wanted to move her feet and walk over to chat with Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, just as she took a step forward, Mick had already looked away and started chatting with William beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa suddenly felt embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa, what's wrong?" Francis Schultz asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing..." Clarissa glanced at Mick again, "Dad, doesn't our family have business dealings with the Reed family? We should go and toast with them at the banquet later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course." Francis looked around, "Where's Nancy? Why hasn't she come yet? The wedding will start soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Francis turned to his wife Eileen Santos and said, "You call Nancy and ask her to come back to the banquet hall quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eileen was about to make the call when Clarissa spoke up, "No need to call. I saw her earlier, and she said she wasn't feeling well and went back first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Francis was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eileen was also surprised, "Why did Nancy leave early?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, don't you believe me?" Clarissa said unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't mean it that way, I was just... surprised," Eileen explained quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, this is the Reed family's wedding. If she's not feeling well, it's better for her to leave early. We can't have any embarrassing incidents at this wedding," Francis said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm, you're right," Eileen obediently agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's lips curled into a smile. Ha! People like Nancy have no right to attend a wedding like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding proceeded on time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, unlike other weddings, the bride did not walk down the aisle with her father. Instead, she walked alone, holding her bouquet, towards the groom waiting on the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guests attending the wedding naturally knew about the bride's estrangement from her original family, so they were not surprised by this scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, some people still secretly looked down on the bride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the bride's family background was ordinary, and her appearance was only average. In the eyes of others, she was not worthy of Mason from the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica didn't know how many of the guests who came today were genuinely wishing them well, how many were trying to please the Reed family, and how many were here to watch a joke. At this moment, all she could see was the man standing not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the man who had grown up with her since childhood and would be the one to accompany her for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the man she deeply loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, the Reed family had suggested that Uncle Reed replace her father and walk her down the aisle, or find a male elder to walk her down the aisle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since she had chosen to break ties with her original family, she would walk to Mason's side by herself. From now on, even if she had no family to support her, no so-called maternal family, she would be independent and strong, and would walk happily with the person she loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica walked step by step towards Mason, the man who had been by her side all her life. His once cold and indifferent face now had a gentle smile, and he reached out his hand towards her.</p></div>
