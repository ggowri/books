        <h1>Chapter 1629</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was her Jay. She would treat him as gently as she could!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace kissed Jason just like this. She was slightly gasping when the kiss was over. "Do you get it now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He looked at her intently, and his thin lips parted. "Grace, can you love me a little more?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What he said was like a spell, suddenly giving Grace the desire to want him... She wanted the man in front of her so badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She pushed him down on the bed and undid his bathrobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He lay down obediently, his dark eyes staring at her as if he could not get enough of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, smile. I like to see you smile," muttered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," he responded gently. A smile appeared on the corners of his lips. It was so beautiful and charming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would give her anything she wanted&mdash;his body, his smile, and even his soul. He was afraid that one day, she would stop wanting him and what he gave was no longer good enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace almost drowned herself in Jason's smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She leaned over and kissed his face, his nape, his graceful neck...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, we'll be together forever..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said as their fingers intertwined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Forever...' He felt her kisses on him and had another flashback of her throwing up at the sink before looking at him with a pale and weak face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not even dare to reach out and touch her back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He just hoped everything would be as she said, that they would be together forever...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Lina went to work the next day, she found that many of her colleagues were looking at her from time to time and whispering behind her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not take it seriously until a colleague, who was on good terms with her, reminded, "Lina, check the office forum."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina opened the forum and immediately understood what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Someone had made a post on the office's internal forum with the title: [Came across a colleague being a homewrecker]. Two photos were included. One was of Hadwin Stephenson pulling her into the hotel, while the other was her coming out after changing into another set of clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The photo of her coming out of the hotel showed most of her face, so anyone who knew her would recognize her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could not help but frown. 'Who took this photo? Who hates me so much that they&rsquo;d post it on the office forum?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Holly Greer's voice rang out. "What's the matter? Are you looking at your gossip too? Oh, Lina, I thought highly of you before. I thought you were virtuous, but you went to a hotel with Hadwin Stephenson as soon as he came to Emerald City. He has a girlfriend! And the news said he and his girlfriend are getting married soon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina turned her head to see Holly Greer's face that was full of triumph and sarcasm. It seemed she thought she could trample on Lina and berate her as much as she could.</p></div>
