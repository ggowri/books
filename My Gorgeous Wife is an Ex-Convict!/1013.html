        <h1>Chapter 1012</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. It's an old illness. Jason has also taken me to see a specialist," said Grace as she pulled back her hand. The doctor had made it clear that the optimal treatment period for her fingers had long passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the medicine she took afterward was just to ease the pain she felt when the weather was cold and humid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're already here anyway. Just let Dr. Russell have a look. Dr. Russell doesn't see patients easily," said Brian as he dragged Grace into the small clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only see a deserted clinic. An old man in a white coat and a scruffy white beard was sitting in a chair. On the wall in front of him was a 32-inch TV, playing a cheesy sad romance TV series that was a hit these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had heard her colleagues talking about the TV series in the office. It was said to be a real tear-jerker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The old man was watching attentively with a serious expression on his face, almost as if he was watching a documentary show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Dr. Russell, is it possible that Aunty has been a fan of this TV series recently?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The old man called Dr. Russell immediately turned his head around. When he saw Brian, he could not help complaining, "Can your company make some less cheesy dramas? My wife has been binge-watching it every night and forces me to watch it with her. I even have to tell her what I learned afterward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could he watch such a cheesy drama? Therefore... he could not tell her his thoughts afterward. His wife started to lose her temper. She even involved his lack of concentration in watching TV with her into their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he did not concentrate on watching TV with her and inserted himself into the story, he was not treating their marriage and relationship seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An old man like him could only watch such a cheesy drama just so he could &lsquo;discuss&rsquo; it with his wife at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hart Group isn&rsquo;t producing this show," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell choked and said in a snarl, "What are you doing here today? You even brought a woman. Don't you know I like peace and quiet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "You opened an orthopedic clinic. Of course, I brought someone to have their bones checked. She injured her hands before. They&rsquo;re now not that flexible when she writes, holds chopsticks, and so on. Don't you claim to be the best orthopedic doctor in Emerald City? Let's see if you can cure this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Claim? I am the best." When it came to his major, Dr. Russell changed his demeanor immediately and asked Grace to sit down in the chair. "Show me your hands!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace reached out her hands. Dr. Russell looked at Grace's hands carefully, and his face grew grave. "Have you had all your fingers broken before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace answered, "Yes." She had thought this was the ultimate pain, but she realized there was more pain waiting for her later in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was stunned when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She had&hellip; all her fingers broken?' He only thought her hands were injured in some way, but he never expected them to be so badly injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did your nails grow out afterward? Were they pulled out before as well?" asked Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," Grace said again, a little surprised that Dr. Russell noticed it.</p></div>
