        <h1>Chapter 1263</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was almost time for the birthday party to start, and the people around her began discussing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, could it be that Young Master Hart isn't even planning on coming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She wasn't beaten by the crown prince yesterday, was she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I knew it. How could the crown prince be interested in a woman like that? She's unsophisticated and ugly. She can never be a socialite even no matter how expensive the clothes she wears are."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard that she got Young Master Hart's support because she helped Young Master Hart when she was a child. But a person like her can't become an upper class lady even if she marries a rich man."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People were speaking more and more sarcastically while Stella only grew embarrassed. She immediately took the microphone and told everyone that Brian was busy and might be late. "Here are some clips from the first drama I acted in. Take a look, and I hope to work with you someday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella stood under the big screen with a smile. She planned to use her &lsquo;acting skills&rsquo; in the drama to give people who looked down on her a good slap in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted them to know that she had some acting skills apart from the resources Brian gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella smiled as she waited for everyone to praise her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, when the screen lit up, everyone was surprised and stared intently at the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was proud, thinking the others were amazed by her performance, but Stella's smile froze as soon as the sound played.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, help me carry those things to the car. I can't carry them myself. Why don't you get into the car first? Sorry for the trouble..." It was her voice! It was what she had said when she tricked Chase Harper to get into her car that day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella immediately turned her head around and stared at the big screen in shock. It was not a clip from her drama. It was a candid video shot in her car back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When... was a mini spy camera installed in the car?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Stella had no time to think about it. She only hurriedly shouted, "Hurry... Hurry up and turn it off! Turn the screen off!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the staff operating the machine hurriedly said, "I... I can't turn it off!&rdquo; The machine's buttons suddenly failed, and there was no way to turn it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then unplug the power source!" Stella said exasperatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the video continued to play on the screen even after they unplugged the power source. In the video, Stella saw herself saying to Chase Harper, "It's all because you know Grace. Consider yourself unlucky!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she tore her own clothes off and screamed on purpose. She quickly ran out of the car, leaving Chase Harper behind, looking flustered and with a reddened face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this point, anyone could see that Stella had deliberately set up the unfortunate man in the car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the video ended, it repeated itself and played from the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tsk tsk. What good acting! No wonder a newcomer can play such an important role in the drama."</p></div>
