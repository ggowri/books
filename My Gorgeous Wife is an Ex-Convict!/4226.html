        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, by the way," Tina suddenly said, "I heard that you haven't seen the child yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want me to go see her?" Chandler asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you claim to be my husband, the child's father, then isn't it only natural for you to go see her? Or is it because the placenta was lost during childbirth, and you can no longer be </span><span>treated, so this child is no longer important to you?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler tightly pursed his thin lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not that the child was unimportant, but he didn't know how to face the child with what kind of emotions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always wondered if she wouldn't have suffered so much if there wasn't this child, if she wouldn't have gone through so much danger again this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The existence of that child had almost caused him to lose Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Tina survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Tina really lost her life in this accident because of the existence of this child, perhaps he would have killed the child himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when this thought crossed his mind, he was horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not what you think," Chandler denied after a long pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what is the reason that you don't want to see the child now?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina didn't seem to intend to wait for his answer either, she just said, "I'm tired, I want to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you can leave, I want to rest quietly alone," she said again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're still a patient now, you need someone by your side," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you can let the nurse come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face looked a bit unpleasant, the color draining slowly from his face, "Do you hate me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina said, "It's not hate, right now you're like a stranger to me, there's nothing to hate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what Tina said, Chandler became even more upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is there nothing to dislike, and likewise, nothing to like either, is that how it is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler walked out of Tina's hospital room feeling a bit lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, he found himself in the neonatal ward, looking at his and Tina's daughter through the transparent floor-to-ceiling glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little body lay there, much smaller than normal babies due to being premature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were tubes attached to her body, but her hands and feet would occasionally move, as if telling everyone that she was already a life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at the tiny body, and his eyes involuntarily became moist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a complex emotion surged in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had resentment towards this child before seeing her, now there was a strange affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it the bond between father and daughter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That indissoluble connection through blood?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Tina hadn't had an accident, how would he and Tina have welcomed this child with joy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry..." Chandler said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, the person he resents the most is himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was him who failed to protect Tina, it was him who allowed the child to be born prematurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If back then, when Tina fell into the water, he had held onto her, or if he had found Tina before Kit, maybe things wouldn't have escalated to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one who was wrong is him, so what right does he have to blame this child!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is the child that Tina fought so hard to bring into the world!</span></p></div>
