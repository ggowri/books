        <h1>Chapter 1718</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina bit her lip and said nothing. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson laughed bitterly. "It seems that you'd rather let me be in pain, huh?" He said nothing more after that, lifting his feet to walk away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina watched the figure disappear into the night before crouching down as if she was exhausted. She wrapped her hands tightly around her knees as her nose felt sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wanted to cry but could not, and her mouth had a bitter taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How did things turn out this way between us? What should I do? I&rsquo;ve finally made up my mind, but why do I keep wavering because of him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean never expected to see Lily again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Lily was different from the woman he remembered. She wore plain cheap clothes, and her frizzy hair was carelessly tied up with a rubber band. Her face was as gaunt as if she were in her 40s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">People who were unaware would not believe that she was once deemed a goddess by countless men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Sean did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? You don't recognize me after not meeting for so long?" asked Lily. They were in KFC, and there were all kinds of people going in and out. Hence, they did not stand out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No one here would have guessed that the man and woman conversing were once a sensational couple in tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They became the talk of tMason Swansonty when Sean put up advertisements for their love vows all over tMason Swansonty in conjunction with the marriage between the Stevens and Atkinson families!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, they were now down and out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean said, "Long time no see. Your parents have been looking for you for years. Have you gone to see them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No." Lily shrugged. "What's the use of going to them with my current identity? The Atkinson family can't protect me anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean instantly realized that Lily was now a fugitive. He did not know the exact details about the incident of Grace falling into the sea, but one thing was clear&mdash;Lily was involved in it and was wanted by the police!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you going to turn yourself in?" asked Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Turn myself in?" Lily laughed out loud as if she heard a joke. "Why should I turn myself in? I did the right thing. Grace made the Atkinson family and me so miserable. Shouldn't I seek justice?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's brows furrowed with dissatisfaction. "It was you who dragged the Atkinson family into this mess. If you hadn't done those things, the Atkinson family wouldn't have turned out the way they did. Even the Stevens family..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He paused and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily laughed sarcastically. "Do you think I'm the reason the Stevens family ended up this way? Sean, weren't you the one who was desperate enough to abandon Grace and be with me? You brought this upon the Stevens family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you hadn't framed Grace, how could this have happened to me?" Sean bellowed with a hint of reluctance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had accepted his fate. However, after seeing Lily, he could not help thinking that if she had not done those things, he would have continued dating Grace and maybe married her. Then, the Stevens family would not have been the target of Jason's wrath. Things would not have ended up like this.</p></div>
