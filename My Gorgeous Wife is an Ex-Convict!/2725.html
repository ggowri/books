        <h1>Chapter 2723</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, he would not have bothered to attend such a banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I see. Okay, I'll see you tonight, then," Patrick said with slight embarrassment. Then, he ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked to the car, opened the door, and got in. He started the car and slowly drove out of the underground car park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would see Grace again tonight. If Grace wanted to be relieved, he would give her that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could do anything that Grace wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He recalled what had happened on the hill. She held on to his hand and never let go even though it was dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, her little body carried him on her back with all her strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, he had vowed to be good to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The childhood oath had become a thought he could not erase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car arrived at the destination, Brian got out and entered the studio. After seeing Brian, the manager hurriedly went forward and said, "Mr. Hart, Miss Theller has arrived and selected a gown. She's putting on makeup in the makeup room right now. Mr. Hart, would you like to wait here in the lounge or... the makeup room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go to the makeup room first," said Brian. Since he was here, he wanted to greet Valda Theller first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was slightly dumbfounded as soon as he saw Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's makeup was almost done. As soon as she saw Brian, she got up and greeted him. "You came." She wore a gown and elaborate makeup. Even her hairdo was carefully done by the stylist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost could not recognize herself when she saw herself in the mirror. Her pretty face now looked seductive and classy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked blankly at the person in front of him. The purple gown, makeup, and hairdo reminded Brian of the first time he took Grace to a banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, Grace had worn a purple gown just like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Purple... is Grace's color. Grace once said she loved purple, so I kept collecting purple dresses year after year, hoping I could one day find Grace and give them to her.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... he still lost her in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Valda Theller could not help asking when she saw Brian's blank gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather than surprised, he seemed to be looking through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes gradually turned clear from his previous trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Get another gown. This color doesn't suit you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Valda Theller froze before looking down at her gown. 'It doesn't suit me? I think it's pretty.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get it changed," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes," the manager nearby answered hurriedly before quickly leading Valda Theller back to the dressing room to choose a gown that suited her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller did not know what to pick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked over and looked at the makeup Valda Theller was wearing. He picked up a long dark pink dress and said, "Let's go with this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Brian's choice of gown. There was no denying that Brian had good taste. The gown was luxurious but not old-fashioned. Instead, it was vaguely playful, which was quite suitable for her age and today's makeup.</p></div>
