        <h1>Chapter 1232</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick said with a grin, "No, no. But you didn't tell me you were hurt and I had to learn about it from someone else. What's the matter? Are you afraid that I'll come and get in the way of you getting close to her? You must&rsquo;ve won her heart by saving her life this time, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian lowered his eyes slightly, and he had a flashback of the thin figure that rushed out to stop his car as it left the mansion that morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She was so pale and haggard, but she held on just to see me! However, she only wanted to see me for Chase Harper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I would die for her, but she seems willing to risk her life for Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She can trust Chase Harper without any evidence in his favor, relying on just his words. What's so good about Chase Harper that she'll trust him so deeply?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian once again felt reluctant and jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would let her know that Chase Harper deserved it and that she should never trust him at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? That look on your face... Don't tell me Grace hasn't fallen for you yet? Is it possible that she's still in love with Jason?" said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face immediately darkened at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick knew he had misspoken and quickly laughed dryly. "Haha, it's just a joke. Jason and Grace have already broken up. Jason was also indifferent to Grace when we were at Tianxiang Pavilion's private room last time. He's probably not interested in Grace anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick had just finished speaking when a WeChat special alert notification rang on his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only set up special alerts for a few fair-weather friends he kept in touch with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He picked up the phone and casually glanced at the message he received. However, his eyes widened after seeing the contents of the message. He was full of disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian, who was sitting next to Patrick, said doubtfully, "What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Exactly!' Patrick really felt as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially... when Brian was right in front of him and they had just talked about... Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick felt that the message he saw was like a slap in the face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No-Nothing..." Patrick said guiltily, wanting to put the phone away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his behavior aroused Brian's suspicions. Patrick obviously did not want him to know what he saw just now. In other words, was the message that Patrick saw on his phone about him? Were the contents of the message about something he cared about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did you just see?" Brian asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing, really." Facing Brian's inquisitive phoenix eyes, Patrick felt even more guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's thin lips parted as he said, "It's alright if you don't want to tell me, but do you think I can't find out for myself? Of course, if you tell me that what you just saw has absolutely nothing to do with me, then I don't have to go look it up."</p></div>
