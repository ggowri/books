        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had only done what she had done to him. She was so ruthless to him that day at the hospital, and he was only doing the same to her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her hand to where her heart was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was he in such pain that day? It hurts so bad that I can hardly breathe!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? Kyla has gone to L City?" In Emerald City, Grace was at the store and learned from Mrs. Corbyn that Kyla had gone to L City by herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, she said she wants to meet Martin Weiss in person and talk about Jacqueline Bowman," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Kyla is pregnant and alone over there..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's a man named Mallory Malcom. He&rsquo;s Martin Weiss's personal secretary. He helped Kyla with food and accommodation. She can also ask him for help if there's anything else she needs. He said Martin Weiss has ordered him to do so." Mrs. Corbyn explained what she had learned from her daughter yesterday while on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace breathed a sigh of relief, but she called Kyla anyway on her way home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, why did you go to L City to see Martin Weiss without saying a word? You're pregnant. You have to be careful when you're there," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla replied, "Got it, I'll be careful. You don't have to worry about me. I'm doing... fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you see Martin Weiss today?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other end of the phone was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Kyla, did something happen?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said with agony, "Yes, I saw him, but... Martin Weiss refuses to give Jacqueline Bowman probation. I... I plan to stay in L City for a few more days and persuade Martin Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, we can give the matter further thought and find a way to give Jacqueline Bowman the punishment she deserves while finding out where your friend is!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Grace, I don't want to delay things any longer. I want to solve this problem as soon as possible. Finding out Amber Mitchell's whereabouts even one day earlier will save Amber Mitchell a day of suffering. Getting Martin Weiss to agree is the quickest solution now," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you would&rsquo;ve done the same thing if Lina was in a situation like this, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent for a moment before saying, "Kyla, if you ever run into any trouble there, call me. I have a few lawyer friends in L City who can help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sighed bitterly after ending the phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After meeting Martin Weiss today, she felt more and more unconfident. Martin Weiss's attitude toward her was so frigid. 'Even if I stay for a few more days and find a chance to meet Martin Weiss again, can I make him agree?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or is it just a fool's errand?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But Amber Mitchell... What kind of life is Amber Mitchell living now? How much is she suffering?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She dared not overthink. All she could do was beg Martin Weiss. Whatever it took, she would beg him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla went to Weiss Residence the next morning. However, it was no surprise that she could not enter. All she could do was wait outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at the time. It was now past seven o'clock. Weiss Group started work at nine o'clock. She had read the news before, and there was an interview where Martin Weiss mentioned he followed the company's working hours. That meant he would be out by 8:30 p.m. at the latest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That meant she had to wait here for about an hour.</p></div>
