        <h1>Chapter 3868</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it was before, if you wanted to seek revenge on me, I would have accepted it. You could have done whatever you wanted, but now, I won't allow it. Lawrence, I don't owe you anything anymore," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence grabbed Jasper's shoulder, "Whether you owe me or not, it's not up to you to decide with just one sentence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper winced in pain, "Since you won't give up your revenge, the next time you enter Emerald City, we'll be enemies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enemies?" Lawrence chuckled mockingly, "Since we can't be friends, being enemies isn't so bad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he couldn't have her love, then he could have her hatred, which was good enough for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least she still had some kind of feeling for him, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So Jasper, remember this, in the future, we'll be enemies!" Lawrence said, leaning in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he was about to kiss her, Jasper suddenly turned her head away, "No, you should know that the person I love isn't you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's eyes darkened, his face getting closer to hers, "It's William, isn't it? Do you really think you love him? Maybe your feelings for him are just a habit that's been built up over the years, to the point where you're deluded into thinking you love him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not a delusion," Jasper said seriously, "The person I love is William, I'm very clear about that. Some feelings may be love at first sight, but for some people, feelings are accumulated over the years. Lawrence, you're not me, so how can you judge what my feelings for William are like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's face turned ugly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let go of me," Jasper said, "Or is kissing someone who doesn't love you your way of seeking revenge?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence looked at Jasper and suddenly lowered his head again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!" Jasper resisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the next moment, she froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence was indeed "kissing" her, but he placed his own palm between his and her lips. He was kissing his own hand, and his palm was tightly pressed against her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was his kiss to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't want to force her anymore, but he wanted her to remember him, so he made this choice in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stiffened all over, staring at Lawrence who was so close, her body seemed to be frozen, making it difficult for her to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know how long it had passed, but he finally ended this special "kiss" and slowly straightened up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the hand blocking her lips finally slowly moved away from her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, don't forget me, even if it's hate, don't forget me!" This was his last words to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper still stood there in a daze until Lawrence left the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was their farewell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought that by doing this, she could completely resolve her own emotional entanglements and let go of Lawrence completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why does she now have a feeling that it can't be completely cut off?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like even though he's leaving Emerald City, maybe years later, he will appear in front of her again, and then it will stir up some kind of storm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A vague sense of unease lingered in her chest.</p></div>
