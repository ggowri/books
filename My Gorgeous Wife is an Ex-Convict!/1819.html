        <h1>Chapter 1817</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, did you go through my drawer?" shouted Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney glared at her daughter. "I was looking for nail clippers. Who knew I would find this? I thought you were taking some slimming pills, but after I took it to the pharmacy and asked, it turns out it&rsquo;s something women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant take!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina bit her lip and immediately dared not speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, what... What is a lady like you eating this for? Are you... You..." Mrs. Sweeney seemed a little embarrassed to go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney shouted right away, "Tell us the truth. Are you pregnant with this Stephenson boy's child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney started recalling some things like how his daughter had been throwing up recently; how she had decided to stop meeting Anthony Sherman and just be friends with him; how Hadwin Stephenson sent her home today; and the bunch of deliveries sent to this house. He started thinking that it was possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was so impressed she almost kneeled in front of her father. He figured out everything with only one bottle of folic acid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Needless to say, Mr. Sweeney knew he was right at the sight of his daughter's expression. He instantly got up and raised his fist to punch Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney was almost 60 years old, so he was not a good fighter. However, Hadwin Stephenson did not dodge him and just stood there, letting Mr. Sweeney beat him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You broke up with Lina when she was seriously injured, and now you&rsquo;ve taken advantage of her. Haven't you hurt her enough?" Mr. Sweeney punched Hadwin Stephenson again and again. Soon, he was out of breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson just stood there motionless and accepted the punches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina and Mrs. Sweeney hurriedly grabbed Mr. Sweeney. "What's the use of you beating him? It's useless now!" said Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The boy is too awful. I must beat him up! The daughter of the Sweeney family can't be taken advantage of that easily. Good for him, huh? He can just walk away after he's done. What about Lina? How is Lina going to go on with her life?" Mr. Sweeney snapped as his fist hit Hadwin Stephenson again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said nothing and did not defend himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Dad, Hadwin Stephenson didn't take advantage of me. It's not what you think!" Lina quickly shouted when she saw that the corners of Hadwin Stephenson's lips had started bleeding. She was afraid Hadwin Stephenson would be admitted to the hospital due to her father's beating if he went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He didn't take advantage of you?" Mr. Sweeney stopped what he was doing and turned to glare at his daughter. "In that case, you were willing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well... Not really..." Lina said with a look of embarrassment, "It's just that... I... I drank too much that night and called Hadwin Stephenson by mistake. Then I accidentally..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina spoke with extreme difficulty. It felt like she had gone back to her elementary school days when she had to face her parents at home after being scolded by her teacher for skipping school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Halfway through the explanation, she looked timidly at her parents. "Well... do I need to be more specific?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Enough, enough. No thanks..." Mr. Sweeney said hurriedly. The old married couple looked embarrassed as well. They did not expect their daughter to be the one who forced herself on the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Speaking of which, Hadwin Stephenson seemed to be the victim here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was probably the one feeling the least awkward in the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How... How could you do such a thing? You can't do that even if you're drunk!" Mr. Sweeney could only vent his anger at his daughter now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina nodded and humbly admitted her mistake. "I won't do it again. I promise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Again? Do you want to do it again?" Mr. Sweeney rolled his eyes angrily. "Now that you're pregnant, what are you going to do about the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, the baby in his daughter's belly was the biggest problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll take responsibility," Hadwin Stephenson said directly.</p></div>
