        <h1>Chapter 2022</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina planned to shop in the shopping mall here with Grace. She wanted to buy some baby products and have Grace give her some advice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "Hadwin Stephenson didn't prepare anything for you?" In her opinion, Hadwin Stephenson could not wait to arm Lina to the teeth. He prepared everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He has prepared everything, but I want to buy something for myself too. Because if Daddy does all the shopping and Mommy doesn't, how am I a mommy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not help laughing. Looking at the joy on her best friend's face, she was happy for Lina. It was great that Lina and Hadwin Stephenson's hard times were over. Their good times were about to begin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just as they approached the mall, Lina dragged Grace to the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Aren't we going to the mall?" Grace asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just want to check something out. I heard they&rsquo;re filming Old Friends 2 here today," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Friends was a gay drama broadcasted on online platforms. The two male leads were rookies, but the response had been good so far. Grace's best friend had recommended the drama, and she watched it every week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she had no idea that her best friend even knew that they were filming the sequel nearby today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How do you know about it?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina felt a little embarrassed as soon as she asked that. She asked a little awkwardly, "Uh... I&rsquo;m pregnant now, so Hadwin assigned a few people to me. I can get them to do whatever I need. Old Friends is shooting their sequel now, so I asked them to look up where they&rsquo;re filming. I can't believe they&rsquo;re so efficient. They even got me the filming schedule."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was speechless. "Does Hadwin Stephenson know you asked his men to do this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was meek. "Probably... not." If Hadwin found out, she would not have gotten the schedule at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two of them got to the neighborhood. Sure enough, a film crew was filming there. However, not many fans knew they were filming here, so there were not too many people around. Some staff members were clearing the scene to avoid too many onlookers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina saw two male lead actors coming out of a cafe, her eyes immediately lit up. "Hey, it's true that they're filming here!" She was so lucky to see the two male leads as soon as she came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace followed her best friend's gaze and saw the two male lead actors. Speaking of which, though the two men were rookies, they were pretty good at acting. Besides, the first drama was rather simple, and their vague relationship was enthralling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Speaking of which, did your man say anything when you watched the show?" Lina asked with some curiosity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I watched it during the day when he wasn&rsquo;t home," said Grace. It would be a little weird to watch a drama like that with Jay. "What about you? Did you watch it with Hadwin Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ha..." Lina chuckled drily. "I'm binge-watching the drama. I want to know everything that&rsquo;s happening. I can't wait until daytime to watch it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Didn&rsquo;t Hadwin Stephenson say anything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He said nothing. He only looked a little serious. I&rsquo;m just admiring them anyway. I don't have any other ideas," mumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could not help recalling how Hadwin Stephenson had grabbed her jaw and his lips were against her earlobes when she watched the drama last night. "Do you enjoy watching this so much? Why don't I star in a film like that someday? Will you look at me so intently then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina could not help blushing at the thought of it.</p></div>
