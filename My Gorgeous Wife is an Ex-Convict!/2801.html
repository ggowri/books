        <h1>Chapter 2799</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he walked out of the room, leaving Kyla alone in the cramped living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I moving in with Martin Weiss... tomorrow? Is this... the last time we're spending together?' Kyla could not help smiling bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller found herself unable to stop looking at Brian&rsquo;s lips when she and Brian were together. For example, when she worked overtime in the studio to draw some storyboards, Brian would sit on the couch nearby, reading the comic books she kept in the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as she drew, she could not help glancing at him from the corners of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not for the storyboards she had to finish today, she would have been tempted to pick up her pencil and draw him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he read the comic book quietly was as beautiful as a portrait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His sculpted face, sharp brows, phoenix eyes, and straight nose bridge looked beautiful when viewed from the side. What caught her eye the most was his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips were defined, thin, and sexy. They had a touch of pink, which was beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips felt so soft... It was a pity that the last time he kissed her, it had ended a little too soon...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you, you can just look at me if you want." His voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face indifferently turned red as her eyes met those dark phoenix eyes. She was considered to have been caught peeking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, I just think you look good," Valda Theller said with slight embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I seem to be your type," he quipped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What were you thinking when you were looking at me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought our last kiss ended a little too soon..." she blurted out. She only realized what she had said after a few seconds. Her face instantly felt like it was on fire as she waved her hands quickly. She said, "I... I'm joking. Don't take it seriously!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she looked down to stop looking at the face that could induce people's imagination easily. She tried to refocus on the storyboard she was working on but failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, his voice suddenly rang above her head. "Did you want the kiss to last longer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller instantly looked up to see Brian had walked over to her at some point. He was slightly bent over as he asked her the question. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she looked up, his face was magnified in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gulp!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller heard herself gulping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Come on, doesn't he know it's easy to go off into wild flights of fantasy when he asks such a question with that face of his?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm?" He hummed as if waiting for her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared blankly at his face and suddenly said as if she had made up her mind, "Yes, I wish we could&rsquo;ve kissed longer. I also wish I could kiss you again. I... I like you, so I... I would think that way..."</p></div>
