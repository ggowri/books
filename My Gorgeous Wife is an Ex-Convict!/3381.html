        <h1>Chapter 3379</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this silence also makes people's hearts become afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you feel scared?" A young and immature voice suddenly spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not afraid," said Lornell. In fact, he had faced death several times since he could remember.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some of them are even closer to death than they are now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My father once said that since he is a child of the Quentin family, it is inevitable to face such trials, so there is nothing to be afraid of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because regardless of fear, one must go through the experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I'm afraid," the little one said honestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you afraid your parents won't come to save you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not true!" She immediately retorted, "My mommy and daddy will definitely come to rescue us. They promised that I am their most precious treasure, and if I am ever in danger, they will come find me no matter where they are!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the surroundings were dim at the moment, he couldn't see her expression clearly, but in his mind, he pictured her looking sulky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you afraid of?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've been like this, feeling uncomfortable and unable to move... I'm just really scared," she said, unable to describe exactly what she was afraid of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In reality, she was afraid of the unknown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you tell me a story? Will you tell me a story?" the little one asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know how," Lornell refused directly. He wasn't one to enjoy listening to stories, let alone telling them to others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well... can I tell you one instead?" the little one asked as a compromise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't talk too much. Before long, you'll get very thirsty and we don't have any water to drink right now," Lornell reminded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one obediently closed their mouth, but hummed a nursery rhyme softly through their nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The intermittent humming seemed to dispel the suffocating silence of the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passed, and Lornell felt the little one's humming getting softer and softer until it finally stopped. The little one didn't speak, but lay quietly on his chest, as if... dead, motionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, he didn't feel scared, but at this moment, he suddenly became afraid, afraid that this little one might really die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, you..." He hesitated for a moment, and her name just blurted out... "Harley... Harley, what's wrong with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, her voice finally came intermittently, "I... am so sleepy, want to sleep... Don't be afraid, I... we are together, I'm afraid my parents... will come to save us..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she groped around and finally found his hand, and then grabbed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell was startled, feeling her soft little hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could shake off her hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at this moment, he didn't want to shake it off. It was as if being held by her like this could give him a sense of security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Will they definitely come to save them?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does she really trust her parents?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought of that night again, when she rushed up angrily and demanded an apology from the others because they had said bad things about her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite being small in size, it shows no signs of fear. Its clear black and white eyes are both pure and determined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, she fearlessly grabbed him and asked for his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If we can really stay alive, then I can tell you my name," he slowly spoke these words from his mouth.</p></div>
