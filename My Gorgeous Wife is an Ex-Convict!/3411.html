        <h1>Chapter 3409</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback and finally got a good look at the boy in front of her. He was tall and had a cheerful face. Judging from his school uniform, he was probably a year older than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, senior. I'll just go home and apply some red flower oil myself," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go to the medical room to have a look. It will put my mind at ease. Otherwise, if this small injury turns into a big one later on, it won't be good." The other person insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hesitated for a moment, but the other person took her hand without hesitation and led her towards the medical room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" Veronica was taken aback and for a moment, she couldn't quite regain her composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, she followed the other person to the medical room, and the doctor there drew the curtain and examined the injury on her shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And that boy stood outside waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, just a little bruising. Your bones are fine. Just go back and apply some medicine," said the doctor. "Do you want me to prescribe some medicine for you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I have some bruise medicine at home," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy breathed a sigh of relief, "Luckily, there's no bone injury. I was worried about it all along."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You boys, when playing ball, also need to pay attention to your surroundings," said the school doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, yes, I will definitely pay more attention next time," the boy replied repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, Veronica and the boy walked out of the infirmary. The boy took the initiative and said, "By the way, my name is Daniel Cross from Class 23 of the second year. What's your name and which class are you in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." She hesitated for a moment, then said, "I'm Veronica from Class 2-1."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel paused for a moment, "You're Veronica? I've heard of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's body tensed up. Usually, when she hears something like this, it's not good news. She's well aware of the rumors about her that circulate around school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this thought, Veronica couldn't help but feel a sinking feeling in her heart and a hint of embarrassment on her face. She was about to leave in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" Daniel quickly asked, "What's wrong? Did I say something wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, just that since I've already been to the infirmary and I'm fine, I want to go back to the classroom first," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have WhatsApp? Let's add each other on WhatsApp. We accidentally injured you while playing ball today. If you need any help in the future, I will definitely help you," the other person said, taking out their phone and seeming to want to exchange WhatsApp information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it's okay. I... I don't think we need to exchange WhatsApp. Thank you for bringing me to the clinic, senior. That's it," Veronica said, lifting her foot and leaving in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel stared at Veronica's back as if he was lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica returned to the classroom, most of her classmates had already packed up and gone home, but Mason was sitting in his seat waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His sitting posture is very upright, so much so that one could even use the word "standard" to describe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, being too "perfect" can give off an impression of being less human. It's like how he always felt out of place in school, unable to blend in with the group like everyone else. He seemed to live in his own world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If anyone could truly enter his world, it would be her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Mason, who had been sitting in his seat, seemed to sense something and looked up in Veronica's direction.</p></div>
