        <h1>Chapter 1196</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tears kept pouring out of Stella's eyes as she spoke. She was not entirely faking her tears. After all, she was scared. If Brian believed Grace&rsquo;s words, then she was doomed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Brian did not believe Grace after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had been looking at Brian the whole time. "In your eyes, am I the kind of person who would lie and pretend to be someone to save another person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice was less aggressive than before. It was as if she was only asking a serious but simple question, but his heart suddenly began to panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was he panicking about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the distance between him and her that he had managed to pull shorter seemed to be growing further and further away. All this was because of Chase Harper, a man he had never cared much about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his impression, the man was just an average-looking ordinary person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Chase Harper really that important to you?" he asked without answering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want him to be wronged groundlessly," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll know if it's groundless in court. Since you think he was wronged, why not see what the judge says?" Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you won't let him go, will you?" said Grace as she pressed her dry lips together. She suddenly found the man in front of her unfamiliar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could be so gentle yet so cold. Lina once said people online commented that he was affectionate but also merciless. When he was truly merciless, he was the most ruthless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... had forgotten that he was the crown prince of the entertainment industry and only regarded him as Bryn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she heard him say in a cold voice, "It's not whether I'm willing to let him go, but that he has done something wrong and must be punished by the law."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, she felt as though her heart was steadily sinking...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace left the ward, leaving only Brian and Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella spoke while she wiped her tears with a tissue, "Brian, don't... Don't blame Grace. I want to bring Chase Harper to justice, but I don't want you two to make such a fuss about my incident. I can drop the charge. I can endure this grievance for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the show Stella put on did not attract the least sympathy from Brian. Those phoenix eyes just stared at her coldly. "Did Chase Harper really mean to harm you that day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's eyes widened suddenly as if she had been wronged. "I wouldn't joke about such a thing no matter what! Even though I've been married before, it doesn't mean I'm a shameless woman. Brian, how can you doubt me like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no matter how aggrieved Stella seemed to look, Brian still looked at her coldly as if he wanted to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A little creeped out by the way she was being looked at, Stella said, "Why... Why are you looking at me like that?"</p></div>
