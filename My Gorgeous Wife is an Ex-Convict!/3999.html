        <h1>Chapter 3997</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Grandma has been feeling guilty all these years. If she hadn't abandoned Grandpa like that, it would have been so much better. Dad still hasn't forgiven Grandma. Although her memory isn't as good as before, she still remembers a lot of things about Grandpa. Every time I visit her, she talks to me about Grandpa. She says she can't make up for her guilt towards him in her lifetime, and can only take it to the grave, hoping to meet Grandpa again in the next life to make up for it." Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the use of making up for it in the next life? We don't even know if there is a next life." Mick sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Nancy's words to him under the wishing tree came to his mind--</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If one day you need me, even if it means going through fire and water, I will repay you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what was the point of her going through fire and water for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need it at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So in life, we should try to avoid doing things that we will regret later." Jasper said. "That's the only way to live a carefree life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she turned to her older brother. "Big brother, do you have anything you regret?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's eyes darkened. "No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was slightly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's late. Let's go back to sleep." Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." Jasper replied, and the two of them left the ancestral hall together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But on the way back, Jasper glanced at the person beside her from the corner of her eye, surprised that her brother didn't say anything about regretting meeting Nancy or anything like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even if Nancy used him, he doesn't regret meeting her or giving her his affection?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of feelings does he have for Nancy now? Can he really let go of his feelings for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People always say that the Reed family is loyal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this loyalty only leads to happiness if it's placed on the right person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it's placed on the wrong person, it can lead to disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of their loyalty, even if they're betrayed or hurt, it's hard for them to love someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Grandpa is like this, then what about Big Brother...?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What will happen to him in the future?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jasper is filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene watched as the head of HR in front of her opened and closed his mouth, saying the same thing over and over again: the hotel was planning to fire her and she wouldn't even receive compensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because of her actions that damaged the hotel, and the hotel would demand compensation for their losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of HR even said, "All the alcohol in the private room that day, including the bottles, have been sent for testing. If they find any other substances, the police will come after you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene's face turned pale and by the time she left the HR office, her palms were covered in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, when Mick's bodyguard took her out of the private room, the drugs in her system caused her to do many unsightly things in front of many of her colleagues, even taking off her clothes and saying things she shouldn't have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for her colleagues locking her in a temporary room, the hotel would probably have made headlines!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she hid at home for two days afterwards, when she returned to the hotel, many colleagues were pointing and whispering behind her back. Some even showed disdain directly in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was nothing compared to what would happen if the police got involved. Would her life... end up like her mother's?</span></p></div>
