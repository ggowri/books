        <h1>Chapter 2847</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time he had been kissed while blindfolded. He could not see, but his other senses became sharper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her scent, warmth, and nasally voice became very clear to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not help being absorbed in the kiss. Valda Theller's hand tugged off his tie and caressed his eyes when it was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you have such beautiful eyes. They're so beautiful! Do you know... I... I was drawn to them the first time I saw them on that rainy day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Drawn?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, drawn. I just thought... your eyes looked like they were going to cry. I... I didn&rsquo;t want to see you cry. Such beautiful... eyes shouldn't be crying..." she said as she kissed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He shuddered. The woman had said not long ago that she would never make such intimate gestures unless he had fallen for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was so intimate with him after getting drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of rejecting her, he was... expectant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Expectant... What am I expecting? Am I expecting her to be more intimate with me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not going to cry," he murmured. He had no reason to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"R-Really?" she muttered as her fingers began to play with his eyelashes. &ldquo;Then you... you're not allowed... not allowed to cry from now on. You're a puppy if... if you do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was torn between tears and laughter by her remark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, you're drunk. Go back to bed and sleep first." He gestured for her to get up, but her arms wrapped around his neck while her head leaned on his shoulder. She mumbled, "I'll... treasure you very much. I'll treasure you more than anyone else... so... don't cry... I won't leave you. I won't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice grew quieter and quieter until it finally faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was in a trance for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does this woman want to treasure me more than anyone else? Does she love me that much?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long while, he carried the woman who had fallen asleep back to bed and carefully covered her with a thin blanket. "If you won't leave me, let me fall in love with you first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, did I do anything to you last night other than cover your eyes with a tie?" Valda Theller turned her head suddenly and asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled faintly. "No, you didn't do anything else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was a little reserved at the beginning of dinner, but she loosened up afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, Brian had seen her at her worst anyway, so she had nothing to be ashamed of. It was pointless being embarrassed about what had happened anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, are you sure you don't want to take back the gown and jewelry from yesterday?" Valda Theller asked.</p></div>
