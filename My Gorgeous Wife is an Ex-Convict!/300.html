        <h1>Chapter 299</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he seemed to turn a deaf ear to her words. He just stared at her and said, "Are you going to hurt me, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body shuddered as she felt her throat tighten as if some words were stuck in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were fixed on her as if he was going to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that a difficult question?" After a long silence, he muttered, "It's all right if you don't want to answer, but let me remind you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He bent slowly while his lips got close to her ear. He whispered, "Never hurt me, all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she did not hurt him, he would praise her to the heavens, love her to the earth, and even protect her, making sure she was happy and safe for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she did not hurt him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the huge room, Grace fidgeted, occasionally checking the clock on her phone and calculating how long it would be before she heard any news about her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, on the other hand, had changed into a set of casual clothes and was sitting on the sofa, leafing through some professional reports.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the elegantly seated Jason, Grace could not help but think of the words he had said earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said that she must never hurt him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The problem was, she could not hurt him at all! What he said was a little redundant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who in Emerald City could hurt a man like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if taking notice of her gaze, he looked up at her. "Are you thinking of me? Or Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she was thinking of Lina. She just had an occasional flash of thought about what he had said before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, looking at her now, she had a feeling that she could not tell the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he looked so gentle now that he seemed harmless, if she offended him, then...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a little afraid to go on. She must not offend him because she was still counting on him to help her find Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Jason's phone suddenly rang. The ringing of the phone was particularly clear in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes immediately fell on the phone Jason had left on the coffee table. It was already 11 p.m. It was already so late at night. Could the caller be the person Jason ordered to help investigate Lina&rsquo;s whereabouts?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glanced at the caller ID on his phone, answered the call, glanced at Grace's eager expression, and turned on the speaker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man's voice sounded from the phone. "We've found her, Young Master Reed. Lina was taken away by Hadwin Stephenson. She should be at Hadwin Stephenson's house in Crescent Bay now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned slightly. "Hadwin Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, there&rsquo;s no mistake. Hadwin Stephenson himself captured her today," the man said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I see." Jason ended the call, looked up at Grace, and said, "When did Lina get involved with Hadwin Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked confused. "Hadwin Stephenson? Who is he?"</p></div>
