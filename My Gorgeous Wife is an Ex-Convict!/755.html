        <h1>Chapter 754</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly chuckled. "Sis, did you really save Brian when you were little?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay glared at her. "Would Brian be so nice to me if I hadn't saved him when I was little?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't think you liked going to the hill when you were little, right? I was the one who always went there for fun," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's face paled. "What... Do you mean by that? What does saving Brian have to do with whether I liked going there or not? Anyway, I happened to save Brian on an occasional trip."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Happened to?" Grace looked at the shifty look in her eyes and was already sure that her cousin was guilty, so she evaded her like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It must not have been Stella who saved Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, have you had enough?" Stella Lindsay said angrily as she was embarrassed. She deliberately used anger to cover up her guilt. "It's not up to you to meddle in this matter between me and Brian. Just mind your own business!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Stella Lindsay stormed off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her eyes gently and looked at her hands. 'If the dream is all about me saving Brian when I was little&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Then these hands were there on the cliff, holding Brian by the hand tightly and dragging him back to safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'These same hands carried him on my back and led him down from the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Therefore... The silver bracelet Brian has been holding on to is also the silver bracelet I wore when I was a child?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered having a pair of such silver bracelets when she was a child, but she dropped one of them. Later, when she was older and could not wear the little bracelet anymore, Grandma put it away for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... I didn&rsquo;t see any similar little bracelets among the things Grandma left me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grandma probably lost it. After all, it was so many years ago, and such a small silver bracelet was not worth much money.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked to the door of the Lu family's house and looked at the place where she used to live as a child. She thought she would not set foot in here again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she had to visit Grandma's grave on the annual tomb-sweeping day and winter solstice, she would only go directly to Grandma's grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver, who sent her here, had been waiting outside the door. When he saw Grace coming out, he asked where she was going.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Send me to Grandma's grave later," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver responded. Just then, Grace saw Stella Lindsay holding Brian's arm and stepping out from inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Stella Lindsay saw Grace, a flash of worry came over her face, as if fearing that Grace would say something to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, come on. I'll take you to eat the candied haws on a stick here. The one I told you that I'd take you to eat when we were little." Stella Lindsay deliberately raised her volume, apparently in an attempt to get Grace to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Brian as he nodded and walked right past Grace without even looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her eyes and watched as the two got into the car which then slowly drove away from the Lu family's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When they were little?' Grace's eyes dimmed slightly. 'I think I'm the one who said I'd take Brian to eat candied haws on a stick when we were little.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, her favorite food at the time was candied haws on a stick, and that particular store was still open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I wonder if Stella Lindsay is taking Brian there or not.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened the door and got into the car. She gave the exact location of Grandma's burial place, and the driver in front drove off to their destination.</p></div>
