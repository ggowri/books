        <h1>Chapter 2509</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression changed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She twisted her wrist to free her hand from his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his fingers gripped her so tightly that she could not get them off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you say you wouldn&rsquo;t bother wasting your effort? Why are you reacting like this now?&rdquo; he asked derisively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because it's unbearable." She gave him her answer. "I find it unbearable when you hold me like this." It was as if every cell in her body was screaming for him to leave and were disgusted by him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned and grabbed her hand a little tighter. "Then keep putting up with it. It's no use struggling if I don't want to let go of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only felt spasms of pain from being gripped by him, but she was stubborn and unwilling to cry out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned to look out the car window. The streets of Deer City were still bright and dazzling at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With George Gregory holding her hand so tightly, one would have thought they were being intimate. Only she knew how much strength she needed to control the trembling and suppress her nausea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car finally stopped, she found that George Gregory had taken her to the entrance of the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver in the front got out, leaving Amber Mitchell and George Gregory alone in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked at the entrance of the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house. The entrance of the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house used to be crowded with reporters. However, the reporters gradually decreased over time and finally disappeared after the three members of the Mitchell family were detained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The entrance of the Mitchell family house was deserted, and the mansion was dark as far as the eye could see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haven&rsquo;t you always wanted the Mitchell family? As long as you let Louise Mitchell go, I can make Louise Mitchell return the shares that belong to you. Even if you ask for Louise Mitchell's fingers, I won't stop you. I can even make the Mitchell family transfer the Mitchell family's old residence to you. You have nothing to lose!" George Gregory said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell finally understood George Gregory's intention. It was already the second time he asked her to spare Louise Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought I told you that there's no way I'll spare her. I won't spare anyone who ruined me and put me in the mental hospital!" She refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's your sister. Besides, you want control of the Mitchell family, don&rsquo;t you? I can give it to you now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell suddenly laughed. "You're giving it to me? You sound like a robber who took everything from the victim and is now telling the victim that you can give them back some of their belongings. You speak as though you&rsquo;re bestowing the greatest gift, but it was the victim&rsquo;s in the first place. Why should I accept your offer to give me my things back as though you&rsquo;re doing me a favor?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She questioned, and his expression grew more ghastly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does that mean you don&rsquo;t want to spare Louise Mitchell?" he asked grimly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she answered without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, are you going to make me an enemy once and for all?" His eyes looked at her coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You and I have long been enemies." They were already enemies when he looked on as Louise Mitchell took her shares, when he watched from the sidelines as the Mitchell family put her in the mental hospital, and when did nothing while she was suffering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't regret it, Amber Mitchell," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled again and looked at him with cold eyes. "George Gregory, what I regret most in my life is being with you and believing in your nonsense."</p></div>
