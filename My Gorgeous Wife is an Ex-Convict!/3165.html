        <h1>Chapter 3163</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... no matter what happens, even if one day we have another argument or... I have to leave you again, you won't let me go, right?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked puzzled. "Why do you think you would leave me again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He slowly uttered two words, "hypnosis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback, then realized what he meant. "You mean, if one day your hypnosis wears off, you will leave me? But... you left me because you hypnotized yourself to forget your feelings for me. If the hypnosis wears off..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it wears off, normally I should be more willing to be with you, right?" he interjected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She nodded hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, normally that's how it should be. But... there's always a chance. After all, it was because the love was too painful, too humble, and even... hopeless, that I chose hypnosis," Martin said. "But at that time, I probably didn't expect that even if I hypnotized those feelings away, I would fall in love with you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Falling in love with her was like destiny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if he could use hypnosis to forget those feelings, he couldn't help but be attracted to her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin took out the carefully folded piece of paper and handed it to Kyla. "This paper has the code to release me from hypnosis. Only when you say this code in front of me will it work, because when I set the condition to release the hypnosis, you were the one who had to say this sentence in front of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla instinctively wanted to open the piece of paper, but Martin stopped her and said, "Listen to me first. I'll tell you the secret code, and then you can decide whether or not to release me from hypnosis. If you want me to regain my past feelings, then say the secret code in front of me. But if you don't want me to recover, then remember the code and never say that sentence in front of me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla suddenly felt that the paper in her hand was heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did he just give her the power to choose? Allowing her to decide his emotions!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you don't need to tell me your decision. Just remember what's written on this paper and take your time to think it through before deciding," said Martin. "But I hope that no matter what happens in the future, you won't give up on me. Promise me that we'll always be together, no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla's eyes became moist. Was this man afraid that one day he would break the hypnosis and leave her again because of the painful emotions from the past?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I promise you that no matter what happens in the future, I won't give up on you. And if one day you want to leave, I will definitely try to keep you." Kyla replied in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin smiled and said, "Kyla, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lowered his head and kissed her lips uncontrollably, thanking her and willing to make such a promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Between them, there have been too many hurts, but even so, she is still willing to continue being with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla tilted her chin up and responded to the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The barrier that once stood between them seems to be slowly disappearing, and their future is sure to become better and better...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Valda woke up, it was already past 12 o'clock. Brian had already gone to work, but before leaving in the morning, he instructed the servant to prepare a hangover soup for her, so that she wouldn't have a headache due to drinking too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is drinking a hangover soup, trying hard to recall what happened last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yesterday she had some drinks and got a little tipsy, but she didn't get too drunk.</p></div>
