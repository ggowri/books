        <h1>Chapter 1943</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was crying. She was standing on the side of the road with one hand wiping away the tears from her face while the other was clutching a phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly shouted, "Stop!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The driver hurriedly pulled over at the roadside. Hadwin Stephenson quickly got out of the car and came up to Lina. "What are you doing here? Why..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His voice suddenly stopped because she looked up at him with red eyes. Her teary eyes instantly pricked his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Boo-hoo!" Lina suddenly raised her hand and beat Hadwin Stephenson's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson frowned and grabbed her hand. "What's wrong with you? What on earth happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina sobbed. "They're gone. The photos... are gone. They're gone... Those phone technicians said the photos have been completely erased! Do you know how important those photos are to me? How could you delete them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson frowned deeper as he said coldly, "I told you. Those are photos of me. It's up to me how I want to deal with them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But those are my memories! I took those photos. They&rsquo;re... They&rsquo;re memories of me and the man I love the most! Even if you don't love me anymore, couldn&rsquo;t you leave me those memories?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina cried loudly and shouted as if to vent the pain suppressed in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She visited several phone repair workshops throughout the afternoon, only to be told that the deleted photos could not be recovered. In other words, they were gone forever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stiffened. 'Is she crying so much because of those photos? Do those photos of me really mean that much to her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, Lina's crying paused as she grunted in pain. There was a pained look on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson froze. "What's come over you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said with a gasp, "My... My stomach... hurts a little... The baby... Is there something wrong with the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her brows furrowed deeper and deeper as her face also grew paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson instantly carried Lina in his arms. "I'll send you to the hospital immediately!" With that said, he hurried toward the car parked at the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the way to the hospital, Lina's hands were pressed on her slightly swollen abdomen, her face full of anxiety. "Baby, nothing must happen to you. Stay in my belly until it's time for you to come out, okay? I beg you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her fragile and choked voice put Hadwin Stephenson in a trance. The look on her face and the tone of her voice made it seem like the baby meant a lot to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The baby will be alright," said Hadwin Stephenson. He just blurted it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really? Will they be alright?" Lina turned her head to look at him. She was just like a drowning man clutching to a floating board.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I, Hadwin Stephenson, will be able to keep the baby if I want to keep them! I won't let anything happen to the baby!" he said even though he had told himself not to care about the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when he saw her anxiousness and thought about the possibility of losing the unborn baby, he felt an impulse to save them at all costs.</p></div>
