        <h1>Chapter 1548</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every day in the past five years, he regretted missing out on his chance with her. He might have had a chance, but he pushed her to Jason instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she had not been with Jason, would she have fallen into the sea?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When his car arrived at Reed Residence, he was stopped by the Reed family's security guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I want to see Grace!" said Brian after getting out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The guard recognized Brian. "Young Madam has gone out and hasn't come back yet. Mr. Hart, please make another appointment if you want to see Young Madam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian did not leave but waited at Reed Residence's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she did not come back, he would wait until she came back. Just waiting a few hours was nothing to him compared to the past five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Reed family's security guards did not know what to say. After all, he was the entertainment industry's crown prince and was not standing inside Reed Residence. They could not drive him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was holding her daughter's hand as they took the subway back to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Uncle Kwan had prepared a car for her when she went out today, but Grace chose to take the bus and subway. She wanted her daughter to have a good look at Emerald City. After all, it was tMason Swansonty where she and Jay grew up and fell in love. Her daughter would also grow up in this city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, can we play with Nelson again next time? We should bring Brother with us next time too!&rdquo; said Jasper Reed. She was fond of Nelson Corbyn after meeting him today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay. I'll take you and your brother to aunt Corbyn's house to play with Nelson next time." Grace laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Today, she had taken her daughter to see Kyla, who no longer had the energy to run a small restaurant like before after undergoing liver transplant surgery. Hence, she opened a store near a primary school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Business was okay. Since it was the primary school Nelson was studying in, it was convenient for Nelson to go to and from school and have meals at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She also saw Nelson today. Suddenly, the little one she remembered was already nine years old. The top of his head almost reached her chin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had grown out of his cute and childish appearance. He had become a handsome little boy who would probably attract a lot of girls when he grew up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At noon today, she saw a little girl who came to the store to buy something. She had confessed her feelings to Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help but sigh at the precocity of children nowadays. She seemed to know nothing about this when she was nine years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Nelson had calmly rejected the girl, saying, "I'm sorry. I don't like you." It was as if he had dealt with similar situations a lot of times before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little girl left while feeling disappointed. When Grace looked at the way Nelson had rejected her so calmly, Martin Weiss's face flickered in her mind. She had to admit, Nelson was looking more and more like Martin Weiss now, especially when he stood there calmly rejecting girls. Only his eyes were like Kyla's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Earlier when Nelson saw Grace, his eyes had suddenly turned red. He was shocked, happy, and excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy, who had just rejected a girl with a calm face, felt like he had gone back in time. He rushed into Grace's arms and shouted, "Aunt!&rdquo;</p></div>
