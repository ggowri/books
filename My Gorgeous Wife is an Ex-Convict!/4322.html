        <h1>Chapter 4320 Wanting to See Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't stop thinking about him. Every moment, every breath, his face was imprinted in my mind. I longed to see him, to be in his presence once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But fate seemed to be playing a cruel game with us. Our paths never seemed to cross, no matter how much I wished for it. It was as if the universe was conspiring to keep us apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I refused to give up. I would do whatever it takes to see him, even if it meant going against all odds. Because when I'm with him, everything else fades away. He is my world, my everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I will find a way to see him, no matter what. Our love will conquer all obstacles, and we will be together, forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!" Tina agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell left and after a while, he came back to her with a bottle of medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Colorless and tasteless liquid, you can pour it on his food or in his drinking water and beverages, just a few drops should do the trick," said Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina furrowed her brows as she looked at the bottle of medicine in her hand. No matter how she looked at it, there were at least 50 milliliters of liquid inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you giving me so much when all I need is a few drops?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Consider it a gift, after all, it's not like you can get pregnant in just one try," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"...Tina was speechless. Did he mean for her to use it multiple times?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When can I see Chandler again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone was guarding outside the room, so she couldn't just move around freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that will depend on your own abilities. If you get into any trouble, I'm sure Chandler will come to see you," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina raised an eyebrow. "Okay, then please tell Chandler that I fainted!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"...This time, the speechless one was Lornell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please help me out, otherwise I won't be able to have another child and you won't be able to research anything." Tina pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell reluctantly said, "Fine, I'll help you this once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks a lot!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to her surprise,, no matter if she fainted or went on a hunger strike, Chandler just didn't come to see her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was getting anxious. If things continued like this, she might not even get to see Chandler until the parasite was already out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, we can't keep waiting like this anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina opened the door and walked out without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guard at the entrance of the Quentin family stopped me and said, "Miss Stephenson, without the owner's orders, you cannot wander around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see Chandler. If you don't want me wandering around, just take me to where he is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry!" The other person said as they reached out to grab Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina seemed to have anticipated it and immediately pulled open her collar, shouting loudly, "Someone is violating me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the security guard's face turned red and he quickly pulled back his hand, saying, "I didn't do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina took advantage of the opportunity and quickly ran towards the other side. The two security guards immediately noticed and hurriedly chased after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked around for the most crowded place and ran towards it. After all, her ultimate goal was to make a scene and force Chandler to see her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Tina's body had only recently recovered, and her stamina was still weak. She hadn't even run for long before being stopped by a group of security personnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Stephenson is so amazing, causing such a commotion in the Quentin family!" A hoarse voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked up and saw an old man walking towards her. Behind him were a few people, including Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Tina had never met the head of the Quentin family, Lornell's grandfather, she could easily guess his identity from the way he carried himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see Chandler," Tina said, lifting her chin to hide any hint of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the daughter of the Stephenson family and also the wife of the Hunter family. She had enough status to have a conversation with the head of the Quentin family here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a valid reason for her request: "I am Chandler's wife, and a wife should be able to see her husband without any problems, right?"</span></p></div>
