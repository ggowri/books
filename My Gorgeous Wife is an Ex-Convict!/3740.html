        <h1>Chapter 3738</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However... the old Mason, although he spoke briefly, would still act affectionately towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he wouldn't do that kind of intimate affection anymore, would he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the movie ended, Jasper and William came over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sister Veronica, it's still early, how about having afternoon tea together?" Jasper said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at Mason and didn't see any reluctance on his face. His smile was so charming that she couldn't refuse him. "Okay then," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them went to a dessert shop in the mall and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, Jasper, and William were all good-looking and stood out in the crowd. Veronica, on the other hand, was quite ordinary-looking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Veronica put it, she was invisible in a crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them ordered some desserts. Jasper's eyes were clearly shifting between Veronica and Mason, while William seemed uninterested in Veronica and Mason and kept holding hands with Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the desserts arrived that William let go of Jasper's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sister Veronica, have you made up with Mason?" Jasper couldn't contain his curiosity and asked directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... I guess so," Veronica replied hesitantly. They should be considered reconciled now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you should come to Stanford University's campus festival with us. It's quite fun!" Jasper invited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Campus festival?" Veronica was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your school should have one too," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica shook her head. "My school had one a few years ago, but they haven't held it in recent years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you should come to Stanford University and check it out. Mason can be your guide!" Jasper said with a sly smile, clearly up to something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. Mason probably doesn't like such lively occasions," Veronica said quickly. She knew that Mason preferred quiet places.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that I don't like it. I can be your guide for the campus festival," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked confused, while Jasper happily exclaimed, "Great! Sister Veronica, remember to come and join us at the Stanford University festival!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Stanford University festival... Thinking back, she and Mason had welcomed many festivals together. At that time, she loved strolling around the festival and introducing everything to him non-stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he, like a loyal little tail, always followed behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at some point, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now... it's like repairing those lost pieces bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two girls finished their afternoon tea, they went to the restroom together, while the two boys sat at the table, staring at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious?" William suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What makes you think I'm not serious?" Mason retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just worried about Jasper. She's your sister, but she also has a good relationship with Veronica," William said, implying that he was afraid Mason might change his mind later and hurt Jasper's feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason remained silent and only spoke after a moment, "I am serious, but I can't </span><span>guarantee what the final outcome will be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William raised his eyebrows and asked, "Even if you were hypnotized, do you still want to pursue that person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Mason didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p></div>
