        <h1>Chapter 3980</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at Nancy in surprise. He never thought that things between her and his brother would be like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you never like my brother?" Jasper asked angrily. Although she was usually good-tempered, her good temper would naturally disappear when her brother was used like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't like him at first, I was just grateful that he helped me when I was in trouble," Nancy said frankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you thought you could use him because he helped you?" Jasper stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's body trembled. That familiar pain and guilt spread through her body once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." Facing her younger brother, she didn't want to hide anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Admitting these things takes a lot of courage for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are..." Jasper seemed to be at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it despicable?" Nancy summarized for him, "I know I'm despicable. If the Reed family intends to punish me, I'll bear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Punishment? Do you think punishing you will make a difference? Do you know what my elder brother..." Jasper suddenly slammed the table and stood up, shouting at Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the words stopped in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about your elder brother?" Nancy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper lowered his eyes. What he wanted to say was that his elder brother had never fallen in love with anyone before. He finally fell in love once, but was used like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, his elder brother was indifferent to matters of the heart. After experiencing such a betrayal, would his elder brother still believe in love in the future? Would he fall in love with someone else again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once this thought flashed through her mind, it made her more and more afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, you are indeed despicable. You use other people's feelings to achieve your own goals! I really misjudged you!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She once thought that the woman in front of her would eventually make his elder brother have feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it seems that this woman just raised a knife and stabbed his elder brother's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry!" Nancy apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that no matter whether facing Mick or Jasper, all she can do is apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this point, no matter how many apologies you make, what's the use?" Jasper said, "Now I already know what's going on between you and my elder brother. As for whether to punish you or not, that should be decided by my elder brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Jasper intended to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait! Jasper... no, Miss. Reed!" Nancy called out to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anything else?" Jasper looked at Nancy with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is your older brother now... is he okay?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Mick looked the same as when they first met at the hotel, she couldn't help but ask about his recent condition and whether he was okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at Nancy disdainfully, "At this point, what right do you have to know how my older brother is doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's body trembled suddenly, and her hopeful eyes became dim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, at this point, what right did she have?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper left, and Nancy was left alone at her seat.</span></p></div>
