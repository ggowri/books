        <h1>Chapter 3192</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes life can be really amazing, the difference between missing out and not missing out can be just a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So let's take a set of photos there," said Brian. "But even though it's not in tMason Swansonty center, there are still pedestrians on the streets nearby. When we take the photos, there may be people watching."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that she didn't like to attract too much attention, so he spoke up to remind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, wedding photos are only taken once in a lifetime, so let people watch if they want to," Valda said with a carefree attitude. "And if I marry you in the future, I might be watched by even more people, so it's better to get used to it now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian pulled Valda close and spoke softly, "Valda, I don't want you to marry me and force yourself to do things you don't enjoy. If in the future, you don't like being watched by others, I will provide you with a peaceful environment where no one will disturb you or gossip about you. I will do everything in my power to create the life you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked steadily at the man in front of her. He had protected her from the wind and rain, and had given everything for her. How could she not love someone like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian," she gently wrapped her hands around his neck and looked up, "I know you want to protect me, give me the best of everything, and let me live freely even after marriage. But for me, I believe that marriage is a two-way street that requires effort and compromise. If I am going to marry you, then I also want to take on my share of responsibilities. I don't want to be just a sheltered flower that you take care of. I want to face challenges with you and create our future together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The softness in his gaze intensified, she was truly becoming stronger through gradual change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her strength made him feel sorry for her, but it also made him love her more. "Okay, let's create our future life together," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He promised and lowered his head to kiss her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled sweetly and met his kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that the future would be even better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several scenes were chosen for the wedding photoshoot, mostly in the scenic area where the venue could be rented. However, for the set under the big tree, they had to try to take the photos during a time when there were fewer people around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first day of the shoot was for the set under the tree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda got up early to start doing her makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bride's makeup and styling naturally took a lot of time, but watching herself become more beautiful in the mirror was also a pleasant experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, when the makeup and styling were done, Valda walked out of the makeup room and saw that Brian had been waiting there for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, he was wearing a white suit, his black hair combed back to reveal a full forehead, his well-defined facial features and slightly enhanced makeup making him look even more refined and elegant, even better than many popular male stars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, Valda couldn't help but stare, and even a voice in her heart asked, "Is this man really going to be my husband soon?"</p></div>
