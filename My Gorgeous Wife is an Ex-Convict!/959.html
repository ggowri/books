        <h1>Chapter 958</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face would surface in his mind from time to time. Even at night, he would dream of when he met her on the hill, carrying her on his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was carrying that little girl on his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you don't love Jason anymore?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled faintly, but it was somewhat absentminded. "Does it matter whether I love him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had told her not to fall in love with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Brian was asking if she did not love Jason anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;All they want are results. They never care about what I want! All I want is peace!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at Grace, her smile and voice like invisible blades that pierced his heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was exhausted when she got off work. After all, too many things happened today. However, when she reached her neighborhood, she saw a familiar black car parked near her house. It had already attracted some people's attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Reed family's driver jogged up to Grace and said, "Miss Cummins, Master Reed's waiting for you in the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace paused for a moment and looked at the black car. 'Is Jason&hellip; in the car now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would normally enter her rental house right away whenever he came, but now... She hesitated and followed the driver to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver respectfully opened the door to the back seat, and Jason's figure immediately caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got into the car, and it slowly drove away from the neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are we going?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Reed Residence. I have a sudden craving for your cooking today, but it's a little inconvenient to do so at your rental house," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My cooking tastes average. It's nowhere near as good as the chefs at Reed Residence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what? Your cooking tastes the best to me." He chuckled. She used to cook when they were staying in the rental house together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she only cooked simple dishes and those meals were far from what he usually ate, he liked it very much. Perhaps he missed the feeling of eating her cooking with her more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to Reed Residence, and Grace followed Jason out of the car. She went to Reed Residence's kitchen. All kinds of ingredients were prepared and they were laid out, washed, and cut. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do I have to cook all this?" Grace asked, somewhat surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course not." Jason smiled. "You just have to choose some. Since there are just two of us, three dishes and one soup will do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips as she picked out some ingredients and started working on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Reed Residence's kitchen was familiar to her, so she did not need time to familiarize herself with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tomato omelet, shrimp stir-fry with lily bulbs, and green pepper with shredded pork... While she was cooking, he just stood and watched silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the final soup, Grace chose bamboo shoot soup with gourd. She added the gourd, bamboo shoots, and water into the pot before putting the lid on the pot, thinking the soup would be ready soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Jason's voice suddenly rang. "Brian went to your firm today. What did he say to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened as she felt a chill spreading through her body. She turned her head stiffly to look at the man who was a few steps away. "You know about it?"</p></div>
