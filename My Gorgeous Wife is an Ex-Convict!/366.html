        <h1>Chapter 365</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Does it mean that Young Master Reed wanted to be liked by Miss Cummins? Terrence knew the answer, but he still could not hide his surprise. Since when did Young Master Reed care about whether a woman liked him or not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Miss Cummins&hellip; suffered quite a lot before. I&rsquo;m afraid she can see things clearer than anyone. Plus, if you go hard on a woman like her, maybe she&rsquo;ll listen to you on the surface, but she might distance herself from you.&rdquo; Terrence analyzed the situation for Jason. &ldquo;From what I can see, Miss Cummins is the kind that prefers the soft approach. Why don&rsquo;t you try to humble yourself in front of her? Maybe it&rsquo;ll make her put down her walls.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;So, she&rsquo;ll only like me if I fawn over her?&rdquo; Jason muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence blinked, looking shocked. He&hellip; He just suggested that his boss should be humble. he did not say to fawn over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Um&hellip; If Young Master Reed wanted to fawn over this woman, then what kind of woman&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;How should I fawn over her then?&rdquo; Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence felt like there was something stuck in his throat. From his tone, did he really want to fawn over Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence&rsquo;s phone rang all of a sudden. After seeing the caller ID, he picked up the phone instantly. When he got off the phone, Terrence said to Jason, &ldquo;Young Master Reed, someone&rsquo;s investigating Miss Jennifer Atkinson&rsquo;s case from back then.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s eyes darkened. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know yet, but all we know is that there are different people collecting information from that year and searching for the witnesses. Plus, one of the witnesses in S City is being followed in secret,&rdquo; said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is it Mr. You?&rdquo; Jason frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, but the person investigating him right now is not the private investigator hired by Lina,&rdquo; Terrence said. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He already knew what was going on when Lina hired the private investigator to investigate the witness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything was fine. The evidence Lina found had been given to her by him. However, Terrence did not expect there to be some unknown people investigating this as well. They had not even found out who was the one investigating that case from back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his eyelids slightly and curled his fingers. His pointer finger tapped on the surface of his desk like he was thinking about something. After a while, he said three words, &ldquo;Hadwin.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Terrence was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Go investigate Hadwin. He might be the one investigating this.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Hadwin? Hadwin from Stephenson Group?&rdquo; Terrence said. He did not know how his boss connected Hadwin to this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; Jason said. If there were people who were skilled enough to prevent Terrence from tracking them, then Hadwin must be one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Hadwin was really investigating this, then it might be because of Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina&hellip; Jason rubbed his temple. He underestimated her. If Hadwin found something one day, then he might need to fight him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at Hadwin helplessly. &ldquo;You really want to meet my parents?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say your parents want to meet me?&rdquo; Hadwin asked lazily.</p></div>
