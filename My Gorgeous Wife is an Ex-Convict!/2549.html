        <h1>Chapter 2547</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell would be married to Herman Moss tomorrow while holding his memorial tablet. What would the expression on George Gregory's face be when he heard the news?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera was suddenly a little curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in tMason Swansonty knew that George Gregory had courted Amber Mitchell back then. Was it true that such passionate love no longer existed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is it. Let's use this style for tomorrow. Also, I'll wear another bracelet tomorrow," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tomorrow, she would wear the bracelet Herman gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, about the ring..." the stylist said a little hesitantly. After all, Amber Mitchell had lost her right ring finger. It was the finger she should wear the wedding ring on, but she... would never be able to wear a wedding ring again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell glanced at her mutilated right hand with a faint smile. "I'd better wear it on my left hand. I still have my left ring finger." Even if her left ring finger were missing, she would wear it on her other fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The stylist nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell turned and said to the others, "That's it for now. I want to stay here alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The stylist and her assistants left the room. Whitney Herrera asked, "Amber Mitchell, do you plan to live in the Moss family&rsquo;s house?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'll go back to my rented place. But I'd like to take some of Herman's old clothes and things with me as well as some of his photos. I'd like to have some of his things in my place." That way, maybe she could imagine that she was living with Herman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll speak to Daley Moss about it. There should be no problem," said Whitney Herrera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whitney, thank you," Amber Mitchell said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're welcome," said Whitney Herrera as she left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was instantly left alone in the huge room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked at herself in the mirror. She was wearing a white wedding dress, had elegant makeup on, and donned luxurious jewelry. She looked like one of tMason Swansonty's top socialites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never imagined that one day, she would wear a wedding dress for Herman Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was currently standing in Herman's room in a wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Herman, do you like the way I look?" Amber Mitchell murmured. Traces of him seemed to fill the room, but he could not answer her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">the Moss family chose to hold a ceremony for Amber Mitchell's marriage to Herman Moss in the Moss family's cemetery. Only some of the Moss family's relatives attended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The information was kept private, and the Moss family did not want to make a big deal out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, they had told the media not to report on the Moss family recently. If the media published news reports, the Moss family would retaliate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a sunny day. Amber Mitchell had already put on her wedding dress early in the morning and finished getting styled with the skillful hands of the stylist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Holding Herman Moss's memorial tablet, she arrived at the cemetery in a car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a faint smile on her way there. It was the day she was most looking forward to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she stepped out of the car, Daley Moss looked at Amber Mitchell. "You still have a chance to back out. Otherwise, you have no way of backing out after we put a new tombstone on Brother's tomb that has your name on it."</p></div>
