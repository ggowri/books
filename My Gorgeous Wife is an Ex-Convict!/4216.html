        <h1>Chapter 4214</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's parents and Chandler arrived outside the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina said bitterly, "Tina really forgot about us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as she's still alive, that's all that matters!" Hadwin said. Now, the most important thing to him is that his daughter is alive. Whether she remembers or not, whether her memories will recover in the future, it all seems less important in the face of life and death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina understood this reasoning, too. "But she cares so much about Kit, and then there's Chandler..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina's gaze fell on Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past six months, she witnessed Chandler's almost madness, and she knew how much this man loved Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Tina went missing and was found by Kit, the police also questioned Kit and made a statement. From Kit's statement, as well as Tina's worry about Kit when she first woke up, Lina knew that perhaps the person her daughter encountered first after forgetting everything was Kit, who rescued her from the village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under these circumstances, coupled with Kit's lies, it wouldn't be surprising if Tina developed some kind of feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Tina really fell in love with Kit, what should Chandler do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts, Lina became filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler calmly said, "I don't mind as long as Tina is still alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, for him, the most important thing is that Tina is still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina breathed a sigh of relief. "It's really good that you can think like this. But Tina just temporarily lost her memory. Give her some time, I believe she will recover her memories."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina continued, "Also, now that Tina is awake, why don't you go see the child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By "the child," she naturally meant the premature baby Tina gave birth to, a daughter. But ever since the child was brought back to Emerald City from the small town, Chandler had never gone to see her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had a strong aversion to seeing the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go see the child with Tina when the time comes," Chandler said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although disappointed, Lina could only nod. After all, she couldn't force him. She didn't know what resentment Chandler had towards the child, but he was still the child's biological father and would eventually accept her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the doctor conducted a preliminary examination on Tina and determined that she had passed the critical period, she still needed to stay in the hospital for a while for treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was finally good news, and everyone present breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, because Tina had just awakened, she fell asleep again shortly after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, Chandler asked Lina and Hadwin to go back first. "I'll stay here with Tina. You can come and see her tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in the past few days when Tina wasn't awake, they had practically been </span><span>guarding the ward day and night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Lina wanted to spend more time with her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doctor has already said that Tina is out of danger now. You also need to rest well. Tina's recovery will require a lot of energy from you!" Hadwin said. "And there's also Tina and Chandler's child, who needs your care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Lina felt that he made sense and nodded her head. After all, since she found out about her daughter's whereabouts, she had hardly had the chance to rest so well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then please take care of Tina, Chandler. Let us know if there's anything." Lina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler lowered his head slightly and said, "I know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Hadwin and Lina left, he sat alone by the bedside, watching the person sleeping on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of anything else, for him, the fact that Tina is still alive is the best thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for not remembering anything before, being deceived by Kit's lies, he can tell her the truth again and again when she gradually recovers.</span></p></div>
