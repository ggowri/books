        <h1>Chapter 3566</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then...then I'll accompany you," she quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll accompany me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I'm free anyway, so I'll go to the bookstore with you. Besides, I also want to buy some books," she smiled. After all, he hadn't finished his milk tea yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced at her and didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them arrived at the bookstore, and Roger was browsing the books on the shelves while Valda quickly took the bubble tea from his hand. "Let me hold this for you. You can pick out your books and drink your tea, but don't take too long. It's best to drink it within an hour, otherwise the taste won't be as good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he replied, noticing that she was particularly insistent on him drinking the bubble tea today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper simply walked over to the rest area of the bookstore, where there were some tables and chairs. She picked an empty table and sat down, then casually picked up a comic book and pretended to read it. However, her eyes kept stealing glances at Roger, who was not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So far, he hadn't even taken a sip of the bubble tea. Valda thought this task wouldn't be difficult, but now she was starting to doubt it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can she really get the straw with his saliva on it smoothly today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Roger... could he be Lawrence? This guess flashed through her mind once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the moment, Roger was leaning on this side of the bookshelf, holding a book in his hand and flipping through it. The light from the lamp and the outdoor sunshine merged together and fell on him, making him look like he was enveloped in light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are too many uncertainties about Roger that William investigated before he was 14 years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, he is also likely to be Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was leaning on the desk, with her hands supporting her head, looking at him sideways. The warm sunshine shone through the French windows onto her body, making her fatigue more apparent. Jasper fell asleep unconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Roger walked to the table, Jasper's eyes were closed, and the corners of his mouth were slightly upturned, as if he was dreaming of something beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned slightly. Was this woman so defenseless?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She fell asleep in the bookstore like this, wasn't she afraid of someone doing something to her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hesitating for a moment, he took off his coat and covered her with it. Then he sat opposite her, lowered his head and looked at the book in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passes little by little, as if warm and beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper felt like she had a beautiful dream where she saw Lawrence again, but she couldn't remember the details when she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What caught her eye were rows of bookshelves and all those books... She suddenly realized that she was in a bookstore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She... she actually fell asleep in the bookstore?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What about Roger?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper suddenly straightened up and turned her head, only to find Roger sitting in front of her with a thick original book in front of him, and he was looking down at the book.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry, I...I fell asleep," she said, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you used to falling asleep in public like this?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could that be possible!" she retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then what was that just now?" he mocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her embarrassment became more apparent on her face. She was probably too embarrassed to say that she fell asleep while looking at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, her eyes caught sight of the two cups of milk tea on the table. The cup that was originally meant for him was already half-drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You drank the milk tea?!" she exclaimed in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, did you buy this cup of milk tea for me to drink?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"N-no, it's not like that. You should drink it," she quickly replied. "Is it good?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then keep drinking, finish it quickly. If the milk tea sits for too long, it won't taste good," she urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gave her a suspicious glance and picked up his milk tea, then started drinking again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In no time, he finished his cup of milk tea.</p></div>
