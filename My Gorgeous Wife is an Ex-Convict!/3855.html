        <h1>Chapter 3853</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Veronica looked at Mason's expression and asked, "Are you... jealous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sudden sentence caught Mason off guard, causing him to pause. He then awkwardly covered his lips and avoided eye contact, seemingly unsure how to face her gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you jealous?" She persisted in asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Veronica exclaimed, "Oh!" and placed her hand on Mason's ear. "Mason, your ear is red."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop touching it," Mason stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her touch made his ear particularly sensitive, and a strange sensation exploded throughout his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he let this feeling continue, he would...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your ear is so soft and comfortable to touch," Veronica seemed addicted, continuing to rub and knead his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This feeling... it's really addictive! How did she not notice it before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed that just touching the earlobe was not enough, so she began to scratch the inner wall of his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the next moment, everything spun around, and when Veronica regained her senses, Mason had already pressed her down onto the back seat of the car. Then, a partition slowly rose between the front and back seats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on? What are you doing?" Veronica looked puzzled. However, being pressed down by Mason and separated from the front seat, the back seat became a closed and narrow space, making Veronica feel like the air around her was heating up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you think I want to do?" Mason's voice was slightly hoarse. He leaned over, and their bodies pressed together. His fingers touched her ear. "Is the ear fun to play with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was unbearable! Veronica's body trembled, feeling as if all the blood in her body had rushed to her ears. Even her toes curled up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're in the car, and the driver is still in the front seat..." She forced herself to speak, feeling her ears burning hot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she touched his ear, she didn't feel anything. But now that he was the one touching her ear, she realized that the feeling was indescribable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, the driver won't care about what's happening behind him. Besides, we're separated by a partition, he can't see anything," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even if he can't see anything, he can still hear us, thought Veronica to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if he had guessed what she was thinking, he whispered, "If you really don't want the driver to hear anything, then just don't make any noise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" She was startled, and then her body trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's lips had already kissed her earlobe, and the closeness of their bodies made her acutely aware of his physical changes and the increasingly heavy breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she understood what he meant by what he had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Don't make any noise... but how is that even possible?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face turned bright red, and she regretted touching his ear so recklessly. If she had known it would be like this, she would have at least waited until they were alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't bite your lip, you'll break it," Mason whispered in her ear.</p></div>
