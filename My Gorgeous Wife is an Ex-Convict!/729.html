        <h1>Chapter 728</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace pushed open the door to the president's office, she could only see the tall figure standing by the French window that overlooked the skyline of Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly found that the image in front of her was almost like a poster. He simply stood there as if he had the entire Emerald City under his control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was true that he did have the ability to rule Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked so different from the fragile, lonely man she had seen in the wee hours of the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason," she said aloud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned his head around and looked at her. A slight smile appeared on his lips. "You're here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I brought you lunch. See if you like it." As she spoke, she walked with familiarity to the coffee table and put down the lunchboxes and fruits in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He came over, opened the lid of his lunchbox, and sat down on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt as if she had gone back to the days when she had lunch with him in the office every noon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it good?" she asked expectantly, not knowing whether the lunch she had chosen was to his taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not bad," he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good." She breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, don't you get headaches a lot these days? Why don't I make an appointment with a doctor for you to check out your headache?" he asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a sudden pause in the movements of her hand, she replied hastily, "It's alright. Didn't I see a doctor before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That doctor obviously didn't cure you well. Didn't you have a headache again at the fair?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately felt guilty. "I... I went to another doctor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. "Did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes&hellip; Yes." She lowered her head and continued to eat her lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as though when he looked at her like this, her guilt grew stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she did not look up, she could feel his eyes on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you want me to find you a better doctor?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks... Not for the time being at least. I&rsquo;ve already made an appointment with the doctor to go back tomorrow and after that... Uh, I'll see what happens," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After tomorrow, I'll know whether I've lost my memory and whether I was the little girl who encountered Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Just after tomorrow... I'll tell him all about it tomorrow when it's settled.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure. Let's wait till tomorrow." Jason's voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her head bowed, Grace did not notice the flash of gloom on Jason's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they finished their lunch, Grace put away the lunchboxes. Then, she naturally picked up a paring knife and apple. She asked Jason, "Do you want an apple? I'll cut one for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." His voice was slightly deeper than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Grace concentrated on peeling the apple, Jason looked at the woman in front of him as she began to peel the apple clumsily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather, it was a little difficult for her fingers to grasp with precision.</p></div>
