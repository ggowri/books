        <h1>Chapter 3093</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">A while later, Grace took a step forward and hugged Valda tightly, exclaiming, &quot;Valda, you&#x27;re finally back! Thank goodness!&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">As her words trailed off, sobs followed, and Grace couldn&#x27;t help but cry as she held onto Valda.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda slowly raised her hand and hugged Grace back, saying &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m back, Grace. Don&#x27;t cry. I&#x27;m here now, aren&#x27;t I?&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">But Grace cried even more sadly because Valda clearly wasn&#x27;t okay, she was hurt so badly.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m sorry...&quot; Grace</span></span></span> <span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">kept apologizing, &quot;Valda, I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m sorry for causing you so much pain.&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Stop it,&quot; Valda comforted. &quot;Grace, we were both victims. If anyone should be sorry, it should be Whitney and Phoebe. But they have already faced legal consequences.&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">At that moment, Grace realized that Valda might be the kindest person she had met in the world. And Brian was head over heels for her probably because of it.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda’s kindness wasn’t that eye-catching at first. But when you got to know her better and spent more time with her, you would find yourself gradually immersed in it. And before you knew it, you would probably become reliant on it.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;By the way, how is Jasmine doing?&quot; Valda changed the subject.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;She&#x27;s doing well, I&#x27;ll bring her to see you next time,&quot; Grace said, releasing Valda.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda raised her hand and wiped away the tears from Grace&#x27;s face, &quot;It&#x27;s okay, Grace. You really don&#x27;t have to feel like you owe me anything.&quot; </span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">As she said this, her gaze also turned towards Jason and Brian standing beside her, &quot;None of you owe me anything. Really. I don&#x27;t want everyone to always feel like they owe me something.&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Anyway, the fact is that you saved Jasmine. So, the Reed family owes you a favor. If you need any help from us in the future, just tell me,&quot; Jason said seriously.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda looked at Jason, hesitated for a while, and then smiled and said, &quot;Okay, thank you.&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;I should be the one saying thank you,&quot; said Jason.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Valda, can you tell me what happened to you this past year? Where were you? How did you come back?&quot; Grace had many questions she wanted to ask.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda didn&#x27;t hide anything and told them everything that happened in the past year. Of course, she heard about what happened during her coma from Lisa.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Although she was trying to downplay everything as much as possible, Grace still felt extremely uneasy</span></span></span> <span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">when hearing it.</span></span></span></p></div>
