        <h1>Chapter 1367</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was their turn to get on the merry-go-round, Kyla Corbyn realized the ride spun faster than it appeared to when she was looking at it before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had been eating very little due to her illness, she still had an urge to vomit, especially since the spot where her liver was seemed to ache again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson's exclamations were full of joy. She knew her son was happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand clutched the nearby handrail tightly. She stiffened, trying to control all the discomfort in her body. She did not notice that Martin Weiss's eyes had fallen on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A spinning ride like this was naturally nothing to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Joining the little one in this childish ride was a new experience for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing his son's surprised voice, he felt a strange sense of joy and pride that he had never felt before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it blood kinship?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he have this feeling because Nelson was his son? After all, he had never been one to like children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he saw Kyla Corbyn&rsquo;s pale face, furrowed brows, and the thin layer of sweat breaking out on her forehead, he could see that she was trying to tolerate her discomfort. The ride was fun for Nelson but painful for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he began to regret what he had said earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the spinning finally stopped, Kyla Corbyn said to Nelson with difficulty, "I'm... going to the restroom. Wait here with Daddy." With that, she almost ran to the restroom in a panic and retched over the sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had not eaten anything before going out, so there was nothing she could throw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got out of the restroom, the little one did not notice anything wrong with her and clamored to ride the Ferris wheel. However, Martin Weiss could clearly see Kyla Corbyn's discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you feeling?" The question came blurting out of his mouth just like that, and even he could not tell whether he was concerned about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine," she replied faintly, but her eyes were always looking at Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was all she could see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they reached the Ferris wheel, Martin Weiss suddenly grabbed her. "If you're not feeling well, just wait down here. I'll take Nelson up by myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him with some surprise. "No thanks. I'm not afraid of heights." With that, she broke away from his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three of them got on the Ferris wheel. Kyla Corbyn took out her phone and said to Martin Weiss, "If you&rsquo;re okay with it, I'll take some pictures for you and Nelson. I can send you all the pictures afterward. I won't save any pictures here. Or I can use your phone if you're worried."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said lightly, "No, your phone will do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she replied. She had expected him to refuse and even thought of another way of saying it. However, she had not expected him to say yes so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one was obviously happy to take a photo with his dad. He jumped from Kyla Corbyn's side and approached Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at Martin Weiss in the camera. His face had the same solemn expression. However, since he was willing to take pictures with Nelson, he must have some fatherly affection for Nelson.</p></div>
