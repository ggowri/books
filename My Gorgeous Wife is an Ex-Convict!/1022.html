        <h1>Chapter 1021</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gently coaxed him, and soon, the little one fell asleep. Kyla Corbyn then muttered, "I just hope Nelson won't be discriminated against when he starts kindergarten."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who dares discriminate against him? I'll go to the kindergarten and stand up for him!" Lina immediately said. She did not believe she could not handle a few children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled. She envied Lina's character sometimes. She was just as fearless as she used to be. However, she could never be the same after everything she experienced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, thank you so much for the custody case," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've already talked to the firm and Lawyer Carter has agreed to help. Don't think about it too much," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn nodded. Speaking of which, she was surprised that Martin Weiss chose a court in Emerald City to hear the case. She thought he would choose a court in S City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, S city was his territory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since he had chosen Emerald City, she did not have to travel back and forth between two cities, which saved her a lot of effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now that you've sold the small restaurant, are you going to get a job?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll set up a food stall for now. I'll take care of the rest after the lawsuit is over," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A food stall? A roadside food stall?" Lina was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I start in the evening and close around 3 A.M. I've been doing it for more than a week, and it's doing okay. The money I&rsquo;m making is sufficient to support me, my mom, and Nelson," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn&rsquo;t running food stalls hard work?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A little, but the jobs I can do are limited. I'm just setting up a stall where I cook some noodles and appetizers. The money I earn from doing these is alright. Besides, I've set up food stalls before I opened the small restaurant, so I have some experience," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew how hard life could be for a woman who had been released from prison. She had trouble finding a job too when she was released from prison. Besides, Kyla had to make a living for her mother and son as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at the time and said, "It's almost time to set up my food stall, so I'm not going to eat dinner with you today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I'll go with you. I'm free anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll come with you too!" Lina interjected suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, the place is... a bit far. I'm riding a scooter, so you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll drive Grace to the destination and wait for you there. Just tell me the specific location," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the three of them headed to the place where Kyla Corbyn set up her food stall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they were there, Kyla Corbyn began to lay out some folding tables and chairs, along with ingredients, tools, and so on. Grace and Lina also gave her a hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they set up everything, Lina was already sweating and could not help admiring Kyla Corbyn more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was already exhausted after doing it for a while, not to mention Kyla Corbyn who usually did everything herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The customers had also started to arrive. Kyla Corbyn expertly cooked the food while Grace and Lina helped her wipe the tables and serve the food.</p></div>
