        <h1>Chapter 2365</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla instantly came to her senses and blurted out, "We're... married. It should be okay to touch your face like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flash of surprise in his eyes as he smiled. "Yes, we're married."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he straightened up. "Don't sleep in the living room. Sleep in the bedroom so you won't catch a cold."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She answered, "Okay. Have you had dinner? I left some food for you. You can eat some after reheating it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice broke off in the middle of the sentence. She saw the time, and it was already 10:00 p.m. He should have had dinner at this hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uhh... I didn't realize it's so late now. You must have already eaten. I'll clean up the food in the kitchen." She got up and walked toward the kitchen as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He grabbed her. "You made dinner?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I was going to eat with you," she murmured in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you call and tell me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was going to call, but... you seem to have blocked my number. I can't get through to you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His brows furrowed slightly as if he recalled something. Then, he said, "Starting tomorrow, you can call me on my phone. Also, I'm a little hungry now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said as he went to the kitchen and reheated the cold food himself. He then brought it to the dining table and began eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla kept him company at the dining table. She watched Martin Weiss eat mouthful by mouthful. She seemed worried the food was not to his taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, Martin Weiss finished all of the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll have someone come over and cook every day, so you don't have to exhaust yourself. Also, cleaners will come and clean the unit every afternoon. I'll also assign a caretaker to take care of you," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "No thanks. I can take care of myself. Besides, it's just cooking, I can&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss interrupted by saying, "What if you get another bellyache like what happened at the train station? Do you think you can handle it? What will you do if there&rsquo;s no one around you? Your phone might run out of battery or it might not be with you. You won't even be able to dial 120!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was instantly rendered speechless. She remembered the pain, and she knew he was telling the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You might be having the baby less than two months from now. I don't want anything to happen to my baby!" he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I got it. I didn't think it through earlier," said Kyla. She watched him finish the food and intended to clean up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll do it," he said, taking it upon himself to take the dishes and put them in the dishwasher to wash before putting them away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stood at the kitchen door as she watched the back of the man in front of her. Her eyes could not help watering again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the life she wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was now realized in such a way.</p></div>
