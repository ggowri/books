        <h1>Chapter 2661</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That man looks like a typical rich kid. He should be rich. Could it be him? If he did spend a lot of money to protect Valda, then... could he really just be fooling around with Valda?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman suddenly panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If that man is serious about Valda, is there any chance I can start over with Valda?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or... am I never gonna get that chance?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller did not end up staying with Camille Strickland. Instead, Camille Strickland helped her find a serviced apartment online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The serviced apartment was relatively far from downtown. One had to swipe a card to get in and out of the entrance downstairs, so it was quite safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stay here for a few days first. I&rsquo;ll bring you food every day," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could you laugh at a time like this?" Camille Strickland asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just have the feeling that we're behaving like fugitives all of a sudden. Would someone call the police if you secretly bring me food every day?" Valda Theller said as she sought joy amidst the sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland thought about it and agreed. However, she clenched her teeth. "I wonder which bastard did this to you? Why did they expose something that isn't the truth?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the person who exposed this was in front of Camille Strickland right now, she would have smashed their head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While swearing, Camille Strickland pulled out her phone to check the latest online gossip posts about her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a cry of surprise soon escaped her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The... The viral post about you..." stammered Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about the viral post about me?" Valda Theller asked. If it either rose or dropped a few spots in the ranking, it did not matter to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The viral post about you is gone," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was surprised. She hurriedly got closer and saw that the viral post about her was indeed gone as her best friend said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened?" Valda Theller took out her phone and searched again. All negative gossip news about her was gone. Only some positive ones were left. There was nothing negative about her in the comments too. It was obvious that someone was controlling the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was a little overwhelmed. "What on earth is going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland also looked confused. "Someone must&rsquo;ve suppressed the viral post," she said after thinking about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who is it? Boss?" The boss Valda Theller mentioned was the boss of the magazine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, how could I not know if that was the case? I don't think it's the film producer either. They would&rsquo;ve let me know if it was them." Camille Strickland analyzed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face flashed across Valda Theller's head. 'Could... Brian have helped me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, the viral post is gone. This matter will die down sooner. You can get back to your old life in a few days." Camille Strickland let out a sigh of relief and said, "I gotta go. I'll bring you your dinner later."</p></div>
