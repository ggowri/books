        <h1>Chapter 1273</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the good news today was that Lina was getting better and would probably be able to transfer out of the ICU in the next couple of days. Then, it would not be long before she could have a second operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sent Kyla Corbyn home after visiting Lina. However, the driver suddenly stopped the car when they were halfway there. Grace was immediately stunned. Soon after, she found that their car had been surrounded by several other black cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a figure got out of their car and walked to Grace's car. The bodyguard, who was sitting at the front, also got out and stopped Brian at the car door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced faintly at the bodyguard. The men behind him went straight over, and several of them immediately broke into a fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the bodyguards Jason had assigned to follow Grace had all been carefully selected, Brian had more men with him, so Grace&rsquo;s bodyguards were subdued in no time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked to the car door near Grace and opened it. Grace caught sight of his handsome but haggard face. "Grace, I have something to say to you," he said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned and said, "You could just say whatever you wanted to say. Why do you have to use such a way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I don't do this, I'm afraid I'll never have a chance to talk to you,&rdquo; Brian smiled wryly and said, "I just want to find a quiet place and have a few words with you, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was bordering on pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips as she looked at the state Brian was in. It reminded her of how he had risked his life to save her and ended up with blood all over his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he had saved her and the children's lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I can go somewhere quiet to talk to you, but please let them leave." She pointed at the bodyguards who were subdued, the driver, and Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Brian said readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace!" Kyla Corbyn said in worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, don't worry. I'll ask the driver to take you home first. I'll be fine," said Grace. She turned and said to Brian, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several cars sped away after Grace got into Brian's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn sat in the backseat, anxiously watching the departing car. The bodyguard quickly took out his phone and reported the situation to Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's car drove to his private mansion. Grace's expression changed slightly as she passed the open space in front of the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had once stood here all night. At that time, he had been her only hope. She had desperately hoped that he would meet her and help her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, he was probably the only lifeline she could hold on to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was not even given the chance to speak to him when she finally saw him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed to guess what Grace was thinking and muttered, "It was my fault that day. I shouldn't have avoided you. I shouldn't have caused you so much pain by doing nothing when you needed help so badly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all in the past," Grace said lightly as she lowered her eyes.</p></div>
