        <h1>Chapter 3201</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding emcee is reciting a prepared script.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When it was time for the bride and groom to exchange vows, Brian held the microphone and looked at Valda. He said, "Valda, thank you for coming into my life. I know I didn't protect you well in the past and you suffered a lot of pain. But from now on, I will protect you with my life. As long as I'm alive, I won't let anyone hurt you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked surprised for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian is currently using a script that was prepared during the rehearsal, but he has also added some parts on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, today you have married me, and I will never let you leave again. For me, there is only one person who can become my wife, and that is you. Only you can truly make me happy and bring me joy. So, from now on, please stay by my side and let me protect you and love you, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes became moist, "Okay, I won't leave you, Brian. I love you too. You are the person I love the most in this world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian picked up the wedding ring, took Valda's hand, and put it on her ring finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the future, you belong to me," he murmured softly, speaking with a voice that only they could hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda picked up the men's ring and took Brian's hand. She put the ring on his ring finger and said, "From now on, you belong to me too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As her voice trailed off, he lowered his head and kissed her lips. The surroundings fell silent, then erupted into thunderous applause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace watched happily from the audience as Brian and Valda embraced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They say true love always finds a way. You should let go now," a familiar voice suddenly whispered in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace turned her head and met the familiar peach blossom eyes of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He understood her well. He knew that if Brian and Valda missed their chance, she would blame herself for a lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I can relax now," Grace smiled slightly. "They will be very happy in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So will we," Jason said, gently taking Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Holding hands and growing old together, nothing is better than this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">***</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding banquet continued, with Valda and Brian toasting the guests. Many people were chatting with each other, as it was a rare occasion to gather so many celebrities and film industry bigwigs. It was a great opportunity for people to meet and get to know each other better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for the children who came to attend the banquet, they ran and played in the banquet hall, adding a lot of lively atmosphere to the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was led to the bathroom by her nanny. The nanny was supposed to lead her back to the main hall, but while they were walking down the hallway, they suddenly heard a melodious piano sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper suddenly stopped in her tracks. She plays the piano, so she naturally pays extra attention to the sound of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she stood still, listening to this piano piece.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just a moment, she recognized that it was Liszt's super challenging Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the person playing the piano may not be very fluent, there is a wonderful rhythm in the sound of the piano that gives people a beautiful feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Jasper, it's time to return to the main hall," the nanny on the side urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait a bit longer," muttered Jasper, unable to resist the urge to follow the sound of the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wants to know who is playing this song.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, Ms. Jasper, where are you going?" The nanny hurried to catch up, but she didn't dare to forcefully take Jasper back to the main hall. After all, she was Mr. Reed's most beloved third daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll see who's playing the piano!" said Jasper.</p></div>
