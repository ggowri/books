        <h1>Chapter 4045</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Speaking of which, this was also a good trait in Tina's character. When she didn't have an answer to something, she wouldn't obsess over it and wouldn't try to understand it immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She believed that there would be a solution when the time came, and she would understand it in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the wedding reception drew to a close, Tina began to feel restless. Her gaze began to follow Kit, who was not far away. When she saw Kit stand up, Tina immediately stood up as well and said to her parents, "Mom, Dad, I'm going to find someone. I'll be back soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh? Who are you going to find?" Lina hadn't finished her sentence before her daughter had already rushed off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Chandler also stood up and followed Tina's figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Chandler following her, Lina breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With Chandler here, nothing will go wrong," Hadwin said to his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina is impulsive. If Chandler wasn't here, who knows how many people she would offend. I just hope she can behave herself today and not cause any trouble," Lina muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, many of the people who came here today were important figures. If her daughter really got into a conflict with someone, it would not end well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if she does offend someone, there's nothing to be afraid of," Hadwin didn't seem to care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, he was the head of the Stephenson family and had the White Maple Group in his hands. He naturally wouldn't be afraid of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If his daughter really made a mess, he would help clean it up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In no time, Tina had reached her target - Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hi Kit, I'm Tina. I'm a big fan of yours and I'm so happy to meet you here today!" Tina greeted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello," Kit politely smiled and responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most of the guests who were able to attend this wedding had some background, so even though Kit didn't know Tina, he didn't treat her like an ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My friend and I both really like you. If it's possible, could you give us your autograph? One for me and one for my friend," Tina continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina quickly took out the autograph paper and pen she had prepared beforehand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Write 'TO Eugenia' on one, and 'TO Tina' on the other." Tina smiled sweetly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit skillfully wrote on the autograph paper according to Tina's request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Tina naturally admired the "beauty" of the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit's appearance is different from Chandler's strikingly deep and handsome looks, leaning more towards delicate and elegant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two can be described as one having a bold makeup style, and the other having a light makeup style.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the moment, Kit did not wear heavy makeup like on stage to highlight the stage effect. He looked a bit more approachable, like a boy next door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you staring at others?" Suddenly, a voice sounded in Tina's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked up and saw that Chandler had walked up to her without her noticing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want an autograph!" Tina said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, a middle-aged man who had been standing next to Kit spoke up, "Mr. Hunter, nice to meet you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler looked up and said to the middle-aged man, "Mr. Ingram, nice to meet you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While the two were chatting, Kit had already finished signing and handed the autograph paper and pen to Tina.</p></div>
