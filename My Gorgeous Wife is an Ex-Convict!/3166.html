        <h1>Chapter 3164</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, in other words, she pretty much remembers what happened last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially the memory of Brian dancing, I haven't forgotten it at all. After all, it was too precious. It was his first time dancing for her to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about this, she regretted a bit. If only she had taken a photo with her phone yesterday!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What a precious sight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I don't know when I'll be able to see him dance with her again in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing lunch, Valda went to the hospital again for rehabilitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her legs may never fully recover to the level of a normal person, there is still room for improvement. This can help her walk with less difficulty and turn corners without too much trouble. With the help of specially designed shoes, she can even walk in a way that appears similar to that of a normal person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is something she is capable of doing, so she will work hard to do it well, even though rehabilitation like this is very difficult for most people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for her, who has come back from the brink of death, this kind of hardship is nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda gritted her teeth and followed the instructions of the rehabilitation therapist, performing each movement one by one. Even though some of the movements were painful for her, she persevered and continued to do them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian arrived here, he couldn't help but feel his heart tremble as he watched Valda receiving rehabilitation treatment inside through the transparent floor-to-ceiling windows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She who was doing rehabilitation inside, had a face full of redness, with sweat dripping from her face and body. Her clothes were soaked with sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gritted her teeth and persevered, even though some movements made her tremble with pain. Despite the intense discomfort, she continued to push through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that this was her effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he could only watch helplessly, unable to do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he has an unparalleled position of power and wealth that others can only dream of, and even though he can do things that others cannot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when it comes to Valda's matter, he can't do much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that her leg would be his lifelong pain! If he had protected her well in the first place, if he had eliminated those "hidden dangers" more thoroughly, she would never have encountered such a thing, let alone limping on one leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So from now on, he will protect her even better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian stood in front of the transparent floor-to-ceiling window, watching Valda do her rehabilitation exercises until they were finished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Valda walked out of the rehabilitation room, sweating profusely, she saw Brian standing outside. She was surprised and asked, "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come and take a look," he said, suddenly opening his arms and embracing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, I'm sweating a lot," she hurriedly said, wanting to break free from his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But instead, he held her even tighter, "Don't move, even if you're covered in sweat, I still want to hold you." He whispered softly, "Rehabilitation...must be very difficult."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not too bad, compared to when I first woke up..." She stopped halfway through her sentence, afraid to continue and reveal the pain she had gone through, causing her to feel even more guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he knew what she was going to say. "Valda, I will protect you from now on and make sure you don't get hurt again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know," Valda said. "Brian, you've always been protecting me. Although rehabilitation may seem difficult now, it's only because I'm just starting. It will get better once I get used to it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know how to help you ease your pain," he murmured, feeling helpless and defeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, "Then just appear in front of me and keep me company! Even if it's hard, it won't feel so hard when you're with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Appear in front of you?" He paused and looked down at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, appear in front of me! Isn't there an idiom that says 'beauty can be appetizing'? Beauty can be satisfying enough to eat, so it can naturally ease the pain!" Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian couldn't help but laugh at her twisted logic!</p></div>
