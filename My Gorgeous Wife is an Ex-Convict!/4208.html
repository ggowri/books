        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The incoming call showed an unfamiliar phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not many people knew his private number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler frowned and answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hoarse male voice came from the other end, "Is this Mr. Hunter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is this?" Chandler replied in a low, hoarse voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Kit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When these words came through from the other end of the phone, Chandler's expression instantly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news he had just seen made it clear to Chandler that Tina was now with Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Tina? How is Tina?" Chandler asked urgently, wishing he could rush to the other end of the phone immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina is currently in the hospital, she just gave birth and had surgery, so she is very weak and still unconscious. The doctors say it's best to transfer her and the baby to a better hospital." Kit's voice was low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was undoubtedly a heavy blow for Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Kit's words, Chandler had already understood that Tina and the baby were in a very bad condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina is currently at..." Kit mentioned the name and address of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Chandler grabbed his car keys and rushed out of the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary was startled and quickly followed, "Mr. Hunter, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to pick up Tina and the baby. Keep your phone on 24/7. Also, find the best surgical hospital and pediatric hospital in Emerald City. When I arrive at the hospital, I will send over Tina and the baby's medical records. We will immediately organize a consultation with the experts. I want them back in Emerald City so we can start treatment quickly." Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" The secretary quickly responded, feeling overwhelmed by the influx of information.</span></p></div>
