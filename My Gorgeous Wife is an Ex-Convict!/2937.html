        <h1>Chapter 2935</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? You've been staring at me." Brian Hart's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was just thinking about how I should repay you for saving my life," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pitch-black eyes fixed on her, "Valda Theller, you don't need to repay me for anything, nor have I ever thought about you repaying me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whether you want me to repay you or not is up to you, but it's my responsibility to do so," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want to repay me with? Money? Gifts? Or perhaps, your body?" he retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed and didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, Valda Theller, to be honest, I didn't think too much when I saved you. By the time I realized it, the knife was already in your body. It was just my instinct to save you. So you don't need to feel guilty or blame yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Regardless, if we ever encounter any danger in the future, I will protect you and risk my life to do so," she said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her earnest little face, as if she was always serious about everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you planning on encountering danger again in the future?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She realized her words were inappropriate and awkwardly bit her lip. "Well...um, forget what I said. We won't encounter any danger in the future, we'll be safe and sound!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her embarrassed expression was adorable, and Brian Hart couldn't help but smile. With her around, his mood always seemed to improve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a nurse came to change Brian Hart's bandages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller trembled and held her breath as she watched the nurse remove the gauze and reveal the eleven stitches on his wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time she saw his wound, she felt like she couldn't breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart's face remained expressionless as the nurse changed his bandages, but Valda Theller's face twisted in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the nurse finished, she finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If someone didn't know any better, they would think you were the one injured. When the nurse was changing your bandages, your expression looked like you were in so much pain that I thought you were going to scream," Brian Hart joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because it really looked like it hurt," Valda Theller said, looking at Brian Hart's calm expression. "You...you're not really in pain?"</p></div>
