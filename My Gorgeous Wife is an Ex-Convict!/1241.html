        <h1>Chapter 1240</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace once felt that her father-in-law should not have left his young child behind. He had chosen to die because he could not bear the loss of love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... he must have loved his son with all his heart. Otherwise, Jay would not still miss his father so much after all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll strive to be a good wife and a good mother. I'll work on this marriage," she said seriously and truly thought so as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she had chosen to take this path, she wanted to make it a good choice. Even if the only thing that bound her to Jason was their children, she still hoped that at least their children would have a harmonious family&mdash;not one full of strife and resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she finished speaking, she turned her head and found Jason looking at her. Those ink-like eyes looked as if they were covered with a layer of yellow light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What I said... it&rsquo;s all true," she said a little uneasily as she faced his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you swear on it?" he said slowly. His cold voice sounded somewhat solemn in the ancestral hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Swear?" She was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, swear. Swear before my father's tablet that you'll never leave me again, and you'll stay by my side until the end of our lives!" His voice rushed into her ears and pressed on her heart like a heavy mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This oath was too serious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips together and kept quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled faintly with a hint of sarcasm. "Come on, let's go back to the main house." It did not matter if she was unwilling to swear. He was never going to let her go anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just as he turned to leave, her voice sounded behind him. "I'll swear!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stopped dead in his tracks and turned his head back in disbelief. He saw her thin figure saying word after word as she faced the tablet, "From now on, I won't leave Jay unless he wants to end this marriage. I&rsquo;ll be by his side for the rest of my life. Dad, please be my witness!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice was soft but firm. Her pretty profile was dim under the lamplight, but it was so attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned to look at him with a faint smile. "Now, are you willing to believe what I say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A wave seemed to be stirring in his heart at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that by using Lina's treatment and the babies to force her to marry him, she would be reluctant. Maybe she would be sad, resentful, or end up crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had considered all kinds of situations and even told himself that he did not have to care about what her reaction would be. He just wanted to keep her trapped beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not expect her to take such an approach toward their marriage. When she had told Brian the word &lsquo;willingly&rsquo;, did she know that after he heard that, what flashed across his heart was joy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had told himself not to believe what she said so easily. Once he believed, what he might get in the end was an overwhelming disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If you had no expectations, you would not be disappointed, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she was looking at him firmly as she smiled. It was both quiet and gentle. When he looked at her at this moment, it was as if he was seeing the person she was before&mdash;the woman who would keep him in her heart, love him, and once said she would protect him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman was the first woman he called &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; and the first woman he fell in love with!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I... going to let myself fall into this again and bring everything I have to her feet, including my trust and dignity?'</p></div>
