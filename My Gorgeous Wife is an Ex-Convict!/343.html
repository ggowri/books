        <h1>Chapter 342</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated a little before saying. "Nothing. It's just that after you took me to my room, I saw that you didn't go back to your room but headed to the stairs. I wondered if there was something wrong with you. Uhh, If you're all right, I'll go..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, however, a pair of arms encircled her from behind. "Are you worried about me, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's whole body seemed to be enveloped in his scent, and for a moment she did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Worried? Was she worried about him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed confused. Was it because he saved her tonight? Therefore, instead of thinking of him as Jason tonight, she was taking him as Jason and worried about him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was thinking about it when suddenly his breathing seemed to fasten in her ear. There was a faint muffled moaning in his throat. His arms, which had encircled her, gradually loosened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around and saw that Jason was now pale with beads of sweat on his forehead. He was holding his hand over his upper belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shuddered, remembering suddenly that she had seen him like this before. "Have you gotten a stomachache again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You seem to remember my old faults, Sis," he muttered, and a smile crept from the corner of his mouth. However, the paleness of his face and the apparent suppression of pain in his eyes somehow made his smile seem vulnerable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly helped Jason up and looked around. There was nowhere to sit, so she went inside. There was a sofa in the room. She helped him to sit down on the sofa. Then, she drew a piece of tissue from the coffee table in front of the sofa and wiped the sweat on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is the pain sudden?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't pay much attention to the pain earlier. I thought it would go away soon. I didn't expect it to hurt this much all of a sudden," he muttered. "I didn't expect you to remember my old faults, Sis. It seems that you care about me, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Grace did not answer that question. Did she care&hellip;? She did not even know the answer to that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where's your medicine? Do you have it with you?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't like them very much. I'll just wait for the pain to pass and I'll be all right," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't like them? I bought you medicine last time, didn't you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you bought it. How can I not eat what you bought?" Come to think of it, he took his medicine on time every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless. The problem was that she used to live in an urban village previously and there was a pharmacy nearby. There was no 24 hours pharmacy around Reed Residence at this time of night!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servants in the mansion must have gone to bed by now. The only people still awake were probably the security guards here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, is there security here at night? Is there someone who can take a break and drive out to get some medicine?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to make me take my medicine again, Sis?" Jason asked with some difficulty. The pain in his stomach brought chills to his body. He was also sweating more and more.</p></div>
