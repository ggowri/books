        <h1>Chapter 4132</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Kit returned to his private residence in the evening, he saw his father in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Everything today was your doing, right?" Kit spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, it was my doing. In the elevator, you had some alone time with Miss. Stephenson. I'm sure your feelings must have deepened," Edmond admitted straightforwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit's expression changed. "Why would you do this? You know that I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You mean, you know about your claustrophobia?" Edmond nonchalantly chuckled. "It's precisely because of your claustrophobia that I had someone tamper with the elevator. Women are more likely to be sympathetic in these situations, especially Tina, who already had a favorable opinion of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit pursed his thin lips, gripping the hand that hung by his side tightly. His father would never understand the fear he felt when darkness engulfed him, when his symptoms flared up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The fear of being alone in the darkness, as if no one else existed. His father would never comprehend it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Tina hadn't been by his side at that moment, or if she had kept her distance or simply observed coldly instead of approaching him and soothing him, he wouldn't be here now, unharmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Or maybe his father wouldn't even care if he knew about his fear, as long as he could achieve his goals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I did all this for your own good, for the Ingram family. You have to understand that the Ingram family is your support. The stronger your support, the better your development!" Edmond earnestly explained. "Think about why your teammates don't have resources as good as yours. In the future, when they go solo, their development won't surpass yours because your support is stronger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit remained silent. His father's words made it seem like all his efforts were insignificant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, you can find opportunities to interact with Miss. Stephenson again. Make her develop other feelings for you. That way, she can speak more favorably of the Ingram family," Edmond suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit continued to remain silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing his son's demeanor, Edmond furrowed his brows. "What's the matter? Have you grown wings and stopped listening to me? Let me tell you, even though you're my son, I can give you everything now, but I can also take it away. Don't forget, I'm the one who brought you out of nowhere!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I haven't forgotten," Kit slowly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Good. You don't want to experience destitution again, do you? You should know that many idol stars, without support, end up poor and destitute. Don't easily be blinded by the pursuit and extravagance of the entertainment industry!" Edmond said, patting Kit's shoulder before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit was left alone in the living room. After his father left, his face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could he forget?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In his childhood, he grew up in an orphanage. The director and the caretakers told him that his mother abandoned him there because he was born out of wedlock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">During his time in the orphanage, he endured bullying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, a man appeared before him and said, "I am your father, and I've come to take you away from here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that time, he thought that luck had finally come to him, but little did he know it was just another nightmare!</p></div>
