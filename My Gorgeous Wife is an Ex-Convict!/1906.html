        <h1>Chapter 1904</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jason, believe it or not, you'll never meet another woman who will love you more than I do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's enough!" he snapped immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Everyone in the video conference instantly shut up, and no one dared to say another word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In particular, the senior executive who was giving his presentation turned ghastly pale. He thought there was something wrong with his report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence quickly whispered to Jason, "Young master Reed, what are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason opened his eyes, came back to his senses, and realized that he had lost his composure just now. "That's all for today. Let's end the meeting," said Jason as he turned off the video conference screen, got up, and walked out of the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wanted to get some air outside to get rid of the voice that rang in his ears from time to time. However, once he got outside of the house, the air seemed to be filled with her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, Jay...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You'll never meet another woman who will love you more than I do...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Never meet..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason suddenly held onto a pillar in the corridor and gasped in a fluster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does she love me that much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Could she be the one who loves me the most?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If she loves me that much, why did she...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, there were suddenly hurried footsteps behind him. Terrence's voice rang. "Young master Reed, something may have happened to Young Madam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you mean?" Jason froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence quickly said, "Well, Young Madam asked the personnel you assigned to her to find Miss Lina. They found out that Miss Lina got into Katherine Jackson's car at the women's hospital. Young Madam asked the men to keep tracking Lina down, but after a while, she called them and asked them to stop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence paused. Looking at Jason's increasingly ghastly expression, he continued, "Later, our people noticed that Young Madam drove away in an unfamiliar car, so they called Young Madam but she said she wanted to run some errands alone. She also asked us to put aside the ingredients she prepared in the kitchen yesterday that she initially planned to cook for a meal with you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes. "Did she prepare anything yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I've checked with the kitchen but Young Madam didn&rsquo;t prepare any ingredients," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'In other words, she made something non-existent sound so real. She also mentioned my name...' Jason's eyes gleamed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is something really wrong? Is she asking me for help in this way?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason immediately said, "Have someone check her driving route. Do it secretly. Don't let anyone find out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," Terrence answered quickly and hurried away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason felt uneasiness all over him... 'Is she... under Katherine Jackson's control?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He never expected the woman he had never taken seriously to be a time bomb!</p></div>
