        <h1>Chapter 1029</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you disappointed?" Lina asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson smiled faintly and said, "It's alright if you're not pregnant. We'll have children in a few years. Alright, you can come out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said helplessly, "I can't! I&rsquo;m having my period and I don't have any sanitary pads with me. Why don't you go out and buy me some?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's expression froze. "Buy you some sanitary pads?" It was the second time his voice went out of tune tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. Do you want me to come out all bloody?" she said, emphasizing the word &lsquo;bloody&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll ask my servants to buy some," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly said, "No! It's embarrassing to get your servant to buy such a thing. Why don't you buy it yourself? You know what? When I was in school, I envied girls who had boyfriends who would buy sanitary pads for them. I even imagined having a boyfriend who would buy some for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson could not understand why she would envy having a boyfriend who would buy her sanitary pads and fantasize that her own boyfriend would buy her some too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are sanitary pads, uh, that important?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he saw the expectation in her eyes, Hadwin Stephenson knew he would give in again this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he could only say, "Wait here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No problem!" She immediately smiled sweetly and added, "Buy me night use pads from Whisper!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was rendered speechless and had an indescribable feeling in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed he kept buying things he did not usually need tonight. The problem was... he kept getting weird looks from people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson was at the check-out counter with two packs of sanitary pads, he was once again greeted by a strange look from the cashier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After paying the bill, he heard the cashier say to the cashier beside her, "Did you see that? That guy just bought sanitary pads!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He probably bought them for his girlfriend or his wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, a man who's willing to buy sanitary pads is a good man!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm so envious of that woman!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Hadwin Stephenson realized it was not Lina's logic that was bizarre but women&rsquo;s in general!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina came out of the bathroom after putting on the sanitary pad, she was clutching her stomach. She frowned slightly, her face looking paler than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you feeling uncomfortable?" Hadwin Stephenson asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just a little stomach ache," said Lina. She met Hadwin Stephenson's concerned eyes and hurriedly explained, "Don't worry. I get cramps the first two days of my period!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pondered for a moment and asked, "What would make you feel better?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I feel better after drinking some brown sugar ginger tea, but do you, uh, have the ingredients?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll get someone to buy some right away if I don't have them!" he said. He ordered his servant to make some brown sugar ginger tea while making her lie down on the couch with a cushion on her waist and a little blanket over her stomach to make her feel comfortable.</p></div>
