        <h1>Chapter 2077</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she had forgotten that the man before her was drunk. Saying that would only trigger him more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're mine, Kyla. You're mine... I forbid you to fall in love with someone else... You can't..." Martin Weiss frantically kissed Kyla as he tore her clothes apart with both hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She resisted as hard as she could, but it only made him more violent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She felt his kisses and scent all over her, yet she could not even refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Tears... could not stop rolling out of her eyes. Kyla sobbed while crying out, "Martin Weiss, don't make me hate you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not hear a thing and had his way with her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla desperately washed her body with warm water in the hotel bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There were marks all over her body telling her what had happened! She never expected this to happen when she dropped him off at the hotel out of pity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was desperately trying to distance herself from this man, but just now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was fruitless no matter how she struggled or cried just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He kept whispering in her ear how much he loved her, yet he forced her into doing such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After bathing for some time, Kyla came out of the bathroom. She looked at Martin Weiss lying on the bed asleep, and a complicated look flashed across her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was hatred and also something else...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Finally, she awkwardly put on her clothes and quickly left the hotel without looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Just think of tonight as a bad dream. Everything will be the same again when I wake up.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Kyla returned home and found that her mother and Nelson were still asleep, she breathed a sigh of relief. Then, she changed out of her clothes, stuffed them into a large garbage bag, and threw them away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want to see those clothes anymore. The sight of them would remind her of how helpless she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was just like how she could only accept whatever he gave, regardless of whether it was good or bad. He was so domineering that he would not allow her to resist or struggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, Mrs. Corbyn saw her daughter in a turtleneck and could not help asking, "Why are you suddenly wearing a turtleneck?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's getting a little cold, so I took out my high-collared clothes." Kyla made up an excuse. If her mother saw the marks on her neck, she would probably figure out what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla felt restless all morning, and what had happened the night before kept replaying in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had kissed her, touched her, and spoke drunkenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, I love you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, do you know how much I miss you? I'm suffocating from the thought... I wish I could turn back time so we could go back to the way it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, please love me...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You have my liver in your body... Besides my liver, I would even give you my heart. This... This... must be what it means to give someone your heart..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He repeated again and again in Kyla's ears.</p></div>
