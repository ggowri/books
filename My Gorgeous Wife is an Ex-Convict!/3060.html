        <h1>Chapter 3058</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, I will do everything I can to find her," Jason said. "Whether she is alive or dead, I want to see her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace burst into tears when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did Valda have to pay the price for us? Why..." Grace cried, "It's my fault as a mother for not protecting Jasmine. Why did Valda have to suffer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace!" Jason hugged his wife. "It's my fault. I didn't protect our daughter or save Valda. It's all my fault. I will use all my strength to find Valda. Maybe... maybe she's lucky enough to survive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Jason knew that the chances of Valda surviving were very slim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, Jason!" Grace hugged Jason and cried until she fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason picked up Grace and carefully laid her down on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that she had been resting very little these days, constantly worrying about her daughter. Just now, upon hearing about Valda's accident, her emotions became too overwhelming. Coupled with exhaustion from these past few days, she fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Jason watched Grace's tearful face, he felt a wave of guilt and pain in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that if anything happened to Valda, it would be a lifelong pain for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, Grace," he murmured. He had once vowed not to make her sad or upset, but she had been let down. She was still sad and upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lifted his hand and gently wiped away the tears on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda will go and find them, and the one who started this will pay the price and suffer a fate worse than death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, did you know? I like seeing you smile."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whose voice is it? Who is talking to him?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I will try my best to make you fall in love with me! But you have to promise me that if one day you do fall in love with me, you will tell me first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound continued, making him feel so attached that he even had the urge to cry. He just wanted to treasure this sound and keep it safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the way, that's... Valda's voice, it's Valda's voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, do you have even a little bit of love for me? Even just a little bit?" That's... Valda asking him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And how did he respond?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He...he didn't answer, he just remained silent. But his silence had already given her the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was clearly very sad, but she still put on a brave face and said it was okay. She said she was just too impatient and that she would continue to wait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he fall in love with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Do you have a little bit of a crush on her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears clearly made him feel so uncomfortable, but why wouldn't he tell her? Why didn't he even give her the answer "a little bit"?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The screen turns again, and the surging waves rush towards her, while she is looking at him from afar and saying to him -</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, thank you for liking me and please don't be sad for me. One day, you will definitely meet someone whom you will truly fall in love with again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she was still grateful to him, and he was still considering her, hoping that she could find someone who truly loves her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She's always like this, thinking of others, but leaving all the pain to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She didn't even consider her own well-being, not even in the face of death!</p></div>
