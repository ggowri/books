        <h1>Chapter 2597</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But that would require us to appeal to the court, which would take at least six months. Besides, once the media finds out about it, it won't be good for Weiss Group's reputation either," Kyla said with red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. Her eyes were wet. It was as if her tears would form again and fall from her eyes at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart twitched suddenly as her crying face kept flashing across his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to say to him while crying, "Martin Weiss, believe me. I didn't push Paisley Daniels down the stairs. I didn't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had also cried as she shouted in a voice that could break people's hearts, "Martin Weiss, I beg you! Let me go. Let me go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, she said in a calm voice through her tears, "Martin Weiss, I&rsquo;ll never forgive you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all memories of her crying back then. He no longer had those feelings and should feel like an outsider when he recalled these memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why... did his heart ache?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart... hurt so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then he said to her out of the blue, "Then let's make a bet one last time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would stop having this uncomfortable feeling as long as he won the bet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so uncomfortable that... even breathing seemed to hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla would stay in Martin Weiss's mansion. However, she did not move into the master bedroom. Instead, she stayed in the guest room. It was as if Martin Weiss was indicating that she was merely a &lsquo;guest&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But this is good too! At least I'm closer to him now,' Kyla told herself. Unexpectedly, she and Martin Weiss ended up like this after all the events.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One more bet. One last time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Martin Weiss really had no feelings for her and did not want to stay with her, she would set him free and sign the divorce papers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she wanted to fight for herself first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla motivated herself in the guest room, while Martin Weiss returned to his room, his face paler than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had noticeably begun feeling more tired than ever since the operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the first donation, he did not feel anything significantly wrong with his health, but the second donation was different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Despite his poor health, he strangely had no regrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did he donate his liver a second time? The doctor had told him before the surgery what the consequences would be, but he chose to donate anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because of that letter? Was he afraid that he would regret it for the rest of his life if the hypnosis accidentally undid itself one day?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It... did not seem that way. It seemed that all he could think about was... saving her!</p></div>
