        <h1>Chapter 3227</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Camille sighed and agreed, "Okay, I'll tell you everything I know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Valda returned to the villa, she saw Brian sitting on the couch in the living room, flipping through some documents. When he heard her footsteps, he looked up at her with a gentle gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're back," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly rushed into his arms and exclaimed, "Brian, I love you so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know, I love you too," he replied. Although he was a bit puzzled by her sudden confession, he was very happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the future, I will stay by your side and won't mind if you assign more bodyguards to protect me. It doesn't matter how many you send," she continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" he asked, confused. "Is it because you were almost kidnapped before and now you're scared?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head and said, "I am a little scared, so please don't let me encounter any danger in the future, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he responded, "don't be afraid, I won't let you encounter any danger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her head rested on his chest, listening to the sound of his new heartbeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, it's not so much that she's afraid of being kidnapped, as she's more afraid of what he might become if he loses her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, I listened to Camille talking about Brian from that year. What Camille knows is not everything, but just hearing the part she talked about made her heartache terribly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know there was so much she didn't know!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, he loved her much deeper than she had imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She always thought that she was the one who gave more in their love, but it turns out that he didn't give any less than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She feels truly happy to be loved so deeply by him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and Brian arrived at the Reed House the next day with their honeymoon gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family, including the husband and wife and their four children, gave a total of six gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After receiving the gifts, Mick politely said "thank you," while Jasper smiled sweetly and chatted away. He even kissed Valda on the cheek. As for the gifts for the triplets, Mason, and the youngest daughter Jasmine, Grace helped collect them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Mason planning to continue living with the Barlow family?" Valda asked. Among the children, Mason was the hardest to come by. Every time he visited the Reed family, he was nowhere to be seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Grace said. "He's used to living with the Barlow family, so we're just letting him stay there. Whether he wants to come back and live with us in the future is up to him, we won't force him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the Barlow family couple, Grace, is not appreciated, fortunately, they are not very cunning and tend to follow the crowd. As long as enough money is given, they are not afraid that they will do anything harmful to Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Grace quite liked the Barlow family's girl - Veronica. She could see that as Mason grew older, his attachment to Veronica not only did not diminish, but also increased day by day.</p></div>
