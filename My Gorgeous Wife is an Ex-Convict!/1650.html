        <h1>Chapter 1648</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So you don't care about the memories you don't remember?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as he spoke, she fell silent. She knew he was referring to the memory of her leaving the Reed family and falling into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she did not remember, she had gotten a general idea from Terrence. Jay just... had no idea about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes stared at her as if he was observing her reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She took a deep breath and said to him, "All that matters to me is our present time together. I would like to remember my past with you if it's a good memory. If they're bad memories, then I'd rather forget about them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You'd rather forget?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I would," she said. She would rather not recall those painful memories. Perhaps she would not realize how intense the pain was if she could not remember.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a pause, Grace raised her hand and caressed Jason's face. "Jay, if you really want to recover your memories, why don't you let nature take its course? Don't do it at the expense of your health. All that matters to me is that you keep living."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, Jason felt another sharp pain in his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Keep living...' When the words came out of her mouth, his heart seemed to be pressed by countless heavy boulders. He could not breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How can I keep living if you're gone..." the words just blurted out of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even he was stunned when he said it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why would I say something like that? Besides... it was as if I had said it countless times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'When did I say that? Was it after she fell into the sea?' However, his head hurt even more when he desperately wanted to think about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His face grew paler. Large beads of sweat broke out on his forehead while moans spilled from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace hurriedly said, "I'll go get you your medicine. We'll talk after you take them!" With that said, she turned around to fetch the medicine when his arms tightened around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, let go. I'll go get the medicine for you or your headache will worsen," she said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't go. I don't want you to go!" At this moment, he looked like a drowning man who was desperately trying to hold on to the only piece of driftwood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm just getting your medicine," she explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was as if he did not hear her. He pushed her onto the bed and kissed her repeatedly. He pushed their bodies closer together as though this was the only way to make him feel that she was right beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why did she still want to leave me when she said she had forgiven me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is there another reason for this? Did I do something else later to annoy her? Or... did she hate me so much that she lied about forgiving me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Perhaps she was only willing to stay with me because her memory hadn&rsquo;t recovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If she recovered her memory one day, would she still want to stay by my side?'</p></div>
