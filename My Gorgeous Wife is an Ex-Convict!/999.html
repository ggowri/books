        <h1>Chapter 998</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the silent mourning hall, his phone started ringing. Jason picked up the phone, and after a moment, he replied, "Okay, got it. I'll come over later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Putting away the phone, he looked at the memorial tablet again. "I'm indeed your son. I&rsquo;ve put a woman before my own life. It's as if I'll lose the meaning of life if the woman ever abandons me. However, I'll never end up like you. Never!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Jason turned around and left the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, who was guarding outside, was immediately delighted when he saw Jason coming out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get the car. Let's go to the hospital to see the old man," Jason ordered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the black sedan slowly pulled out of Reed Residence and headed toward the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hospital's top VIP ward, a frail old man lay in bed as the doctor talked about his current condition. After a moment, he waved his hand impatiently and said, "Just tell me how long I've got to live."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor said reluctantly, "Six months if all is well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if it's not?" Old Master Reed asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Four months," said the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright. Get out of here. Just give me whatever treatment I need. I'll cooperate fully," said Old Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor and nurses left the ward. Old Master Reed lay on the bed, telling his private secretary, "Wake me up when Jay is here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he answered. The once-mighty old man now lay weakly in a hospital bed, spending the last few months of his life here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason walked into the ward, he only saw the Old Master Reed lying asleep on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed was thinner than he was the last time he came to see him. His cheeks were hollow, and his hair was thinner because of the medicine. He looked as if there was a dead air hanging over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The old man&hellip; has gotten old after all.' Looking at Old Master Reed who was weak and asleep, Jason had mixed feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed's private secretary tried to wake him up, but Jason waved his hand and said, "Let him get some sleep. I'll wait."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the secretary said nothing more and stepped aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sat on the couch, waiting for Old Master Reed to wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After more than an hour, Old Master Reed woke up slowly and saw that Jason was already here. He asked the secretary who was nearby, "Why didn't you wake me up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master told me to let you sleep." The secretary helped Old Master Reed to sit up as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You purposely had someone call me here. What's the matter?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed said, "I heard you're back with that woman, Grace, again. Why didn't you break it off properly? When did you get so sloppy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled. Old Master Reed said it was hearsay, but of course, someone had been gathering information for him. Old Master Reed's desire for control had not diminished in even the slightest despite his body having weakened to such an extent that he needed to be hospitalized.</p></div>
