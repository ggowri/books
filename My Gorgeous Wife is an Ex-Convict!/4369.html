        <h1>Chapter 4367 Birthday Wish</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need any gifts. Just having you join me for dinner today makes me really happy," Calvert said sincerely. The pure honesty in his eyes made Harley understand that he was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if a meal like this was truly a great gift to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was always the case that the more content the other person was with the current situation, the more she wanted to give them something even better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley found her attitude towards Calvert a bit odd. They weren't particularly close, and Calvert had made it clear that a meal was more than enough. Yet, she still wanted to give him something more substantial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just had a meal together, that doesn't count as a gift. Think about what you really want as a present," Harley said with a smile. "I don't have many friends I'm willing to give gifts to, so you better think carefully. Otherwise, you'll have to wait until next year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's heart suddenly started racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next year? So that meant, she was still with him to celebrate his birthday last year?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was secretly thrilled because of these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could you come with me to the amusement park? I kind of want to check it out," Calvert said hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An amusement </span><span>park</span><span>?" Harley paused, seemingly surprised by the unexpected request. "Are we going now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The amusement park in Emerald City was an hour's drive away. Given that it was already noon when we decided to drive there, we probably arrived close to two in the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, if you were planning to go to an amusement park, you would have headed over there bright and early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're too busy, just forget I mentioned it. We can talk about it later when you have time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go to the amusement park then!" Harley said, "Today's your birthday. After we finish eating, I'll drive you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stared blankly at the person in front of him, a complex feeling welling up in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really said yes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually agreed to go to the amusement park with him. Did this mean he held a small place in her heart?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even just a little bit was enough to make him happy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the two finished their meal, they got into Harley's car. However, Harley first </span><span>drove</span><span> the car to the entrance of the supermarket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me a second," Harley said, stepping out of the car and into the supermarket. Moments later, she emerged, her hands filled with a few newly purchased masks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley got in the car and said, "You've gained some fame now, so put on a mask later. This way, we can avoid unnecessary trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked down at the mask in her hand, wondering what she meant by "unnecessary trouble".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it have been that she didn't want others to see her hanging out with him? Was she afraid that rumors might start circulating about them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert, who was previously happy, now feels somewhat disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert took the mask and responded, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they arrived at the amusement park and bought their tickets, Harley noticed that even with a mask on, Calvert still managed to turn heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was already tall, but after becoming a model, his hairstyle and fashion sense underwent a transformation. Coupled with his deliberate body sculpting and the model's catwalk stride, he had exuded an overall aura that was even more impressive than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert had been like a piece of gold covered in dust before, but then, as the dust was slowly being wiped away, it naturally began to shine with an attractive glow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things had kept going like this, they might have played around a bit more and someone might have recognized Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Harley quickly pulled Calvert towards her.</span></p></div>
