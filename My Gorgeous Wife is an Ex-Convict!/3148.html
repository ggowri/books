        <h1>Chapter 3146</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a pair of arms wrapped around her from behind, and she felt his hot breath on her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, just one year, I'll wait for only one year. After that, I want you to become my rightful wife! By then, you can't use any excuses to delay it anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda lowered her head and looked at her hands that were wrapped around her. A smile curved her lips as she said, "Okay, one year. I will definitely marry you after one year!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marry him, have children together, and live happily ever after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian finished packing up Valda's things and was ready to leave, there were indeed many reporters gathered outside Valda's apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Brian was prepared beforehand and had a large group of bodyguards to keep the reporters at bay. Valda was able to get into the car safely without incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was just filmed getting on the car with a limp, and then it was uploaded online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, the news that the Crown Prince's fianc&eacute;e is actually a cripple has exploded on the internet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my god, how could the prince find someone with a lame leg!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does the prince have any particular preferences?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could it be that the Crown Prince has been caught with some kind of handle?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did this woman threaten the Crown Prince? Otherwise, why would it be difficult for the Crown Prince to find a suitable woman? Is it necessary to look for a woman like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Online, there are all kinds of opinions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Tracy is gleefully looking at these derogatory comments about Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more negative comments there are about Valda, the happier Tracy becomes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda has caused her so much trouble, now Tracy wants to make Valda suffer too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, the more Valda suffers, the more leverage Tracy has.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Brian really wants to clear Valda's name, Tracy is the best person to help her! As long as she reconciles with Valda and says a few words on her behalf, the online attention will naturally shift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about this, Tracy feels even more proud of her plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Tracy's mother, Mrs. Barlow, is not as optimistic as her daughter. "Tracy, you underestimate the Hart family and Brian. Do you really think you can control Brian with this kind of public opinion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, I'm not trying to control him. I just want to apologize to his fianc&eacute;e online. As for the rest, it's not my problem. I can't control what the netizens say. Anyway, if Brian really loves his fianc&eacute;e, he should come to me to clear her name," Tracy confidently replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Mr. Barlow finds his daughter's idea ridiculous. If it were that easy to manipulate him, the Hart family wouldn't be sitting at the top of the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He regrets spoiling his daughter too much in the past, making her think the world is so simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tracy, you will regret everything you've done today," Mr. Barlow said. His mood has been like a roller coaster these past few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought his daughter would apologize to Valda properly, but instead, she caused this incident. He could almost see the downfall of the Barlow family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps the only thing he could do now was to tidy up everything and prepare an escape route for his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Regret? Why should I regret?! Dad, soon the Barlow family will be just like before. As for me, Brian might even give me more good resources!" Tracy shamelessly declared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a day of fermenting online, the situation had escalated even further!</p></div>
