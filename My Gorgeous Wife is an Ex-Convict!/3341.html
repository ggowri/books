        <h1>Chapter 3339</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the afternoon of the day after tomorrow, Grace and Jason will take their two children to see a musical. Originally, Grace wanted to bring their eldest son along as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, Mick directly expressed that he is not interested in musicals and that he has an online group to manage, leaving him with no time to spare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Group meeting?" Grace paused for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I joined a group of online program enthusiasts. I'm the administrator. We have a discussion meeting this afternoon, and unless there are any special circumstances, I have to attend," said Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace was stunned, "Are you the administrator? Are all the people in the group elementary school students?" Are elementary school students nowadays already creating groups related to network programs?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not really, I'm just an elementary school student," said Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did they make you an administrator? Do they know how old you are?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know," Mick replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace furrowed her brows and asked, "Do they also know about your family background?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know about that, I haven't said it," said Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So how did you become an administrator?" Grace asked curiously. After all, it's not normal for a 10-year-old child to become an administrator in a regular group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, I won based on my abilities. I defeated seven people to become the administrator," said Mick. Despite his usually calm demeanor, he couldn't help but feel proud when talking about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seven people?" Grace wasn't surprised at all. After all, she knew her son was quite skilled in computer technology, and even though he was young, beating seven people wasn't that surprising.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, it's 7 people! There are a total of 9 people in our group, and I only lost to the group leader." said Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How old are they?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are a few who are still studying, and a few who have jobs," said Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mummy doesn't object to you making friends online, but when making friends online, you still need to be cautious and not reveal all your personal information. Do you understand?" Grace reminded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand. We agreed in our group not to inquire about each other's information," said Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace finally felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the afternoon, Grace and her group set off. Jasper and William looked like a lovely couple, attracting many people's attention when Grace walked into the theater with the two children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, William was wearing a navy blue wool coat with a pair of plaid trousers, giving him the appearance of a young gentleman. Meanwhile, Jasper was dressed in a cream-colored sweater and a knitted skirt, with a cute and sweet beret on her head.</p></div>
