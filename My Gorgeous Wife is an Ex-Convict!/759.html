        <h1>Chapter 758</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it did not look as terrible as when he was a child, the scenes here were deeply imprinted in his mind. He was always recalling them over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked down quietly, seemingly recalling something, but his face seemed to be stained with a layer of loneliness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Brian, Grace suddenly felt a little uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Here they had gotten through thick and thin as well as experienced life and death together. The two small figures were like comrades, as thick as thieves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now there seemed to be gulf after gulf between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know what it's like to miss someone?" Brian's cold voice suddenly rang in the silent and empty forest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was slightly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian did not seem to be asking her for an answer. Instead, he said to himself, "When you miss someone, you carve that person in your mind, put them on your mind, and think about her all the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a slight curve on the corners of his mouth. Soon, a smile spread across his face, but the smile seemed unreal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like a snowflake. As long as the sun shone on it, it would disappear in an instant...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ve been missing someone since I was 11 years old, but I couldn't find her all these years. Have you ever felt that kind of despair? There should be such a person in this world, but you just can't find them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. She knew that he was talking about her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's voice continued ringing. "When the yearning became some kind of despair, I was constantly on the lookout for people who look like her. As long as they looked similar and as long as I could see some traces of her, this yearning wouldn&rsquo;t feel so desperate anymore." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and looked at the man in front of her in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is that... Why he looked for those substitutes?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rumors said that the crown prince of the entertainment industry was passionate but also ruthless. Who could imagine that he looked for substitutes just to keep him from despair?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never approved of him finding substitutes, but... She could not help but sympathize with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she knew she was the one he was looking for, her heart was filled with a complex feeling that she could not even describe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, are you really not the one I'm looking for?" He turned his head and looked straight at her with his deep, sultry phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were so quiet and deep, just like a calm deep sea with no waves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Grace had a feeling that the person in front of her was just waiting for her to give him the final blow and let him give up completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her lips were a little dry, and she exhaled before saying, "Yes, I'm not the one you're looking for. Didn't you already find Stella? Why ask me such a thing again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled suddenly. "Yes, I've found her. Why am I asking you such a thing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when he looked at Stella Lindsay, he felt nothing. It was as if she was only a stranger to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, Stella is the girl who saved my life. In any case, I&rsquo;ll repay Stella well.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you mustn't come here again. I don't want to see you in this place." Brian's face returned to its usual indifferent and distant state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want her to stand on the edge of this cliff. It would only make his mind more confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would take back all the misconceptions and feelings he had put on her and would no longer be disturbed by her. From now on, she was nothing to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, his eyes, his voice, and his expression all seemed to tell her that everything... Was going her way.</p></div>
