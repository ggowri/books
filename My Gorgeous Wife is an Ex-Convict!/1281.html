        <h1>Chapter 1280</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The question is whether he knows that he's tempting me to commit a crime? Especially when he takes off and puts on his clothes, revealing that lean and strong body of his. It's more exhilarating than some commercials, giving people the urge to make the man theirs...' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... I'm still pregnant," she said pointedly. In other words, no matter how tempted she was by looking at him, there was nothing she could do with him in her present state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then make up for your love for me right now. I'll let you go on top after you give birth to the babies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately felt as if she was going to have a nosebleed. 'Oh my God! What kind of conversation is this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help feeling a little sweet at the thought of this. She seemed to feel a lot more relaxed after talking things out with Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In these two days, she completed some unfinished work on hand, and only Kyla Corbyn's case was left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as Kyla had a criminal record, Grace felt they had a great chance of losing the custody case. However, they could only go ahead with it under the premise that no negotiation was possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to her pregnancy and the fact that Jason had assigned bodyguards for her, the firm gave her a private office to use temporarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had already planned to stay at home and nurture her babies once Kyla's first trial was over. She had no plans to stay in the firm for long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the boss of the firm was very polite to her after he knew that she had married into the Reed family. He hoped she could stay in the firm forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace's phone rang. It was Kyla Corbyn calling. However, as soon as Grace answered it, Kyla Corbyn's anxious voice came from the phone. "Grace... Can you help me find Nelson? Nelson's missing. I... I can't find him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "Nelson's missing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The kindergarten had a fall trip today. He ended up fighting with the other kids in his class and disappeared. I&rsquo;ve searched everywhere and even called the police, but the teacher also doesn&rsquo;t remember when Nelson disappeared. Several surveillance cameras near where it happened are also out of service." Kyla Corbyn started sobbing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there anywhere he could have gone to? Or was he picked up by someone? Maybe Aunt picked Nelson up and forgot to inform the teacher?" Grace gave various possible scenarios.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My mom didn't pick up Nelson, and probably no one else would..." Kyla Corbyn's voice suddenly stopped as a possibility occurred to her mind. "I'll go and see Martin Weiss!" With that, Kyla Corbyn hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Did Martin Weiss take Nelson? But with Martin Weiss's character, it was unlikely he would take someone away in such a sneaky way.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he wanted to, someone like Martin Weiss would have chosen to take Nelson away in front of Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Grace called Jason and asked Jason to have someone find Nelson's whereabouts. Kyla would probably go crazy if something happened to Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Grace got pregnant, she became more aware of how important children were to their mothers. Just like her, who would be miserable if anything happened to any of her three babies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Nelson was Kyla's only child! He was her motivation to live!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn took a taxi to Martin Weiss's office building in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Business news online had reported about it, so she hardly needed to look it up. Martin Weiss had also been in Emerald City these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla Corbyn was stopped by the security guards when she reached the building&rsquo;s entrance. When she said she wanted to see Martin Weiss, the security guards kicked her out because they thought she was here to create trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn tried to barge in several times, repeatedly saying, "Let me in, I really have something very important to talk to Martin Weiss about! Let me in!"</p></div>
