        <h1>Chapter 1166</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For example, a well-known female celebrity had once asked Brian to kiss her to fulfill her wish, even if it was just on the cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian did not say yes. He only said lightly, "You're not the one I want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another example was that Brian was good at painting. Besides, it was said that he had a studio full of paintings he had painted, but they were never released to the public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Additionally, Brian never allowed others to call him &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;. The nickname seemed to be his taboo. A female celebrity once tried to get to the top by endearingly calling him &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;, only to be blacklisted until she quit the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace listened to the gossip Lina told her, and unconsciously, they had already driven to the rental house&rsquo;s neighborhood gate. Lina steered the wheel and pressed on the brake to slowly come to a stop, but the brake strangely did not seem to work. The car would not stop at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's face instantly turned pale as she stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sitting in the passenger seat, Grace sensed something was wrong with her best friend and asked hurriedly, "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The brake isn't working!" said Lina. All had been well on the way, but it suddenly stopped working now! The car was moving even faster. Once the car increased its speed even more later, it was just...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina dared not imagine it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace... I... I'll try my best to drive to an empty spot. Find a chance to jump out of the car!" Lina said dryly. The car was out of control, but the steering wheel was not broken. If she drove the car to a quiet place and let Grace jump out of it, it should not be a big problem even if there were some injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace heard this, she suddenly understood Lina's plan. "If I jump out of the car, what about you? Are you going to stay in the car?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Someone has to steer the car. You jump first. I'll look for a chance to jump out of the car after you jump!" said Lina after taking a deep breath. It was the best solution her mind could think of in a short time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she began to drive in the direction where there were fewer people and less traffic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not usually calm and composed. She would have been flustered if she had faced this alone, but this time, she was unusually clear-headed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even now, her heart was pounding heavily like it was going to jump out of her throat, but she kept driving steadily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina thought it was because Grace was here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was right beside her, so she wanted Grace to be safe no matter what! She could not let anything happen to Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The wish was so strong that it overpowered her panic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If we're going to jump, we'll jump together!" Grace's voice rang. The later they jumped out of the car, the more dangerous it would be!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if the steering wheel..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Lina could finish, Grace said, "Then we'll take a bet. Even if no one's steering the car, the direction won't go too far off in a short period. I can't trust leaving you alone in the car!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Lina glared at her best friend, her nose feeling sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Lina, I had a car accident and saw someone die in front of my eyes. I don't want to go through that again. Not to mention that person being you! If you continue to dawdle, then the car's going to get faster and faster. We'll get badly hurt when we jump later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina instantly made up her mind and said, "Okay, let's do it. Let's try our best anyway!"</p></div>
