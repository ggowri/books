        <h1>Chapter 1589</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason did not answer. His dark eyes just stared at the person in front of him. There was a layer of sweat on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How much did I love her back then? Why was I so distressed after mistakenly thinking she had died?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Previously, the broken memories that surfaced in his mind made him feel like an onlooker watching something that had happened. This time, it felt like a personal experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He felt the pain of his old self so clearly that he almost broke down with despair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay?" His silence made Grace frown. She even raised her hand and waved it before his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, her hand was instantly in his grip. His palm was full of the warmth of her hand. She was alive, not just ashes in a cold urn like in his memory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason suddenly leaned over and hugged Grace. "Tell me, how much did I love you before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He whispered with an eagerness in his voice that he had never heard before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. She did not understand why he was suddenly asking that but replied, "You loved me very much. You could give anything for me, including your own life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she had not recovered her memories from when she fell off the cliff, she could imagine what it was like just from Terrence's description. She knew how much the man in front of her loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason buried his face in Grace's neck. He took in her scent, reassuring himself that she was indeed in his arms. It seemed like the only way to make him feel safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then you mustn't die before me!" he uttered the words almost with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the car arrived at Reed Residence, Jason almost hurriedly dragged Grace back into the bedroom. He pressed her onto the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, wait. I... I still have my makeup on. I'm still wearing a gown and jewelry&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had not finished when he interrupted, "I'll do it..." he said as he lifted his hand, taking off her gown and throwing it onto the floor. He took off the ruby necklace and laid it on the bedside table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He wanted her so badly right now. An indescribable fear and uneasiness made him long for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His kisses rained down on her. She could feel his urgency.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, what happened? Is your headache&hellip; Are you really okay? Do you need a doctor?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I just want you now... Grace, I want you and I want you to want me..." he said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's face turned a little red, but she still replied, "Okay, I want you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This time, she raised her hands and removed the clothes on his body...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The intimacy was memorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, is what Brian just said true? You... knew who the perpetrator was but didn&rsquo;t do anything for the benefit of the company?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why you? Why does it have to be you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What do I do? Even if... I can forgive you, my body just can't seem to... accept you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She leaned over the sink, throwing up so hard that her face was pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stood outside the bathroom, only finding his breathing becoming stifled as though he was in an ice cave. His heart continued to sink...</p></div>
