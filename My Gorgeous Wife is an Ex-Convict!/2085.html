        <h1>Chapter 2083</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The baby's not kicking so much anymore. They're behaving just the same as usual," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Huh? They're back to normal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, the little boy just put his hand on my belly, and I..." When Lina spoke, she looked toward where the little boy was standing but found that the little boy and the middle-aged man had disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said to Lina, "Let's get in the car first. We&rsquo;ll go to the hospital and have it checked anyway. After all, it's unusual for the baby to kick intensely all of a sudden."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina thought about it and agreed, so she got into the car. Grace then drove to the hospital Lina's obstetric record was registered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was a VIP patient here. She did not need to wait in line after registering. A specialist instantly consulted her. The specialist took it seriously after learning that the baby had been kicking unusually. They immediately heard the baby's heartbeat and arranged for an ultrasound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Kyla waited nervously outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Kyla's expression suddenly changed. She instantly stood up, covered her mouth, and ran toward the hospital&rsquo;s washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Blaargh... Blaargh..." She threw up at the sink for quite some time before she finally stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla gargled her mouth and looked at her pale face in the mirror. 'What's wrong with me? I've thrown up twice in a row today.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she came out of the washroom and returned to the ultrasound waiting area, she saw Grace looking at her anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, what was that just now? Are you okay?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "It's probably just my stomach. I just threw up and am feeling better now. Maybe it was something I ate that&rsquo;s upsetting my stomach. I'll just take two pills for my stomach later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace hesitated a little before asking with hesitation, &ldquo;Kyla, did something... happen between you and Martin Weiss recently?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she went to the store to visit Kyla and Nelson, Mrs. Corbyn had mentioned Martin Weiss visiting Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's expression instantly changed when she heard that. Then, the color in her face suddenly disappeared as if she had recalled something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not help sighing to herself when she saw Kyla's reaction. It seemed that something did happen between Kyla and Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, Kyla must have paled because she had also thought of that possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, we're in the hospital right now. Why don't you... take a blood test?" Grace said euphemistically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks." Kyla shook her head in a fluster. She stumbled a little as if she could not stand on her feet. "Grace, I suddenly feel a little sick. I... I'm gonna go home first. I'm sorry that you have to look after Lina alone. Let... Let me know if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said and almost fled the hospital in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at Kyla's back and understood what she was afraid of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla had been trying to distance herself from Martin Weiss, but if Kyla were pregnant with Martin Weiss's child just as she expected, then... their relationship would probably have to be more chaotic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though Grace wanted to help Kyla, she did not know what to do all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Lina walked out of the ultrasound room. When she did not see Kyla, she asked Grace, "Where's Kyla?"</p></div>
