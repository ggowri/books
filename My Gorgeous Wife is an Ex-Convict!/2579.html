        <h1>Chapter 2577</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her red lips together and felt everyone around them watching them. "Because I want to go to Emerald City to study. I&rsquo;ve given you the answer you want. Can you let go of your hand now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to Emerald City?" George Gregory froze. "What about Simon? Are you going to abandon him too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never wanted to abandon him, and I would take him with me if he agreed, but... would he? Would the Gregory family be willing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory paused. Simon had no idea that Amber Mitchell was his biological mother. Besides, his parents would never agree to it even if Simon wanted to follow Amber Mitchell one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why say more if they wouldn&rsquo;t agree to it?" Amber Mitchell pulled her arm out of George Gregory's hand and left for the airport with her lawyer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a long time before George Gregory came to his senses. He told the driver, "Get the car ready. We&rsquo;re going to the airport."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the airport, it was not difficult to find out which flight Amber Mitchell was taking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Amber Mitchell was waiting in the VIP lounge, George Gregory watched afar from outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always known how straightforward she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People like her could clearly differentiate love from hate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not expect that she would leave Deer City. Even their son... could not make her stay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, what else was there that could keep her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, George Gregory saw Amber Mitchell walk out of the VIP lounge and go to the boarding gate. He only stood behind her and watched her go in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because he knew he could not keep her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he fell on his knees and harmed himself, he could not make her stay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it over for us? Should I accept my fate?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe the best way was to stop loving her. That way, he would stop feeling pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his heart throbbed as if telling him how much he loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amby... What should I do? What should I do to get close to you..." he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no one could give him an answer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could only stare blankly at the plane as it flew past. He watched the distance between them grow farther apart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he would never get anywhere near her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the plane, Amber Mitchell looked at the photo on her phone. It was... a photo of Simon. It was a photo of the little one asleep. She had secretly taken it with her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had asked the doctor, and the doctor said that Simon was recovering well. She was relieved to hear this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The child would have a far better life with the Gregory family than with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the child had no feelings for her. It would be too much for her to force maternal love on him. She would rather let nature take its course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a mother, all she wanted was for her child to be healthy, safe, and happy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Other than that, nothing else mattered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell visited Kyla at the store as soon as she arrived in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was enjoying the sun with her little daughter at the store entrance. She was surprised to see Amber Mitchell. Although Amber Mitchell had said she would come to Emerald City when they spoke on the phone, Kyla did not expect her to come so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really planning on staying in Emerald City?" Kyla asked.</p></div>
