        <h1>Chapter 3965</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay if you don't want to talk now. When you're ready to talk, just tell me. I have plenty of time to listen," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy pursed her lips. After the Schultz family's situation was resolved and Clarissa was imprisoned, she would confess everything to him and beg for his forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if... he didn't want to forgive her at that time, it was what she deserved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just thinking about it, a piercing pain spread in her heart and lingered for a long time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, the news reported that Francis was hospitalized due to worrying about his daughter's situation. However, there was another saying that Francis was attacked. When he was hospitalized, his cheeks were swollen and obviously beaten. It was said that he even lost a few teeth. It was unclear who he had offended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, the latter saying was just a rumor circulating online, and there were no photos or evidence to support it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Clarissa's trial was getting closer and closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy felt more and more nervous as the trial approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she nervous about whether Clarissa would receive a fair trial, or... was she nervous about confessing everything to Mick after Clarissa's case was over?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Clarissa and herself were about to be tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day of the trial, the other party did not show up. Francis unexpectedly did not attend, and Mick accompanied Nancy to the court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Clarissa was brought out by the bailiff, Nancy almost couldn't recognize her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was haggard, her dry hair was tied up with a simple rubber band like straw, and she </span><span>was no longer wearing designer clothes, but only the detention center's uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought that Clarissa, who was once so glamorous, would end up like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In court, Clarissa naturally denied everything and claimed that it was Nancy who intentionally jumped out and hit her car while she was driving, and that she had no intention of committing murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the lawyer that Mick hired was the best criminal defense team in Emerald City, with an unbeatable record.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, they refuted Clarissa's claims one by one, making all of her defenses seem weak and ineffective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final result was as expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was sentenced to 20 years in prison, which meant that her best years would be spent behind bars. By the time she was released, the world outside would be a different place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the police took Clarissa away, she glared at Nancy with resentment and shouted, "Nancy, don't get too cocky. Do you think you've won? You're just a dog who relies on others. In the future, you'll be even more miserable than me. When I get out of prison, I'll still be the Schultz family's princess. I'll make sure to see what kind of person you've become!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were like the most vicious curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy frowned, but before she could say anything, Mick coldly looked at Clarissa and said, "After 20 years, when you're released, the Schultz family may no longer exist."</span></p></div>
