        <h1>Chapter 1349</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, provided that Martin Weiss no longer had feelings for Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he still won't do it, I'll tie him to the operating table even if I have to!" said Grace as she gritted her teeth, looking like she was throwing all caution to the wind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Grace in surprise when he heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought you would stick to the law no matter what and wouldn't do things that go against other people's will," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A burst of embarrassment instantly flashed across her face. 'Gosh, I've forgotten I'm a lawyer!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Perhaps it's because... I think Martin Weiss owes Kyla too much. I think it's just too unfair if Kyla leaves this world just like that!" She paused and said somewhat hesitantly, "If I have to force Martin Weiss when the time comes, will you... help me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A look of conflict appeared on her face. After all, this decision was so different from what she had always pursued and insisted on. However, on the other hand, she did not want Kyla to die just like that and for Nelson to lose his mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled faintly. "Haven't I told you? I'll do whatever you want. No matter what it is, I'll do it as long as you tell me to. I'll go through whatever dangers and difficulties for you. Even if the sky falls, you have me to hold it up for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was the same as always. It was nothing vehement. He spoke softly, but with his usual cold tone. She felt as though there were enthralling musical notes dancing in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But don't you think what I'm asking you to do will get you in trouble?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took her hand and said, "So what? Grace, I promised you I'd be your hand and sword. I would do anything for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt her hand burning faintly as he held it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her hand slowly held his, gently putting his hand in her palm. "Jay, you're not my sword. You're the one I want to spend my life with and the one I want to protect!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body suddenly trembled, and those dark eyes gazed at her. After a good while, he said with a hoarse voice, "You're the only person who can protect me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because only she was his weakness and only she could hurt him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went to see Kyla Corbyn again, Kyla Corbyn was about to go to the hospital for a follow-up and fill her prescription. Grace said to Mrs. Corbyn, "I'll accompany Kyla to the hospital. Aunt, you can rest at home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you're..." Mrs. Corbyn felt awkward. After all, Grace was now pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm doing okay, and I have a driver and a car, so it's convenient for me to send Kyla to and fro," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn thought about it and agreed. She said gratefully, "Thank you, Grace."</p></div>
