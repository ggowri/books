        <h1>Chapter 2909</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned her head and saw that Raymond Bowman had walked up behind her without her noticing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned slightly and turned to leave, but Raymond Bowman grabbed her wrist and said, "Wait."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, what are you doing?" Valda Theller struggled to pull her hand back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But he held on firmly and said, "Valda Theller, I know I no longer have the right to be in front of you, but I really hope you can live well. Have you and Brian Hart...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't need to tell you anything about me and him," she interrupted quickly. "Raymond Bowman, I just want us to keep our distance. I don't want you to disturb my life anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I also hope I can keep my distance from you, but I...I just can't," Raymond Bowman murmured. "These days, all I can think about is you, and I think about what happened at the college and the comic convention. Something must have happened between you and Brian Hart, otherwise, when he came in just now and you looked at each other, you wouldn't have had that expression."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had seen everything just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, Brian Hart was never the right person for you. I know I have missed too much, and I have paid the price for it for so many years. You have always been in my heart, never disappeared. I have always regretted why I did what I did, why I hurt you. If I hadn't done those things back then, the outcome between us would have been completely different. Maybe we would be together happily now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He murmured, his voice full of regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, this time, I will protect you. I won't let you be hurt again. Although I know that some mistakes cannot be made up for, I will be better to you in the future and treat you well for the rest of my life." Raymond Bowman looked at Valda Theller affectionately. "So, give me another chance, okay? I love you, really love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Raymond Bowman in a daze. This man, whom she had once loved, had also hurt her deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, you used to like me, didn't you? Then like me again, please?" He took a step forward, then another...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were almost touching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller...if you're not with Brian Hart anymore, then choose me this time. I won't let you down, and I won't let anyone hurt you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, trying to hug Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But at that moment, Valda Theller raised her hand and pressed it against his chest. She slowly looked up at him and said firmly, "Raymond Bowman, I...did like you before, but now there's nothing left of that liking. Or, if there is anything left, it's just disgust."</p></div>
