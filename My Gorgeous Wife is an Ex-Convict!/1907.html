        <h1>Chapter 1905</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was negligent. Since Katherine Jackson dared to attack Lina once, it was likely that she would do it a second time. Did he not already know how much Grace cared about Lina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, after Katherine Jackson harmed Lina, Grace helped his mother and Old Lawyer Watts escape Emerald City. He was so furious that he completely forgot about Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Nothing can happen to Grace. If something does happen to her...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's breathing intensified. If anyone were near him, they would have seen how ghastly his expression was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He thought he could stop loving her so much, but nothing beat her safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace saw Lina, she learned that her best friend got into the car with Katherine Jackson because Katherine Jackson had threatened her best friend with Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What Katherine Jackson said to Lina at the time was... "If you don't get in the car with me, I can't guarantee what's going to happen to your mother who's in the washroom. If you yell or resist, I'm going to press the button to detonate the bomb. The washroom she&rsquo;s in will blow up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was not sure if what Katherine Jackson said was true, but Katherine Jackson did not give her any time to delay. If she did not leave with her within a minute, then she would press the bomb trigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Afraid to risk her mother's life, she could only leave with Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to secretly call the police in the car, but Katherine Jackson took her phone and forced her to lie to her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, I'm sorry," said Lina. She did not expect to involve her best friend in this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you okay? Did she hurt you?" Grace cared more about her best friend's safety than her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson had tied up Lina's hands and feet. Katherine Jackson also had several tall, burly men around who looked so mean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm fine," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Fine?" Katherine Jackson chuckled with a face full of sarcasm. "You may be fine now, but something will happen to you in a moment. Lina, you don't think I brought you here just to show you the view, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said sternly, "Katherine Jackson, what are you up to?" Katherine Jackson had called her phone. She made her get into an unfamiliar car and forced her to call her personnel to call off the search for Lina, threatening her with Lina's safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jay would know what to do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson said, "Of course, I want to get justice for myself. Grace, I didn't want to do anything to you, but you sent people to look for Lina. Hence, I can only make you suffer with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The hatred in Katherine Jackson's eyes was uncontrollable at the mention of Lina</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If it were not for Lina, there was no way Hadwin Stephenson would have been so ruthless with her! She even thought she could one day revive the Jackson family after she lifted Hadwin Stephenson's blood curse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, who would have expected Hadwin Stephenson to spare her no chance to turn their fate. Even though he bought part of the Jackson family's properties at a good price as per their agreement, he drove the Jackson family into a corner in other ways.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had angrily gone looking for Hadwin Stephenson before.</p></div>
