        <h1>Chapter 4149 What Kind of Return?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Is it a charm with a white bead hanging from it?" Kit asked, relying on his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes," Tina replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Well, I received it." However, now he was unsure of where exactly the charm was, and whether it had been sold along with the other items during the charity sale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "That's great, I didn't expect you to still remember that charm," Tina said, smiling with satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This is probably the satisfaction of an idol remembering a gift given by a fan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit looked at Tina's smile. Why was she able to show such a smile just for receiving a gift from him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As if he was important to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she already has another man by her side, doesn't she?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Why does she still come and provoke him like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So, your concern has reached the point where you need to send me resources?" Kit's voice suddenly rose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was taken aback, then realized what he meant, "You know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Did you give me resources but didn't want me to know?" he asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although Tina is usually easygoing, it doesn't mean she doesn't pick up on cues, especially at this moment when Kit's words seemed to contain some sarcasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Indeed, the resources were entrusted to me by my parents. My intention was for you to not make decisions regarding resources that you would regret in the future. Furthermore, I believe in your potential. As long as you are given an opportunity, I believe you have the ability to obtain better resources based on your own skills." Tina straightforwardly explained the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want any misunderstandings between her and Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Kit suddenly burst into laughter, his laughter coming through his mask. "So, you really are the heiress of the White Maple Group. Resources of this level that others can't even beg for, you can easily give to me with just a few words. So, what do you want me to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he took off his glasses and mask, revealing his handsome face. "What do you want from me? Do you like my face or my body? With such valuable resources, even if you ask me to sleep with you, I shouldn't refuse, right? Or perhaps, you want to have a secret affair behind your fianc&eacute;'s back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While speaking, he approached Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked at Kit in shock, as if she were looking at a stranger. "What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You give me resources because you like me, right? So, what do you want me to do? Since the resources are so valuable, anything should be possible." He leaned closer to her, his breath brushing against her cheek, like an invisible provocation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the matter? Can't speak? Or do you want me to be more proactive?" As he spoke, his fingers brushed against her soft lips, and then his lips were about to touch hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Smack!" A crisp and loud slap interrupted his actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina forcefully pushed Kit away, glaring at him. A palm print appeared on his handsome cheek, the result of her slap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was well aware of how important his idol face was. Even if she wanted to hit him, she shouldn't have hit his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she didn't regret what she had done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why is it that giving you resources automatically means I want to do such things with you? Do you think your success until now is solely because of your body? Yes, you are an idol, and perhaps many fans like you because of your body and appearance, but I believe there are more fans who like your singing talent, your hard work, and your character!" Tina said indignantly.</p></div>
