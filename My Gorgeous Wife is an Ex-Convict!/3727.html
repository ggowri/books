        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he made a sound, otherwise she might have done something more exaggerated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he looked like he was about to be ravished! To outsiders, her behavior probably looked like that of an impatient woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, she couldn't help but cry out in her heart, "I'm sorry, I just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why apologize? I wanted you to do it," Mason said, his usually indifferent eyes now shining with a faint light, even his breathing seemed to be slightly labored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um...yeah..." Veronica stuttered, looking embarrassed. "Did you...feel disgusted by what I did earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I felt disgusted, do you think you'd still be sitting on top of me?" he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt even more embarrassed, realizing their current position was quite suggestive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to get off him, but he pulled her back down. She lost her balance and ended </span><span>up back on top of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what about you? Have you come to a conclusion?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" She didn't understand at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of feelings do you have for me?" he clarified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell silent, his handsome face seemed to be affecting her ability to think clearly. She struggled to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head away, not wanting to look at him. "At least it's not the kind of feelings you have for a younger brother," she finally said. She didn't notice the slight flicker in his eyes when she said that, as if he had some kind of unspoken feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So we can do this often from now on," he suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?!" Veronica was shocked and turned to look at him in disbelief. "You...you want me to do this kind of thing with you often?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't have heard him correctly, could she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm-hmm," he replied. "Since we don't have any feelings of disgust towards each other and it's not like we have a brother-sister relationship, why not do this often? We're both adults now, and if we want to take it further, we can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face turned bright red. Did he mean having sex?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he know that his serious expression and suggestive words were the most tempting and dangerous thing about him?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps you don't want to try more with me? Maybe if we try more, you can understand your feelings towards me better." He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remained silent. Did they really need to do more intimate things? But strangely, when he suggested it, she didn't feel repulsed. In fact...she felt happy?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was happening to her? Veronica suddenly felt like she didn't even understand herself. She was actually looking forward to having more physical contact with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But wasn't she the one who, after he confessed his feelings, was most afraid of being too physically intimate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few years had passed, but her mindset had changed so much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't want to?" Mason's voice rang out.</span></p></div>
