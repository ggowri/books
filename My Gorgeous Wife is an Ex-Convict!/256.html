        <h1>Chapter 255</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he refused to listen. Instead, he pulled her hand closer and looked down at the faint bruising on the back of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he brought the back of her hand close to his lips and gave it a gentle puff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gasped, only to see Jason blowing it seriously with his head low.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It won't hurt so much after I blow it," he muttered. Then, he gently rubbed the bruise on the back of her hand with his fingertips, blowing and rubbing with a focused gaze. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as though her heart was beating very violently at the moment, and her throat seemed to be so jammed that she could not say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was Jason who did this, she would think she had a caring brother, but it was Jason... She was overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Jason's bodyguard who was standing behind him, his eyes widened at the sight of this. When&hellip; had he ever seen Young Master Reed treat a woman like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it would not be long before the entire Emerald City would know her name!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Feeling any better?" A gentle magnetic voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... better," Grace said, trying to withdraw her hand for the third time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his fingers were firmly around her wrist. He carefully avoided the bruise on the back of her hand. "Be good if you know it hurts, or I'll hurt you again if I'm not careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face flushed a little. His voice sounded as though it carried some ambiguous feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she could only be led by him to his Bentley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver opened the door respectfully, and Jason and Grace got on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's still time today. We don't need to go back so early. Is there any place you want to see?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. There was nowhere she would want to go with him by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let's find a place nearby. By the way, I remember when Sis used to take me to those night markets and malls." Jason chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That was one of the most idiotic things she had ever done!' Grace said to herself. She thought about the time when she scrimped and saved to buy clothes and a mobile phone for him. As it turned out, he was not lacking these at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she a joke to him at the time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason asked his driver to park in front of a nearby shopping mall that Grace recognized as the one they had visited together before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he said he had just gotten his paycheck. Then, they found a restaurant in the mall and went in for a meal. She thought of helping him to save as much money as possible, but now that she thought about it, it was unnecessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, Jason was taking her to the same restaurant again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to go in and get something to eat?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly and said, "Alright!" He went in first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They found a place to sit, and when the waiter handed over the menu, Grace took it and ordered a variety of expensive dishes on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The waiter quickly recorded all the dishes. Even the waiter could not help but frown. This... This was too much. These two people could not possibly finish all this food. Were they here to make trouble?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, on the other hand, smirked as he watched Grace ordering dishes. He was looking at her with a fondness in his eyes that he did not even know existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ordered more than 20 dishes at one go. When she looked up, she saw Jason's smiling and amorous eyes.</p></div>
