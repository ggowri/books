        <h1>Chapter 2908</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If someone didn't know his identity, they might think he was a big star from the show!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the director, producer, and a large group of crew members rushed up to Brian Hart as soon as they saw him, their faces filled with enthusiasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Hart, you're here! We thought you weren't coming." The producer greeted her warmly. They had sent an invitation, but there was no response from Mr. Hart's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, they assumed that Mr. Hart had refused to attend the wrap party on the second floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now that Mr. Hart had come, it was a pleasant surprise. After all, Mr. Hart's personal presence showed his importance to the show. It might even make things easier for publicity and such.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And those actors, especially the female ones, were eager to get close to Brian Hart. If they could catch his eye, they would be on the fast track to success in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian Hart didn't pay much attention to their enthusiasm. He just looked up and scanned the banquet hall, as if searching for something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, his gaze stopped at Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh my god, Brian Hart is looking over here!" The gossip screenwriter exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The others at the table noticed the situation too and couldn't help but look at Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The screenwriter's expression became somewhat unnatural. It was obvious that Brian Hart was looking at Valda Theller. She had just implied that Brian Hart wouldn't be interested in her, and now it was like a slap in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's gaze met Brian Hart's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They used to be close, but now they were separated by so many people, like an insurmountable gap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Or perhaps it should be said that the distance between them was always so far. It was just an illusion that they were once close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The producer noticed Brian Hart's gaze on Valda Theller's table and suggested, "Mr. Hart, would you like Miss Theller to switch tables and sit at yours later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart took a while to respond before saying, "No need." Then he lifted his foot and walked towards another table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, Brian Hart didn't come over to say hello. It seems like there's really nothing between him and Valda Theller." The screenwriter deliberately said this to save face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller didn't say anything and lowered her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland whispered, "If you feel uncomfortable, we can find an excuse to leave early."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda Theller replied softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the wrap party, the focus was supposed to be on the lead actors, but now it had shifted to Brian Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After eating a few bites of food, Valda Theller excused herself to go to the restroom and walked out of the hall. But instead of going to the restroom, she walked to the floor-to-ceiling window at the end of the corridor and looked at the stars outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The night was beautiful, but her mood was heavy, making it hard for her to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was wrong with her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she wanted to distance herself from Brian Hart, then him not coming over to say hello was the best thing that could happen. That way, everyone would think there was nothing between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But...her heart still ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller, you're so melodramatic! She mocked herself in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice sounded in her ear, "Valda Theller."</p></div>
