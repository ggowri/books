        <h1>Chapter 2389</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Grace gave Kyla some of the information she found about Amber Mitchell. It was mainly about Amber Mitchell and George Gregory's relationship. George Gregory fell in love with Amber Mitchell at first sight and courted her for a year. Then, they started dating, but George Gregory decided to break off the engagement on the eve of the wedding. One of George Gregory's best friends and Amber Mitchell got into an accident. They were in the same car. One could say that the man died protecting Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After that, Amber Mitchell became mentally ill and was sent to a mental hospital. Later, George Gregory married Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the information in her hands, Kyla froze. "Why did the name Herman Moss never appear when we were investigating previously?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it seemed that Herman Moss had a complicated relationship with Amber Mitchell and George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Moss, Gregory, and Mitchell families are affluent families in Deer City. It&rsquo;d be a scandal to let the public know that the eldest heir of the Moss family die to protect his best friend's fianc&eacute;e. Besides, there was a rumor before the accident that something was going on between Amber Mitchell and Herman Moss, so the three families worked together to suppress the news. This information is only stated in police files. No one else knows that the person in the car with Herman Moss at the time was Amber Mitchell!" Grace explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does Amber Mitchell's hospitalization have anything to do with the Moss family?" Kyla asked as things seemed more complicated than she had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know. I wonder what role George Gregory played in all this." Grace pondered and said, "You can say that Amber Mitchell's existence became a stain on the Mitchell, Gregory, and Moss families after the accident. Making Amber Mitchell 'disappear' from the public eye became the best choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla thought that she was&hellip; getting closer and closer to the mystery that shrouded this whole incident. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell must have loved George Gregory," Kyla said abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know about it? "Grace asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head. "I didn't know his name before this, but I knew she had someone she loved. She said she would marry him, be a mother, and have his children. According to the timeline, that person is probably George Gregory."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If George Gregory was involved in sending Amber Mitchell to a mental hospital, how big would the blow be to Amber Mitchell? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was sent to a mental hospital by the person she loved the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how she was sent to prison by Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I... want to meet George Gregory, the man Amber Mitchell was in love with, and find out if George Gregory thinks Amber Mitchell is really mentally ill."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I go with you?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Kyla could speak, Martin Weiss had returned to the room. He walked over and said, "I'll go with her. I'll say it's for business. At least the reason is more legitimate that way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and said, "Yes, it's also less likely to raise suspicions."</p></div>
