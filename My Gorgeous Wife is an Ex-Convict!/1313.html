        <h1>Chapter 1312</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're doing okay so far, but you need to get some progesterone shots. You need one every day. I'll prescribe you for one week to see how it goes and we can adjust it later on. The needle will be pierced into the belly, so it's going to hurt a lot more than when you get a jab on your arm or hip. You'll need to be mentally prepared," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Grace readily replied. As long as her children could come into the world safely, she could endure any pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was not nervous when she saw the slender needle going into her slightly protruding belly. Jason was instead the nervous one and grabbed the hand of the nurse giving the injection. "Is this needle going in there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ye-Yes," the nurse stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it okay to stab her belly with such a long needle?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse was rendered speechless. 'Aren't all needles the same length?' The nurse looked puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the contrary, Grace said in a relaxed tone, "The doctor and nurse won't be mistaken, Jay. Don't worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason finally let go of the nurse's hand, but his expression was still nervous. He was tense, and his eyes were glaring right at the needle in the nurse's hand. The nurse felt stiff and did not know how to inject all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, why don't you go outside and wait for me? The nurse will get nervous if you stare at her like that," Grace said to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll stay here. At most... I won't watch her inject you," Jason said and moved his gaze to Grace's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the nurse breathed a sigh of relief and quickly pierced the needle into Grace's belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned and subconsciously clenched her teeth as soon as the needle pierced her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An injection in the belly did hurt more, but... it was nothing to her. After all, after experiencing three years in prison, her pain tolerance was pretty good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the injection, Jason immediately asked nervously, "Was it painful?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. Just a little more painful than ordinary injections," Grace smiled and said casually, "I'm going to keep getting this injection for a while. If you keep getting so nervous every time, I'm afraid you'll be so nervous that you'll end up in hospital before the babies are born."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his head and looked at the spot on her belly where she had just been pierced with a needle. "I worry about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know." She smiled gently and straightened her clothes. "Alright, it's just an injection. It's nothing. You needn't be so nervous. The class is starting soon, so let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They went to the room where the hospital's pregnancy classes were held. It was a large conference room with a semi-circular design, and the center of the semi-circular room was a projection screen and a lecturing platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was also a space in front of the platform where some props were placed while several rows of seats surrounded the lecturing platform in a circle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a cursory glance at the room, which could hold hundreds of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hospital Jason had chosen for her was a renowned private maternity hospital in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to the expensive fees, most of the people who came here were from well-off families in Emerald City. It naturally included some of Emerald City's socialites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, when an heir from a company in Emerald City accompanied his wife to the class, he suddenly felt as though he was struck by thunder when he saw Jason who was already sitting in a seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on? Is that... Master Reed?'</p></div>
