        <h1>Chapter 3933</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who would have thought that the former mistress who was kicked out by the Schultz family would be worshipped by the Reed family's eldest son after her death?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Mick placed the incense in the censer, Nancy suddenly said, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank me for what?" he turned to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you for being willing to pay respects to my mother. I am not the only one who came to worship her today. My mother liked lively occasions, so having one more person here today would make her happy even in the afterlife," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a pause, Nancy added, "And thank you for helping me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you referring to me standing up for you today?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not only that," she said, "Clarissa came to me today to vent her anger because you warned the Schultz family not to bother me. She was upset, so she came to me to let it out. But Mr. Reed, you don't have to worry. Although Clarissa misunderstood our relationship today, she will realize in a few days that there is nothing between us, so there shouldn't be any strange rumors spreading."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gave her a strange glance. "Why should I worry if she misunderstands, and what strange rumors are you talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy said with a hint of embarrassment, "I thought...you wouldn't like it if people misunderstood that you have some kind of relationship with a woman. I just thought that when she comes to her senses and realizes that there is nothing between us, she won't go around spreading rumors."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if she comes to you to vent her anger again?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I will find a way to fight back and not let her have her way," Nancy said. Her voice became a little uneasy as she continued, "Of course, I won't use your name to say anything nonsense next time. I promise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick frowned slightly, feeling that her last sentence was a bit harsh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially the way she kept calling him "Mr. Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to distance yourself from me?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was taken aback. This question sounded strange. And the way he said it...it seemed like he was a little angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A certain possibility that had flashed through her mind before began to resurface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you...not want to distance yourself from me?" Nancy looked straight at the man in front of her and asked bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick remained silent. Indeed, he didn't seem to like the idea of her distancing herself from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was like...she was special.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when did this special feeling begin?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you help me just out of kindness, or because you like me?" Nancy gathered her courage and asked even more boldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I like you?" Mick asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just think there's a possibility," Nancy replied, trying to sound calm. Only she knew how nervous she was at this moment, her hands hanging at her sides slowly starting to sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick chuckled. Did he like the woman in front of him? Although he did treat her differently, was it really that simple to have such feelings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, this woman in front of him had an ordinary appearance. The only thing special about her was perhaps the stubbornness and endurance in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It left a deep impression on him.</p></div>
