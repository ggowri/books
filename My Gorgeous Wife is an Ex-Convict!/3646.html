        <h1>Chapter 3644</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He despised the fact that he had the blood of the Atkinson family flowing through his veins. If possible, he wished that part of his blood could disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't like them, then just avoid them in the future. Just because there's a blood relation doesn't mean they're family!" Jasper said, raising his hand to embrace William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wanting to comfort him, wanting to alleviate his pain, she knew that his pain would make her feel the same. Was it because she liked him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned his head on her shoulder, as if this slender body of hers had become the support he needed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her support, he wouldn't collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know what's even more ridiculous? Their so-called longing for me, their so-called desire for my forgiveness, is just a hope for them to die and find peace. They're getting old and don't want any regrets, so they come to me to complete this regret," he murmured, his tone full of self-mockery. "But if back then, the Reed family hadn't adopted me, if I weren't William now, but still Randall, they wouldn't have come looking for me in the first place, let alone ask for my forgiveness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But whether you're Randall or William, to me, you're still William," Jasper said. "Tell me, what can I do to make you feel less sad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, she wouldn't care if he was Randall or William. When they were young, she was the one who truly pulled him out of the abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those so-called relatives, whether it was Lily, Harold, or Camelia, were only pushing him further into the abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of these three people, William suddenly pushed Jasper away, stumbled back a few steps, then bent over and started retching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling of disgust once again filled his entire body, making him extremely uncomfortable, until a hand gently stroked his back and her voice sounded in his ear, "What's wrong with you? Is your stomach upset?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-nothing, just don't get too close to me, in case I accidentally throw up on you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's okay!" she interrupted him, "Even if you do throw up on me, I wouldn't mind." As she spoke, her hand continued to stroke his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, that uncomfortable feeling finally faded a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked up at Jasper standing next to her, moonlight shining on her, accentuating her delicate features even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was beautiful, although there were other beautiful women in this world, only she could capture his full attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, I'm feeling much better now," he straightened up and said, "It's already late, you should go inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment, "Why don't you just stay here overnight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was taken aback, "You want me to stay here overnight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm," she nodded, "You're going back to your villa anyway, and you'll be alone. It's better to stay here overnight, you can sleep in the guest room. Besides, didn't you used to stay here overnight often before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although that is true, but...</span></p></div>
