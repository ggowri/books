        <h1>Chapter 3075</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian trembled and held Valda even tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not you who should apologize, it's me. I couldn't find you and I put you in danger!" Brian murmured, and after a while, he finally let go of her and looked at Valda carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers, slightly trembling, touched her face, her eyebrows, and then her hair. "Your hair... it's shorter now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because short hair... is easier to manage," Valda bit her lip and said. At that time, Lisa took care of her very hard, and her long hair became a burden. Cutting it short was the most convenient option.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze slowly moved downwards, and suddenly his pupils shrank as he stared at the crutch under her armpit. "What's wrong? Are you injured?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's body stiffened and instinctively recoiled, trying to step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, because Brian had his arm around her waist, she couldn't even move away even if she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's...it's nothing..." she said in a fluster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take a look." He looked worried and anxious as he immediately crouched down and tried to lift Valda's long skirt to take a look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Valda stumbled backwards a few steps and said, "Don't look, there's...nothing worth seeing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, let me have a look. I want to know how your injury is doing!" Brian said anxiously. "Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you. I just want to take a look. If your injury hasn't been treated properly, then I'll take you to the hospital right away for further treatment..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He approached her again as he spoke, wanting to pull up her skirt to get a better look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda, however, wanted to avoid it even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, please... don't look, don't look at my legs, okay?" Valda stuttered nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But the more she acted this way, the more it made him worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Valda's foot slipped and she fell backwards, dropping her cane to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was about to fall, Brian quickly stepped forward and caught Valda, saying "Be careful." He then picked her up and gently placed her on the nearby sofa, telling her to sit down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then he knelt down in front of her, with a gentle and cautious look in his eyes, and said, "Valda, let me see your injury. If I don't see it, I won't be able to rest easy. It's been a year, and you finally appear in front of me, but you still have injuries on your body. How could I not look at your injury?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, he didn't even ask why she came back or why she didn't come to see him. He wondered why he had to find out about her return from Camille, and if Camille hadn't mentioned it today, would he have had to wait even longer to find out?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kept all these questions to himself at the moment, and only wanted to know how serious her injury was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda tightly bites her lower lip, and her hands hanging by her side grip the hem of her skirt tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her legs...often she didn't even want to look at them herself, feeling that they were so ugly...and now, this ugly part of her was going to be seen. Seen by the man she cared about the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But... sooner or later, he will see it, won't he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, it's just a little early. Valda kept repeating to herself in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, Brian lifted up her long skirt. She didn't resist anymore, but instead stiffened her body and let him pull up her skirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He saw a slightly deformed leg that looked noticeably different from a normal leg, and even had a gruesome scar on it.</p></div>
