        <h1>Chapter 4391: Chasing Stars</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley didn't expect the conversation to turn to him. He couldn't help but laugh and cry as he pinched the little one's cheeks, "Do you even know what you're talking about?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This little rascal, he sold out his aunt so easily!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you not like Uncle Elledge, Aunt Harley?" The little one blinked those innocent eyes at Harley, "But didn't you also say that Uncle Elledge looks good when he's acting in sad scenes?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley felt a wave of embarrassment. This little guy, when it came to selling her out, he sure was straightforward!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cough, cough..." Harley looked up, his gaze landing on Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Calvert was clearly more embarrassed than she was. His handsome and aloof face was almost embarrassingly red.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Uncle Elledge, you need to be careful. Aunt Harley is planning to tease you. She even said before that seeing you cry makes her want to make you cry even harder! She also mentioned that some people can't help but tease the ones they like." The little one continued to tattle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn!" Harley immediately covered the little guy's mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea before, turns out this kid has such a big mouth!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Harley had dropped Quinn back off at the Hunter family's place, he felt completely drained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, this little guy who seems so innocent and cute is acting like a little devil on this journey. He keeps repeating everything she said when they were watching TV shows </span><span>together, and</span><span> dumps it all on Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley felt like he had lost all his dignity today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing that comforted her was that Calvert seemed even more embarrassed and awkward than she was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at the Hunter family's place, Quinn insisted on inviting Calvert into her home as a guest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert followed Quinn and Harley into the Hunter family home, where he met the master and mistress of the house, </span><span>Chandler</span><span> and Tina.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert had indeed heard of these two. After all, the wedding of the Hunter family and the Stephenson family had caused quite a stir in Emerald City. Moreover, due to an unexpected incident at the wedding, Tina went missing. The city-wide search for Tina had been trending for quite some time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Calvert didn't care about this news at the time, he had heard others discussing it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's been talking about Chandler's deep affection for Tina. They even said that Chandler nearly went crazy during the time he was searching for Tina.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Tina doesn't come back, Chandler might really go crazy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loving someone, loving them so madly, what does it feel like? He wasn't sure. But now, he understands what it feels like to love someone, to love them with such restraint and patience.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler, as usual, was aloof towards strangers. On the other hand, Tina was very enthusiastic. She greeted Calvert warmly, even asking for his autograph. She even went so far as to pull Calvert in for a photo together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Quinn didn't want to be left out. He also pestered Calvert for a photo together, and for a hug.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the scene turned into the mother and daughter both vying for Calvert's attention. Although Calvert was a bit flustered, he still cooperated with the two of them quite well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler wore a stern expression, turning to Harley beside him, he said, "Why did you bring him here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These mother and daughter are now fans of Calvert. Their aesthetic tastes are surprisingly in sync when it comes to Calvert. So much so, that Chandler is very familiar with some of Calvert's gossip!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was just relieved that Calvert wasn't a good singer and didn't hold any concerts. Otherwise, he feared he might have to buy glow sticks and follow the mother-daughter duo into the venue, waving those glow sticks around!</span></p></div>
