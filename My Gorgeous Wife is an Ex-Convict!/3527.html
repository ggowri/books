        <h1>Chapter 3525</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But hypnosis doesn't necessarily mean forgetting. There's another kind where you can remember everything, but... that feeling can be erased," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stared at him in shock. Erased... what does that mean? "What do you mean by erased... I don't understand," she said nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Erased means that everything that happened between you and me is like a movie that I watched as a bystander. And now that the movie is over, there's nothing left," Mason explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Movie? To you now, is everything between us just like a movie?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, just like a movie," he replied, looking at her with such coldness in his eyes. This kind of gaze was just like how he usually looked at his classmates in class. She used to think that he would never look at her with such eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, reality had slapped her hard in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you joking with me? How...how could there be such hypnosis? Are you still angry because of my previous misunderstanding?" she asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his expression remained calm, so calm that it made her extremely uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You know, I never joke around. I didn't before, and I won't in the future. During my time abroad, I voluntarily underwent hypnosis," Mason said. "Veronica, as I've said before, I won't call you Veronica anymore. So, you don't have to treat me like a little brother anymore. If there's no need for us to meet again in the future, you can go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, he turned around and started to head back the way he came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She watched his gradually receding figure and suddenly took a step forward, quickly running towards him. She reached out and stopped him in his tracks. "Mason, do you really not care about our relationship of so many years?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't care," was his response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hand finally fell weakly to her side, while he continued walking forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She forced a bitter smile, never imagining that one day she and he would come to this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hypnotized his feelings for her, their past was just a movie to him, and now that the movie is over, they should naturally go their separate ways.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this their ending?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just now, she even wanted to blurt out that she could try not only treating him as a younger brother, but also try to see if she could fall in love with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the end, she didn't have the chance to say these words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, even if she were to speak up, it would only bring shame upon herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica returned to the Barlow family in a daze, only to face the repeated questioning of her father and stepmother. "What did you say to Mason when you went to the Reed family? Will Lionel be found guilty in the final trial?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Say something! Why are you just standing there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her father and stepmother's questions kept ringing in her ears, but she could barely hear them. All she could think about was Mason's cold gaze flashing through her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was all the affection they had shared in the past now only left in her heart alone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does it no longer hold any meaning for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What's even more ironic is that he willingly underwent hypnosis. At that time, he must have been in pain to choose such a method.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt as if a piece of her heart had been hollowed out. Something was lost, and she couldn't get it back no matter how hard she tried!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, she really lost Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She lost her closest family member!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the next few days of the trial, Mason did not appear again, and although Veronica showed up, she looked very haggard and even spoke less, which made Jasper more worried.</p></div>
