        <h1>Chapter 2772</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was Mrs. Weiss's voice that came from the phone when she picked it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this Kyla?" Mrs. Weiss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes..." Kyla wondered why Mrs. Weiss called her out of the blue. She should be disgusted with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I know I wasn't very nice to you, but Martin doesn't want to divorce you nor explain anything to the outside world. Weiss Group's stock price is also fluctuating. Our rival is deliberately suppressing Weiss Group's stock price to buy more shares. It&rsquo;ll be bad for the company if this goes on," said Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together. "I've already signed the divorce papers, and they're with Martin Weiss. He can go through the divorce formalities any time he wants. If he refuses to do so, I'm afraid I can't go through the divorce formalities alone either. Aunt, if you want us to get divorced as soon as possible, you should be calling him, not me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's tone was indifferent and polite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss paused. "I... I don't want you to get divorced as soon as possible. I hope you can be lovey-dovey with Martin in front of the media, which will help stabilize Weiss Group's stock price. Besides that..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss continued speaking, and Kyla's expression changed as she went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you hope that Martin Weiss and I will be a loving couple in front of the media for now and we&rsquo;ll talk about the divorce after this is over?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, you can let us know if you have anything you want. The Weiss family will try our best to give it to you," said Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly. 'Am I only a tool to Mrs. Weiss? She can use me when she needs me and throw me away when she doesn't.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And this time, I'm destined to be thrown away again after being used.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this Martin Weiss's idea?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss said, "Yes, it's Martin's idea. Martin almost lost his life for you. We only need you to do such simple things. You won't say no, will you? Besides, Nelson and Trista can inherit a large family fortune if Weiss Group does well. It's good for everyone if the Weiss family doesn't collapse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent for a long time before saying, "Okay, I&rsquo;ll do as you say."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other end of the line, Mrs. Weiss was relieved. "Okay, I'll get back to you. I hope you keep your word."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call ended, Kyla looked at her phone and smiled bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not care whether her two children would get the Weiss family's fortune. She only hoped they could grow up happily and Martin Weiss could be all right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they were destined to separate, she still wanted him to be okay for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she would consider it paying him back for saving her life. She was willing to do it if it would be good for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she thought they would not have anything to do with each other except for their relation to the kids after she signed the divorce papers.</p></div>
