        <h1>Chapter 1406</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss stared at his laptop screen. There was shock, bewilderment, fear, and even an extremely contradicting look of struggle and regret in his eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The blood running all over his body seemed to be going against the current. Pain engulfed him wherever his blood flowed in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All he had was these two audio files and no other evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he already had the answer in his heart. He knew who had really saved him back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why... Why am I only hearing these phone recordings now? Why did I believe Paisley Daniels without a doubt when she appeared in front of me and said she donated the bone marrow?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I didn't even do some basic research!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What Kyla Corbyn had said to him in the car once again flashed across his head...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Would you believe me if I said she wasn't the one who saved you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">How had he answered back then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had said she was slandering Paisley Daniels and trying to sow discord between him and Paisley Daniels! He also said... "If it wasn't Paisley who saved me, could it have been you then? I've sworn that I'll protect her, love her, and be loyal to her for as long as I live. You can forget about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He even dragged her to the Daniels family where he made her kneel and grovel!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss raised his hand and immediately slapped himself at the thought of this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, no matter how hard he hit himself, his face seemed to feel no pain. It was the pangs of pain in his heart that were so intense that he could not breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Haha... Haha..." He burst into laughter, tears welling up in his scarlet eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What on earth have I done?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why didn't I trust her one bit? It was probably her last struggle when she told me in the car that it wasn't Paisley Daniels who saved me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'However, I completely shattered her last hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If I had trusted her just a little bit, she wouldn't have lost her dignity and been humiliated in front of the Daniels family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I even ordered the people to humiliate her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Haha... Hahaha..." Martin Weiss's laughter became even more desolate. He slapped his cheeks over and over again as if this was the only way to vent his pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had once laughed like that before him, and he had only been disgusted, wondering why she was laughing so insanely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, only now did he realize that she had laughed like that because there was too much pain in her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Nelson and Mrs. Corbyn were by Kyla Corbyn's side when she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mom, Nelson, why are you..." Kyla Corbyn was stunned. She realized she was not at home but in a strange room. "Where is this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're in the hospital ward. Grace prepared it for you. She has been accompanying you in the ward. Then it got late and she's pregnant, so I told her to go home and have an early rest."</p></div>
