        <h1>Chapter 3603</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the call ended, Jasper thought about the places William might go to and started searching one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had searched everywhere on campus where he could possibly be, but he was nowhere to be found!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She decided to go to the school and retrieve the surveillance footage, only to discover that William had left the school half an hour ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour ago, which means it was after that post was exposed on the forum, he left the school!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Jasper called his father's secretary, Terrence, again and asked him to help check the road surveillance from the transportation department after William left the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William left the school by car, so that means he was going to a place that is not nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she learned from Terrence where William's car had last stopped, she was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a cemetery!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that place, she heard her parents mention it once when she was young, Lily is buried there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that William went to his mother's grave?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrence, can you help me find out the specific number of William's mother's grave?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each grave in the cemetery has a number, and with the number, we can locate it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll check and let you know in a moment," Terrence said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!" Jasper replied, and hurriedly ran out of the school gate, flagging down a taxi and immediately giving the address of the cemetery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The taxi headed towards the cemetery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was consumed with worry about William's current situation, wishing that the car could go faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the car was halfway there, Terrence called and informed Jasper of Lily's tomb number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Terrence!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to thank me, but what's going on between you and William? Did something happen?" Terrence asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, there was a little incident and I couldn't reach William for a while, so I was worried. But now that I know where he is, I'll find him soon and everything will be fine," Jasper explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, take care of yourself. But your father will also be informed about this today," Terrence said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, this was his way of letting her know that he would report this to her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, I understand," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, she already had bodyguards arranged by her father. Even if Terrence didn't mention it, she guessed that her bodyguards would report to her father later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she wanted to figure out what exactly this post was about. After all, these were all old things, and any related news online had long been deleted. Only some of the older generation in Emerald City knew about the grudges involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So how did the poster know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what was the purpose of posting this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it targeting William? Or the Barlow family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or maybe the Reed family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various speculations filled Jasper's mind at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the car stopped at the entrance of the cemetery. She got out of the car in a swift motion and hurried into the cemetery!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had the number, finding it was still more difficult than she had imagined. After much effort, Jasper finally found a general direction with the help of a cemetery staff member.</span></p></div>
