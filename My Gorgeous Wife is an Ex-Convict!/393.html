        <h1>Chapter 392</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help thinking that he&hellip; really did like her. However, how long could this affection last?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mother must have thought that her father loved her very much when she married him. However, there was not a shred of affection left for her mother in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What had been an unforgettable love was now only a joke as time passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had she not previously been in a loving relationship with Sean too? She thought she had found someone worthy of her life, but he just turned away and kept his distance from her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I'm just fooling around with you too?" Jason asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned, not knowing how to answer him all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That thought had crossed her mind several times now. Even if he was not fooling around with her now, how long could his so-called affection last? She did not have much confidence in this regard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe a year, two years... Maybe only a few months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, what do I have to do to convince you that I'm not fooling around?" He stared at her, and the words his thin lips spat out next almost made her jump off the sofa. "Why don't we get married, then? Will you believe that I'm serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt her heart skip a beat. "Get married?" Was he kidding? How could he just utter those two words so casually?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, get married," Jason said confidently. "I never want another woman in my life, which means you are the only woman I'll ever have by my side. In that case, what's wrong with marrying you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Or do you have no intention of marrying me, Sis?" His fingertips brushed lightly against her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was bewildered and could only feel her heart racing. Her cheek that was being touched by his fingertips was also burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never thought of marrying him. They had just started dating so suddenly too! She never even thought that they would be boyfriend and girlfriend one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her expression immediately told him that she had never thought of it. Jason did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was any other woman, they would have fantasized about marrying him long ago. Many women had approached him, thinking of marrying into the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She, on the other hand, had not thought of it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you agree to date me on the condition that we'll get married? Or are you going to play with my feelings and get rid of me, Sis?" he said as he stared at her with those bright, amorous eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost choked. Play with his feelings... None of these words seemed to fit him, let alone &lsquo;get rid of him&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Or you're already thinking of breaking up with me?" He pressed further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned and tried to open her mouth to speak, but his lips settled on hers before the words could escape her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kissed her hard, so hard that he pried open her teeth and swallowed all she had to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Umm..." She subconsciously wanted to turn away to avoid the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his fingers grabbed her chin to keep her from moving.</p></div>
