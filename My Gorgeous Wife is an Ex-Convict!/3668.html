        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he sat down at the piano, opened the lid, and his slender fingers lightly rested on the black and white keys. "Being too curious isn't always a good thing, is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his voice trailed off, the melodious sound of the piano filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl watched Roger play the piano and for some reason, she felt a chill run down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper had been practicing the piano in the room for an hour, but he couldn't concentrate. He kept thinking about Roger's birthday invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he really sending a gift to his little sister out of hatred for her and the Reed family? Or did he have some other scheme in mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to focus on practicing anymore, she closed the lid of the piano and left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she passed by Roger's room, she couldn't help but pause. Through the glass window of the room, she saw Roger playing the piano while the girl who came with him listened attentively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene reminded her of when they were children and he played the piano for her while she sat by his side and listened to his music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, has he found someone else to listen to him play the piano now? Jasper wondered to herself. If that was the case, she should be happy for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the piano room, she went downstairs to the dormitory and happened to see William standing there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hurried over to him and asked, "Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wanted to see if you were here," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why didn't you call me?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did, but your phone was turned off," he answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out her phone, but it was turned off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper sheepishly stuck out his tongue. "My phone ran out of battery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled. "Do you have any cravings? It's almost dinner time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about we go out to eat?" Jasper suggested. "I feel like having something outside today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," William agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would agree to anything she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them went outside the school, but Jasper stopped in front of a bar next to the school, staring at the door in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about we eat here today?" Jasper suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was a bar, they also served food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you want to have dinner here?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've never had dinner in a place like this before, so I want to try it," Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't yet the busy time for the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bar was playing soft music, making it seem quite peaceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper and William ordered their food and sat at a square table to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was eating dinner in the bar, but her gaze was fixed on another seat not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, Roger was sitting there with his group of friends, drinking and looking sophisticated and aloof, completely different from the Lawrence she remembered from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was precisely because he had grown up that he had become Lawrence!</span></p></div>
