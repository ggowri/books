        <h1>Chapter 1059</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella tried to look more concerned. "Brian, you should go to the hospital and examine your hand. Does it hurt a lot? I'm worried about your hand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you ever worried about Grace?" Brian asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Stella was stunned and momentarily confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you know that Grace once suffered a much worse injury to her hand? Did you ever worry about her hands? You keep saying you two are on good terms. Did you visit her when she was in prison?" asked Brian as he stared at the woman in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was looking up Grace's prison records, he found that during Grace's imprisonment, only her friend, Lina, visited her frequently. Grace's grandmother could not come to Emerald City due to poor health. However, she had called her several times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Other than that, no one cared about Grace when she was in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian thought about Grace's estrangement from her family and friends, he felt a heartbreak he could not even explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was awkward and could not answer Brian's question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, with Hadwin Stephenson's help, Lina ran to Brian and asked, "Where's Grace? How&hellip; How is she? I called her phone, but no one&rsquo;s answering!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said with a pale face, "Jason took her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's heart sank. 'It's exactly... what I had guessed! The problem is&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know where Jason took Grace to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina knew she had asked a silly question as soon as she spoke. Sure enough, Brian shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do we do? Grace..." Lina bit her lip and looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson comforted her by saying, "Jason probably won't do anything outrageous to Grace." After all, Jason still loved Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He already took her, and I can't even get through to her. Isn't he going too far?" She had heard on her way here that Jason and Brian had a conflict and he broke Brian's hand before taking the woman away by force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Needless to say, the woman who was taken away by force was Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace didn't leave with Jason voluntarily!&lsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go to Reed Residence. Maybe Jason took Grace to Reed Residence!" said Lina before dragging Hadwin Stephenson to the parking lot. She got in the car and rushed to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face was gloomy. 'Since Jason took her away like that, he might not bring Grace back to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why&hellip; did Jason take Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the medical staff at the gala hurried over with a medical kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One experienced doctor gasped when he saw how distorted Brian's wrist was. He immediately rushed over and touched Brian's wrist bone. Then, he said, "Young Master Hart, we need to put a cast on your hand. You have to go to the hospital to take an X-ray for us to see what's going on. It might hurt a little when we put on the cast. Please bear with us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said coldly, "Do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor and nurses began to put a cast on his broken wrist right on the spot, but Brian said nothing. Even his expression remained the same. His eyes just kept looking in the direction where Jason's car left.</p></div>
