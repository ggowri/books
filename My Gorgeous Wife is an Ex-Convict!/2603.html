        <h1>Chapter 2601</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could not help raising her hand slightly and stretching it toward his shirt, wanting to see how his wound was healing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she knew he had doctors and nurses looking after him and that his wound would surely heal well, she could not help feeling the urge to take a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'One glance. Just one glance.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told herself and proceeded to unbutton his shirt until she could gently pull it open to see his right rib, which was below his chest...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She saw a hideous wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes suddenly heated up. She had never gotten a good look at the post-operative scar he had after the first liver donation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when they accidentally slept with each other, the room was dark and she struggled so hard that she never got a good look at the scar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, he got injured and was hospitalized after saving her. His body was wrapped in gauze, so she never saw his injury then either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, she finally saw it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The operation wound after the second liver donation was in the same spot as the scar from the first liver donation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had undergone two surgeries on the same spot, and the scars became increasingly obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, this wound...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you seen enough? Since when could this body make you look at it so intently?" a sarcastic voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze immediately, just realizing that Martin Weiss had opened his eyes at some point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&hellip; I just wanted to see your wound,&rdquo; she explained immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Wound? What's there to see? If you want to win the three-month bet, you might as well try to seduce me. That might have some effect."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's face reddened. "I... I didn&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You never thought about winning our bet?&rdquo; he asked, amused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never... thought about..." She could not speak for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" His hand suddenly took hers and pulled hard. The next moment, Kyla was so close to Martin Weiss's body that it seemed as if half of her body was on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What are you trying to do?" His scent filled her nostrils, making her heart beat faster as she stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you find it contradictory to say that you&rsquo;ve never thought about it? And yet you made a three-month bet with me? Kyla, you're not a child. Don't you know what it means for a woman to take off a man's clothes?" he said as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her red lips together tightly and was silent for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Unfortunately, even if you try to seduce me, I&rsquo;ll still have no interest in you. Just like how I have no reaction when you lay on me like this! The three-month bet is only a waste of time!" he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words seemed to be humiliating her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face turned red after being pale, and she said hoarsely, "I don't feel like I'm wasting my time. I'm just fighting for a chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fighting for a chance? So, you took my clothes off to fight for a chance? Since when did you like doing this kind of thing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As I said, I just wanted to see your injury. I just wanted to know how it was healing," she said.</p></div>
