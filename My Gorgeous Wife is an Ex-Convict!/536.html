        <h1>Chapter 535</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking envious, the parent said, "He's your boyfriend? It's nice of your boyfriend to take a kid to class with you. If you get married and have kids, he'll be a good father too. Men seldom have such patience nowadays. Just look at how many of the kids here are accompanied by their mothers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kids... Grace could not help blushing a little. When her conversation with the parent was over, she lowered her head and looked at her flat stomach. All this time she had been taking medicine to condition her body, but she did not know if it was working.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was still a ray of hope. At least, when it came to the topic of children, she would not be as desperate as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a whisper came into her ear. "I'll be a good father when our baby is born."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was suddenly stunned. She turned her head and saw that Jason's upper body had gotten close to her at some point. His face was close to her cheek. When she turned her head, his lips brushed against her cheek, causing her cheek to heat up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I promise I'll protect you and our child." He would not let their children follow in his footsteps. He would give them enough paternal love, and he also believed that she would give their child enough maternal love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not be like his mother who used her child as a bargaining chip, and when she could not achieve her goal, even the bargaining chip was abandoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We... We don't even have kids yet and you're already talking about it," Grace said shyly as she could only feel her cheeks burning up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said with great certainty, "We'll surely have children if you want to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at him. His voice was so sure as if he would do it for her even if it was the hardest thing in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their children... If possible, she hoped they would have a few!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aunt..." Nelson's voice brought Grace to her senses. She realized that Nelson was looking up at her and Jason in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly took her mind off the matter and told Nelson that she was fine in sign language. Her reddened face probably made the little one worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the teacher came to the classroom and began the class. The parents would let the children touch some props or perform some actions according to what was being taught to make them understand the meaning of the sounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked on. He helped Grace occasionally by giving her a hand. Slowly, Nelson seemed to become more and more accepting of Jason. He would even pronounce the word &lsquo;Uncle&rsquo; in a shaky voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time the two-hour class was over, the little one was already interacting with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a bit surprised. Nelson was somewhat resistant to outsiders. According to Kyla, Nelson acting so close to her when he first met her was a special case and it had never happened before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson would never go near the customers in the restaurant. He would not even interact with the employees who had been working in the small restaurant for quite some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Most of the time, the grown-ups were eager to tease the little one, but he did not even bother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was amazed that Nelson would interact with Jason. 'Can it be that&hellip; Uh, children like him?' Grace thought to herself before bursting out laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyway, it was good enough that he and Nelson got along well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they got back to the car, Grace took out her phone and saw a message from Kyla. A moment later, she looked up at Jason and asked, "Well... Can Nelson come with us to the premiere?"</p></div>
