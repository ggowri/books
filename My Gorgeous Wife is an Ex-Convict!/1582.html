        <h1>Chapter 1580</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if unknowingly, he could no longer allow her to leave. He had a sudden and stronger urge to find out how he loved her in those memories he lost...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson returned to his mansion in Emerald City, he found Katherine Jackson sitting on the couch in the living room. She appeared to be leisurely waiting for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who let you in?" Hadwin Stephenson narrowed his eyes and stared at Katherine Jackson with displeasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm your girlfriend, President Stephenson. If I want to come in, can the security guards outside stop me?" Katherine Jackson said with a chuckle. Her gorgeous face seemed even more enchanting. "Did you go to see your ex-girlfriend again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face instantly darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Yes, he had gone to see Lina again, but... he only secretly watched her while hiding in the shadows. He watched her leave work in the same car she had five years ago, go on another date with the same man he had seen that day, and saw the way she smiled at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, all he could do was watch. No matter how painful it was or how jealous he felt, he had no right to approach her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Lina. That's my Lina!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What a pity though. No matter how much you go over to look at your ex-girlfriend, you can never be together. Speaking of which, how old is she? She's probably 33 now. She'll probably get married in a year or two. A woman can't afford to waste her youth!" Katherine Jackson walked up to Hadwin Stephenson and touched his chest with her fingernails that were painted red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Shut up!" Hadwin Stephenson instantly grabbed Katherine Jackson's hand and shook it off. His eyes were full of disgust. "Don't touch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? It's been five years and you're still in denial?" Katherine Jackson shook her hand nonchalantly. "Don't forget, it was you who cried and begged me to save Lina's life. Otherwise, she would&rsquo;ve probably died on her way back instead of being hospitalized for serious injuries.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face turned cold. He felt like he could not breathe every time he thought about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin, I gave you everything you wanted&mdash;Lina's life and absolute control of the Stephenson family. But the price you have to pay... is to be with me and never get back together with Lina! Weren't you willing to pay such a price back then?" Katherine Jackson asked loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson breathed heavily, but his face was pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Yeah, it was my decision. I decided that... I could no longer be with Lina.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin, why are you so obsessed with Lina? Am I not beautiful or good enough?" Katherine Jackson's eyes were seductive, showing her charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every man she had ever set her eyes on ended up falling for her, but Hadwin Stephenson seemed to be an exception. If she had not used Lina's life and the Stephenson family, this man would not be with her right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the more he did that, the more she wanted to conquer him! She found it fun!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I've been waiting for you for five years too. Speaking of which, I'm almost 30. Shouldn't you give me a wedding and make me the legitimate Mrs. Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pressed his thin lips together tightly. To him, his wife was always Lina.</p></div>
