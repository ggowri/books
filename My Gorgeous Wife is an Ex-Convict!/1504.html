        <h1>Chapter 1502</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No." However, the person who answered him was not Kyla but Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss walked to the front of Nelson and said to his son, "She&rsquo;s still alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if Nelson had yet to completely accept Martin Weiss. After seeing Martin Weiss approaching him, he subconsciously shielded Kyla as though his father might harm his mother. It was up to him to protect his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was just a four-year-old kid, yet he had his guard up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sight of it made Martin Weiss taste something bitter in his mouth, but he had no way to vent out his frustration, and neither could he complain about it. It was because it was his fault that they had fallen to this state now! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At the very beginning, Nelson used to love him as well and would even show affectionate smiles to him. Nelson would request him to carry him and ride on his neck, even greeting him as &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, currently&hellip; Everything was different! It was all because of his foolishness that made Nelson distance himself from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Rest assured, Daddy won't hurt Mommy. No matter what happens, I&rsquo;ll never do it again,&rdquo; Martin Weiss muttered softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knew that he might have to live the rest of his life feeling guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla held her son's hand and turned around to head in the direction of the bus station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes glinted darkly. Then, he followed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The three of them, two at the front and one behind, walked straight ahead. When the bus arrived, Martin Weiss could not help himself and suddenly asked, "Do you&hellip; Do you have nothing else to say to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla turned around and looked at Martin Weiss faintly. "I'm very grateful that you're willing to help search for Grace, but regarding our past, I've nothing much to comment on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All she ever said to him these days was that she had nothing to comment on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the bus had left far away, Martin Weiss was still standing in front of the station while daydreaming. The bitter feeling was still in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had lots of things to talk to her about now, but she no longer wanted to talk to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'However, at the very least&hellip; she's still alive.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps her being alive was the greatest thing heaven could gift him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss recalled the moment he saw the look on Jason&rsquo;s face. That devastation and dispirited aura&hellip; He seemed to be using sheer willpower to hold down the fort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was completely different from how Jason seemed before. In just a short period, a man who had total control in Emerald City had become devastated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason had great influence in Emerald City, and everyone was aware of it. No one ever thought that this man would be easily defeated. However, once his woman went missing, it made this man utterly lifeless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If they managed to find Grace but it was just her corpse, then Jason&hellip; would perhaps be no different than a dead person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The huge empire of Reed group would just come crashing down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Will the future of Emerald City change?' Martin Weiss sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Time slowly passed as day after day went by. However, there was still no news about Grace. Despite the continuous expansion of the area of search, with them searching not just the sea but tMason Swansonty as well, everyone no longer held on to any ray of hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No one thought that Grace would still be alive. Now, it was just a matter of time before they spotted her corpse.</p></div>
