        <h1>Chapter 4370 Scandal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback. Even though Calvert was wearing a hat and mask, obscuring his expression, she couldn't shake the feeling that he seemed on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart became especially heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was different from her, or rather, this young man was unlike any of the friends she knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of her friends came from wealthy families. Even though there might have been some disputes and intrigues within their families, it never gave off a sense of tragedy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even many people, despite not having received their parents' love, still enjoyed the best conditions in life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the people she knew from ordinary backgrounds, most of them lived harmoniously and happily with their families. They had a very blessed life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Calvert's family was not harmonious, and their living conditions were not good either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that he had managed to live like this up until that point was all due to his willpower being much stronger than the average person's. He was determined to fight tooth and nail to change his destiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was also asking herself if she had gone through all these things, could she still live as he does now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't." She lifted her hand, her warm palm touching his cheek through his mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all she wanted was to do just that, to comfort him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert suddenly stiffened, his beautiful black eyes staring at her wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert, we're friends. As long as you don't use me for your own gain, I won't betray you. Let's make that our agreement, okay?" She said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Adam's apple bobbed, and after a long pause, he finally agreed in a hoarse voice, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, not far away, someone was holding up their phone, capturing that scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are they filming over there?" someone nearby asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This could be big news, might even make a decent amount of money." The person taking the photos said happily, looking at the pictures on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized this woman as the daughter of the Hart family, the princess of the entertainment industry. She wasn't only the person everyone in the industry wanted to please, but also a figure of curiosity to the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many media outlets were eager to dig up some juicy news from this princess, but they didn't expect her life to be so simple that there was really no big news to uncover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, although this princess had a </span><span>fianc</span><span>&eacute;, his background was so powerful that no one dared to meddle in the affairs between the princess and her fianc&eacute;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after the two had called off their engagement, there still wasn't much news coverage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things were different then. The princess had just broken off her engagement not too long ago, and she was dating a man at an amusement park. If that news had gotten out, it might have just shaken up the entire entertainment industry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, when Harley was asked by a friend, "Are you dating Calvert?" she was completely taken aback!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would you think I'm dating him?" she asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard from my brother that someone is trying to sell your scandalous photos for a high price, and they're looking for a buyer!" Karen said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley almost choked on his own saliva. How could there be scandalous photos!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she not have known about her own scandal? And it was a scandal with Calvert, no less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Calvert actually hadn't met very often. The most recent time had been on Calvert's birthday when they went to the amusement park together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's eyebrows furrowed.</span></p></div>
