        <h1>Chapter 1879</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, I'm doing this because..." She tried to explain, but his fingers pressed on her lips, preventing her from going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, her eyes suddenly widened. She saw his other hand pull out an amulet and a bottle of pills from his pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That was the amulet Brian had given her. That was where she got the address to seek help to find her mentor and his wife. The bottle of pills was the sleeping pills she had prepared. She had added sleeping pills to the vegetable beef soup tonight, but he, who should be asleep right now, was in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You went to the address Brian left you and drugged me for Mrs. Watts. Grace, is this how you love me?" His fingers played with the two objects in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's face grew paler, and her throat burned. 'He knows! Or, should I say, he has it all under control?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I changed the pills in your bottle into ordinary vitamins so I wouldn&rsquo;t fall asleep as you planned. As for the person you contacted to help you today..." Jason's eyes glanced aside, and Grace saw that the man who was supposed to help her tonight was standing not far away. He was subdued and unable to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The man also looked at Grace with embarrassment, apparently unaware Jason had already figured out their plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had not only offended Jason but also Young Master Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you already know what I was going to do?" Grace's voice cracked as she spat out the words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," he answered her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then why did you deliberately wait for us here? Why didn't you expose me from the very beginning?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared at her as he tucked a strand of hair that was beside her cheek behind her ear, something he always did. Then, he leaned over slightly and said in a soft yet cold voice, "Because I wanted to see what choice the woman I love the most would make."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She felt her heart sink. It was as if it had sunk into a bottomless pit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But it turns out the person I love the most would rather choose to hurt me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just don't want you to regret it!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Regret?" Jason sneered. "What do I have to regret? Will you regret it? Will you regret doing this in vain?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Regret it? But I had no choice.' She had to let Mrs. Watts get treatment first so that there was still a chance to fix things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Take these two back," Jason commanded the men around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No!" Grace grabbed Jason's hand, "Mrs. Watts can't go back. She needs treatment! Or she'll die because of her high fever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you want to help her so badly?" He glared at her coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know you hate her, but I don&rsquo;t want you to kill your own mother no matter how much you hate her! Jay, Mrs. Watts regrets what she did back then. What about you? Do you want to regret it someday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said firmly, "I'll never regret it! Grace, leave this matter alone and go home with me. I can pretend this never happened!"</p></div>
