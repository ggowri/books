        <h1>Chapter 1697</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, Wanna. Listen to me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's your fault. It's your fault! Mommy said you're the worst. It's because of you that Mr. Reed doesn't like my mommy!" With that said, Oriel Lynch jumped off the chair, ran up to Jason, and said, "Mr. Reed, she's a bad person. She bullied my mommy. Mr. Reed, didn't you used to help us chase away bad people? Can you chase her away? That way, my mommy can come back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's heart sank. She did not expect a five-year-old to say such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at Oriel Lynch coldly. "Who taught you to say that? Who told you Young Madam is a bad person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch was startled by the look in Jason's eyes but she still tried to look pitiful and said, "Mommy said... she's not a good person. She doesn't like Mr. Reed at all. Otherwise, she wouldn't have left you for five years! Mr. Reed, Mommy... Mommy and I like you very much. We're never gonna leave you. Will you chase her away? I... I'll be a good daughter. I'll be better than Jasper Reed&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's enough!" Jason interrupted Oriel Lynch and said coldly, "You were never my daughter. The Reed family took care of you just because Mick wanted a sister, but it doesn't mean you can say such things. You'll understand what your mother did after you grow up. You never have to enter Reed Residence again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, she's just a kid," Grace could not help saying. Although what Oriel Lynch said about her disappointed her, she found it slightly cruel to tell a child the same age as Jasper such a reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what? Even if she's a kid, she should know what's right and wrong! She should know who's in the wrong rather than saying anything she wants just because she's young!" said Jason. Then, he summoned the maids and told them to take Oriel Lynch away from Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, Mr. Reed, I'm your daughter and the daughter of the Reed family. I'm better and more obedient than Jasper Reed. Why do you want Jasper and not me?" Oriel Lynch cried loudly and wanted to approach Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she was only five years old. A maid picked Oriel Lynch up in her arms and quickly left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace sighed and asked, "Are you still going to cancel the adoption?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We never did the formal paperwork for it. I just announced it. The so-called cancelation is only an announcement," said Jason. Then, he paused a little before adding, "Even if you're against it this time, I'm going to announce the cancelation of the adoption."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace pursed her lips and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew that if Oriel Lynch had not said what she said, maybe Jay would not have made this decision. However, Oriel Lynch thought of her as an enemy, so they could not keep her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then, her life..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "Irene Lynch has made a lot of money from the Reed family in the past two years. Otherwise, how do you think she was able to lead such a life with only 200,000 dollars of monthly allowance from the Reed family? Even if Irene Lynch goes to jail, the money's enough to raise Oriel Lynch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace thought about it and agreed. Besides, the Reed family had never formally adopted Oriel Lynch. To put it bluntly, they did not have any legal ties to Oriel Lynch. Once Irene Lynch went to jail, Oriel Lynch's guardian would change to her next of kin, which would be her biological father or her grandparents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It would be hard for outsiders to intervene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't worry. I'll ask Terrence to follow up on the child. You don't have to worry about anything," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace nodded. It was all they could do now. The child would know right from wrong when she got older!</p></div>
