        <h1>Chapter 796</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove past her without stopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's normal, isn't it? We've broken up, and from now on, we'll go our separate ways and have nothing to do with each other!&rsquo; Grace said quietly to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, what's the matter? What are you looking at?" Chase Harper's voice once again rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace withdrew her eyes and looked at Chase Harper again, saying, "Nothing. I have something to do, so I gotta go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait! I'll take you wherever you want to go. My car is just around the corner," Chase Harper said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I'll just take the bus. It's convenient."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." He hesitated for a moment, then took out a business card from his pocket and handed it to Grace. "This is my business card with my contact information and my current work address on it. You can come to me if you need any help!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the man in front of her. He was different from when he was at the Sanitation Service Center. He was no longer wearing the team uniform but a suit and tie as well as a different hairstyle. She caught a glimpse of the business card he handed her. He was a director of a car dealership.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that he had really gone into business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However&hellip; Now, he was looking at her the same way he had looked at her when they were at the Sanitation Service Center&mdash;clear, shy, and... respectful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he looked at her with respect. Other people looked down on her in those days because she had been to prison and was sweeping the streets, but he never did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that she did not take the card, Chase Harper's face was once again full of confusion. "What's the matter? Is it inconvenient?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her eyes, shook her head, and took the business card. "Nothing. I just didn't expect you to become the director of a car dealership."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a title. I've invested some money, and it's currently a start-up," Chase Harper said with a shy smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was about to walk to the bus stop, it was as if he had plucked up the courage to suddenly ask, "By the way, do you... have a boyfriend now? Or... are you single?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he asked the question, an indifferent and gorgeous face flashed across his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is the man who called her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; and who showed a strong desire to have her to himself still with her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm single, but..." Grace looked at Chase Harper and said lightly, "I'm not looking for another boyfriend nor another relationship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, if Chase Harper still had any feelings for her, she hoped that he could let go and stop holding on to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would never be a good match!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurried to the bus stop. She had an interview to hurry to today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Chase Harper stared blankly at Grace's back with a feeling that he could not even explain welling up in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is that man no longer with her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
