        <h1>Chapter 1681</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Grace returned to Reed Residence, she changed her clothes in the bedroom. She was planning to pick up her two little ones from kindergarten afterward. Just then, Jason came back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why are you home so early?" Grace asked in surprise as she put on her shirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There's nothing much going on in the office today, so I came home early," Jason said as he approached her and raised his hand to button her shirt for her. "Let me do it for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She blushed a little. She was wearing nothing but her bra underneath her shirt. Although he often helped her wear her clothes these days, she still could not help blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He looked at her flushed face with fascination. She was blushing because of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His long fingers buttoned her shirt button by button while his voice rang nonchalantly. "Where did you go today?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "I went to the hospital. I went to see Sean's mother, who's hospitalized. She has kidney disease and owes more than 20,000 dollars in medical bills. She also needs 100,000 dollars for follow-up treatment. So I deposited money into Sean's mother's medical insurance account."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" Jason gently looked down, his hands never stopping what they were doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sorry, I should have mentioned this to you first, but I didn't decide to pay for her medical bills until I went to the hospital," said Grace. She had only made up her mind after meeting Mrs. Stevens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If it turned out Mrs. Stevens hated her with all her heart, she might not have paid for her medical bills. However, Mrs. Stevens had begged for her children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Grace did not like Mrs. Stevens, she cared a lot about her children. Grace was also the mother of one son and one daughter. She would not hesitate to die for them either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason chuckled. "There's no need to apologize for such a thing. Everything in the Reed family is yours, and your decision is also mine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then what happened? Did you meet Sean at the hospital?" Jason seemed to ask casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Yes, we exchanged a few words. I paid the medical bills to repay Sean for saving me. We won't owe each other anything from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His fingers stopped slightly. Then, he bent over and buried his face in her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter?" she asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He muttered, "I&rsquo;m just thinking how great it&rsquo;d be if I were the one who saved you that day. If I had been by your side that day, I would&rsquo;ve spared no effort to save you. I wouldn't have let you suffer any harm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A scene instantly recurred to Grace. They were at the seaside, and he had crouched down with his fingers pressing on something. He looked up at her with a wary expression and said, "Grace, don't be afraid. You'll be fine. I won't let anything happen to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The scene soon faded, and those words seemed to be the only thing she could hear at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What's going on here? What did I just see? Seaside? Is this the memory of me falling into the sea? Oh yes. Terrence once mentioned that Jay had pushed the button of the device set up by Old master Reed with the intention to sacrifice himself to save me!'</p></div>
