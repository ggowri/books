        <h1>Chapter 3547</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, a photo caused a stir on the school forum once again. The photo was posted by an anonymous person and showed Jasper and Roger with their faces close together, appearing to be kissing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the photo, Jasper's cheek was clearly visible, but Roger was only seen from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, Jasper's identity was quickly revealed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The kissing scene between the Reed family's eldest princess and the mysterious boy immediately sparked discussions among many people in the school. Some even speculated that William had been dumped by the princess or that she was playing both sides. Jasper found it somewhat amusing and frustrating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's ridiculous! In the photo, I was just looking at the mole on his neck, not kissing him!" Jasper complained to William in the restaurant booth. "You have no idea, even my roommates automatically assumed it was a love triangle. They keep telling me not to be fickle and leave you for someone else. I don't even know what to say to them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper spoke and then looked at William. "What do you think? You don't look like a poor little thing who has fallen out of favor. I wonder how they came up with that idea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's gaze fixed on Jasper. "So, do you get tired of someone easily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She almost sprayed the food in her mouth out. After finally swallowing, she said, "Why are you joking? We're not in a relationship, so there's no getting tired of someone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pursed his lips. "What about if you were in a relationship? Would you get tired of someone easily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course not," she said firmly. "If I were in a relationship, that person would be my first and last. No matter what happens, I will love that person forever and never change."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she said this, there was a dreamy color on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He, on the other hand, looked at her somewhat dazedly, almost using all his willpower to restrain the words that were about to blurt out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's not possible now, it's not the right time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't understand the feelings between men and women yet. She still only saw him as a childhood friend and hadn't thought about love. If he said it now, he was afraid it would affect their current relationship, afraid that she would avoid him, and afraid that she wouldn't speak freely in front of him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he would endure a little longer, and be patient a little longer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Slowly guide her emotions, and then at the right opportunity, tell her about his feelings for all these years!" William said to himself in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had endured for so many years, so what harm was there in continuing to endure for a while longer?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Jasper said, "By the way, William, can you help me look up information on Roger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? You want to investigate him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I still think he might be Lawrence," Jasper said. "The position of the mole on his neck is the same as Lawrence's, and his appearance, as well as the fact that he plays Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige, always makes me feel too coincidental. So I want you to help me check his background and information before he was 10 years old. You should have a way to check, right?"</p></div>
