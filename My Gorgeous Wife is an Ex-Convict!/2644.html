        <h1>Chapter 2642</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips slightly and looked at her in the long mint-green dress. The color made her look fairer. Her apple-like face shape, round eyes, and faint smile made her look amicable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tension that filled his body seemed to gradually disappear when he saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not bad," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take this dress, then," said Valda Theller as she walked back to the fitting room and changed out of the dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she walked out of the fitting room to pay for it, the shop assistant said, "Your boyfriend has already paid for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Valda Theller looked at Brian in surprise. "That's inappropriate. I'll transfer the money to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no need for that. Now that we&rsquo;re dating, it's only natural that I buy you a dress," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the problem was they were only pretending to be dating!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned and walked out of the boutique. Valda Theller hurried after him with her shopping bag. "I don't think this is right. We agreed that I&rsquo;ll be your fake girlfriend while you be my model, so there&rsquo;s no reason for you to help me pay my bill."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Valda Theller said, "If you were really my boyfriend, I&rsquo;d have no opinion about you buying me a dress because it's common for couples to give each other gifts. But you gave me a dress in our situation. What if you also give me something else that caught my eye tomorrow? It might not matter to you as these things don&rsquo;t cost much. But I might get under the illusion that you have feelings for me and we're really dating if I keep getting presents from you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian understood that the woman in front of him was hoping to draw a line with him as soon as he heard that. Any other woman would have tried to get more out of him if she were pretending to date him. She was an exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he might not have been so impulsive as to ask her to pretend to be his girlfriend if she were like any other woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Okay, got it. I won't do it again. Consider this my token of gratitude for helping me out. Just this once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A-Alright then." Valda Theller could not take it too seriously since he had said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two went to the parking lot, and Valda Theller instantly saw Brian's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, your car is over there..." She had barely finished her sentence when a hand caught hers. The next moment, she fell into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bri Brian?" Valda Theller froze, instinctively wanting to push him away. However, his arms tightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't move," he said in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Confused as she was, she obeyed his words and did not push him away again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hold me." His voice rang in her ears again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She was stunned. "Hold... old you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, hold me. Hold me as lovers do," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated slightly before slowly stretching out her hands to wrap around Brian's waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What a thin... waist!' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was immediately jealous of his waist once she held him. Any woman would be jealous of it. She could feel that he did not have much fat on his waist even through his clothes.</p></div>
