        <h1>Chapter 1621</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason turned to his subordinates and said, "Those who failed to do their duty today will be punished later. Also, find out what's going on with these people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes,&rdquo; said the subordinate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, one of the men subdued by Jason's men struggled to raise his head and shouted, "Grace, you damned lawyer! Don't think this is over just because you ran to Emerald City. You and your mentor conspired to put me in prison for two and a half years, causing my wife and children to leave me. I want you to pay the price!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only now did Grace recognize the middle-aged man who was screaming in front of her. He was the defendant in one of her cases, and she had been the plaintiff's lawyer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The plaintiff won the case, and the defendant was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I did nothing wrong. You got what you deserved in this case."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It was you! You and your mentor used me as a stepping stone to make names for yourselves in the legal world. You're just a shameless&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before the man could finish, someone already covered his mouth and a car pulled over. Jason dragged Grace and said, "Get in the car first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But Lina and..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"My men will get them out of here. They&rsquo;ll be alright," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at the spectacle in front of her. There were so many people around, and she could not see where Lina and Anthony Sherman were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In this case, it was better to leave as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She bit her lip slightly and got into the car. Then, she pulled out her phone and called Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The phone rang for some time but no one answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace immediately panicked. "Something must have happened to Lina. Jay, I'm going to find her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "Don't worry. My men should have news about Lina in a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, sometime later, Jason's phone rang. His subordinate called to report that they had only found Anthony Sherman and were sending him back to his residence first. Lina was taken away by Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson?" Grace was stunned. 'When did Hadwin Stephenson show up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And he took Lina away. What&rsquo;s going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since Hadwin Stephenson took Lina away, you don't have to worry," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Believe me. Hadwin Stephenson would never hurt Lina," Jason said affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he saw the look of pain and despair in Hadwin Stephenson's eyes at the banquet that day, he understood that the man still loved Lina. Five years had passed, but the fact had not changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace disagreed with Jason. "If he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt Lina, then he wouldn't have broken up with Lina back then. He chose to hurt Lina to get the rights to the Stephenson family. Who knows if he's going to hurt Lina because of something else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're always... worrying about Lina," muttered Jason. It was true then and also true now.</p></div>
