        <h1>Chapter 2014</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked down slightly and sighed, "Yes, he can have plenty of healthy children if he wants to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So don't think about handing Nelson to Martin Weiss. The two of us can raise the boy well. The school principal and teachers already know Nelson has Grace, the mistress of the Reed family as his godmother, so no one will dare to bully him anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn paused and then said, "Besides, Nelson's your everything. If you give him to Martin Weiss, what will you do? Can you really take it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, Mom. It's getting late. You'd better go to bed early," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once Mrs. Corbyn left the room, Kyla's eyes fell on her son's wounded and swollen cheek once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her son was her life, so she could risk her life for Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As long as Nelson could have a bright future, she could do anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, Grace told Jason about what had happened at the school during the day and that Nelson needed a new hearing aid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even my heart broke when I saw the way Nelson looked today, let alone Kyla," said Grace. A well-behaved child like Nelson would not have done that if he had not been pushed to his limit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason consoled her, saying, "After today, no one in that school will dare to bully him again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I guess so. The principal will probably talk to all the other teachers at school. Even though they won't bully him openly and directly, I wonder if they'll isolate him because of his flaws or something. He&rsquo;s only in primary school now. What about middle school, high school..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "No one can bear these for him. He has to slowly grow up and face these things himself. He's a boy, so he has to be tough. Otherwise, how is he going to protect the people he wants to protect in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We can only hope Nelson will get stronger," said Grace, and the conversation turned to the triplets' birthday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The triplets' birthday was approaching. It was the first birthday with all the triplets found, so Grace was taking it seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The triplets were separated in the past. With all three together now, they hoped to officially announce the Reed family's triplets to the public with this birthday party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although Grace had hoped the triplets' birthday would be simple and warm, she knew their first birthday had to be a grand occasion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Grace was shocked when she saw the guestlist Jason showed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's... just a children's birthday party. Do we have to invite all these people?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Either we don't invite anyone, or we have to invite all of them. Some people will overthink if we don&rsquo;t invite them," said Jason. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace thought about it and agreed. However, almost all of Emerald City's upper class were coming. It no longer seemed to be the three children&rsquo;s birthday party but a party for the upper class!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the Reed family&rsquo;s house, William was also thinking about the triplets' birthday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The butler said the triplets would be having a big party for their birthday this year, but... he could not attend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;After all, you know what kind of relationship your mother had with the Reed family. If you attend the party, you&rsquo;ll be photographed by reporters at the party. Someone will reveal your identity and give the Reed family a hard time. So stay in your room on the day of the birthday party, okay?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Uncle Kwan's words echoed again in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would have liked to celebrate her birthday but was condemned to stay in his room without going anywhere.</p></div>
