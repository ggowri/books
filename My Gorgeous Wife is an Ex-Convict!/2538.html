        <h1>Chapter 2536</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judging from Amber Mitchell's expression when she was talking to George Gregory, Amber Mitchell seemed to not have any affection for George Gregory. She did not seem to want to be with George Gregory again as the news mentioned online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead, George Gregory looked jealous and disappointed as if he had been abandoned by someone he loved deeply!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was George Gregory still deeply in love with Amber Mitchell?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reporter chuckled as the speculation flashed across his head. 'What does it have to do with me? I just have to make sure I get the money!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trial drew near. When Amber Mitchell knew Brian was leaving, she went to see him off with the Moss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, I appreciate all your help thus far," said Amber Mitchell. Brian agreed in a heartbeat when she asked him for help, which was why Stan Lucas agreed to appear in court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stan Lucas might have disagreed to testify in court if she were the one who asked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you're Grace's friend, I'll help you," said Brian. Brian was a little melancholic at the thought of Grace's departure. 'I wonder how Grace is doing. Is the baby she's carrying okay?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I'm also glad to have met a friend like Grace. I hope her pregnancy will go smoothly and she can make it through this!" Amber Mitchell said as she thought of her phone conversation with Grace the other day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her statement made Brian's expression change. "What do you mean she can make it through? What's going on with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She..." Amber Mitchell froze and immediately realized that Brian had no idea about Grace's current situation. Should she tell him about Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Brian and Grace...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me!" Brian was worried. Even his phoenix eyes began to redden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell could only say vaguely, "Her pregnancy this time is a little tough, but Grace is confident about being able to give birth to the baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A little tough? What's going on?' Brian's expression changed. Suddenly, he turned around and walked to the exit of the airport.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell and the Moss family were stunned. It was time for Brian to board the plane. Why did he leave?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd quickly ran out of the airport, only to find Brian in a car speeding away from the airport.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera murmured, "Is Brian... going back to Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just speculation, but Amber Mitchell suddenly found it possible when she heard it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only made one statement, yet his expression changed so drastically. They could see how much he cared about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Grace was already married and had children, Brian was still deeply in love with Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's heart sank at the thought of the impact Brian&rsquo;s arrival in Emerald City might cause Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Brian would not have gone to Emerald City if she had not said those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We should probably go back," added Whitney Herrera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no point in them staying at the airport now that the person they wanted to see off was gone.</p></div>
