        <h1>Chapter 1957</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is it... Mr. Stephenson's?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The butler shuddered at the thought, thinking it might be another piece of explosive news for J City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina later called her parents. Of course, she did not tell her parents about her getting slapped but said she would be staying over at Hadwin Stephenson's for the night. In a separate room, of course. Then, she asked her parents to hand over the pregnancy pillow when someone came over to collect it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney questioned their daughter for a long time, they could not get answers to why she was suddenly spending the night in Hadwin Stephenson's house. However, their daughter sounded rather joyful, so it was probably a good thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson's staff came to collect the pregnancy pillow, Mrs. Sweeney asked them to bring her daughter some cakes she made herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at the pregnancy pillow his staff had brought back, only to find that it was not only a pillow. Besides being a regular pillow, it also cushioned one&rsquo;s back for when one lay on the side. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With a pillow like this, one could say that she would be all wrapped up in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're going to sleep with a pillow like that?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, the further into the pregnancy, the more uncomfortable it is to lie on my back. It's more comfortable to lie on the side. This pillow is extremely soft. It's soft to hold to sleep. It's just like hugging you to sleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's ears reddened slightly. 'Does this woman always talk with no filter? Just like hugging me to sleep? She speaks as if she hugs me to sleep every day.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"By the way, do you want to eat this cake? Didn&rsquo;t you love eating the cakes my mom made whenever you came to my house?" asked Lina as she took out a soft and small cake from the food container.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at the cake she held in her hand. The scenes of what had happened at her home back then seemed to recur to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had always found the Stephenson family cold, full of conspiracies and plots. Even if they looked like they were laughing and talking, behind those smiles were calculating thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it was different with the Sweeney family. With the Sweeney family, he did not have to guess anything. He could easily integrate into the family and laugh whenever he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps only a family like that could make her who she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson could not help taking the cake in Lina's hand and putting it to his lips before taking a bite. It was soft, chewy, and sweet but not too nauseating. It was as delicious as back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well? My mom&rsquo;s cakes are just as good as before, aren&rsquo;t they?" Lina asked with a smile. Her cheeks were red and swollen, while the corners of her lips were injured. She could not eat the cake, but he could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson did not answer her but finished the cake in his hand. Then, he said to Lina, "Remember to apply the ointment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I have to apply it on myself in the mirror. It's too troublesome. Why don't you help me?" she said cheekily, holding out the ointment the hospital had prescribed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson glared at Lina, but his staring was nothing to her. She continued holding the ointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson finally took the ointment. He dabbed some on his fingers and gently smeared it on the red and swollen parts of her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hey, ouch... Ouch, ouch!" She instantly wailed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, he could not help but minimize the strength in his hand and carefully applied the ointment to her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even Hadwin Stephenson could not understand it. Did he not plan to ignore her and stop having feelings for her? However, he seemed to surrender every time he was with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He clearly seemed to be the strong one while she was the weak one.</p></div>
