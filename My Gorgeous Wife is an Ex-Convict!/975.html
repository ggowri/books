        <h1>Chapter 974</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart was pounding violently because of the look in her eyes. It was as if his body, heart, and blood were telling him how much she meant to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heartbeat was so clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Step by step, he walked toward the figure. He just wanted to be closer to her. He just wanted to see those eyes clearer and let his figure reflect in those serene orbs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian finally reached Grace, and the next moment, he stretched out his hands to grab the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. She did not expect Brian to embrace her in public so suddenly. He was holding her so tightly that she could not break free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, let go of me," bellowed Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't let go. This time, I won't let go!" he murmured, tightening his arms a little more. It was as if he was going to embed her into his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only by holding her like this could the fear he felt earlier slowly calm down, and his empty heart felt like it was being filled up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All this time, he thought she looked just like what he imagined the little girl would look like when she grew up. He thought that since she was not the one he was looking for, he could easily treat her as a stranger and stop caring about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that even if she did hit her head, bleed, and fall in front of him, he could remain indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was not until that night at the banquet when he saw her thin figure standing for so long and the sight of her limping when she left that his heart began to throb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, he saw her and Jason together again. He went to her office to look for her, and when he saw that she was in danger, he did not even think twice before rushing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he did not want her to get hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he knew she was missing and saw on the surveillance footage that she had walked out of the shot without being seen again, he felt extreme fear because of someone else for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, all he could think about was... 'Nothing must happen to her. Please don't let anything happen to her. If anything happens to her, what do I do?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if at that moment, he did not even know what his purpose in life was. If she no longer exists, then his existence seemed meaningless too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Admit it. Even if there are some things I don't want to admit, I still have to admit it!' A voice kept saying in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman had unconsciously occupied his heart. He could not get rid of her and desperately wanted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, let go. Let go of me..." Her voice rang in his ears again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Let go? How could I let go again? I&rsquo;ve let go again and again because of Jason. This time... I must follow my heart's desires.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I told you. I won't let go, because..." His voice paused, then he said those three words&mdash;the three words he had never said to anyone else, "I love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, I love her. I've fallen in love, so deeply in love!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was in a trance, thinking she had misheard him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What did you say?" she asked, surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He repeated, "I love you! Therefore, as long as I live, I'll never let you go again." Instead of the usual coldness, his voice was full of deep yearning.</p></div>
