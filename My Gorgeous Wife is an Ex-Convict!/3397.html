        <h1>Chapter 3395</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this time, Lornell was also in the hospital room. When he heard what Tina said to Harley, he looked up at Chandler and asked, "Did you do all these things?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I did," Chandler admitted straightforwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Chandler did it too!" Tina chimed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell stared at Chandler and asked, "You're doing something so boring?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fortunately, it's not that boring," said Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How is it possible to not be bored? Accompanying to play, buying things, and even helping with homework, there's no fun at all! Usually, many people ask him to play, but he's too lazy to play with others!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Let alone helping others with their homework, he has never done anything like this before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, no one dares to ask him for help with homework when he's around!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Lornell turned to Harley and said, "I'll tell you, I never intended to do it this way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you're my fianc&eacute;," Harley blinked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what?" Anyway, he won't do such a stupid thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Chandler has undoubtedly become synonymous with idiocy in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But isn't that what fianc&eacute;s are supposed to do?" Harley asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who said that! If the fianc&eacute; wants to do such a boring thing, then what should the fianc&eacute;e do?" said Lornell. Although he usually has a mature and calm demeanor beyond his age, he is still a 7-year-old child at heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially, he didn't even realize that his emotions could easily be stirred up by Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked this way, and Harley turned to look at Tina. "Yeah, what is the fianc&eacute;e going to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina giggled and said, "It's just about eating, playing, and when facing difficulties, you should tell your fianc&eacute;. You can't keep secrets and must be honest and polite with your fianc&eacute;. It's important to be united and friendly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley listened carefully, then tapped her fingers and compared herself to Lornell. She looked at him seriously and said, "I can do it, I can be a great fianc&eacute;e."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell has black lines all over his head, but he doesn't feel like she's doing anything at all. It's like she's not doing anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is the one who has to do everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Lornell glared at Chandler with dissatisfaction and asked, "Does your fianc&eacute;e usually do these things?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh, it's about right," said Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could you tolerate that?" Lornell was somewhat incredulous. In his impression of Chandler before, he was someone who didn't like to meddle in other people's business and was also arrogant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he knew early on that Chandler was engaged, he never expected that the relationship between Chandler and Tina would turn out like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I'm afraid that if he tells his friends from other Crypt families, no one will believe him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since I'll have to endure it sooner or later, what's the difference between enduring it earlier or later?" Chandler said. "Tina is the person I chose, and since people can't change, I have to change myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Lornell looked at Harley sitting on the hospital bed. So, does that mean he also chose her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, when he saw her lying in the IUC ward, he chose her when he called the Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So in the future, the only thing he can change is himself?</p></div>
