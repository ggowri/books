        <h1>Chapter 4276 Seeing another side of him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina arrived at Chandler's residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been here many times with Chandler since she lost her memory, so it wasn't unfamiliar to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed the doorbell, but there was no answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she could see the lights on inside the house from outside, so Chandler should be in the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he refusing to open the door because he knew it was her outside?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought, a bitterness welled up in Tina's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should I do? Should I continue ringing the doorbell? Or...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she faintly heard a hoarse roar coming from inside the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then it disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if the roar she had just heard was just an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a wave of unease surged in Tina's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitating for a moment, she placed her thumb on the fingerprint recognition of the keypad lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Chandler hasn't reset the password lock...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ding! The lock made a sound, indicating that it was unlocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina breathed a sigh of relief. Luckily, Chandler hadn't reset the password lock, and her fingerprint still worked to open the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed into the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she entered, the suppressed roar became clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is that Chandler's voice?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded like he was desperately suppressing something, as if in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lights in the house were on, but she couldn't see Chandler anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where could he be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She searched for Chandler room by room, and when she reached the third floor of the villa, she suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound seemed to be coming from this floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't been to the third floor when she came to the villa before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had asked him what rooms were on the third floor, and he had casually said they were just storage for some old items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> is he on the third floor now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina hurriedly climbed the stairs, heading towards where the sound was coming from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she stopped at the doorway of one of the rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's voice was coming from this room!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she placed her hand on the doorknob of the room, there was a moment of hesitation, as if opening the door would change something, and make things different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a forbidden door that flashed before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God, what is she thinking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't help but make fun of herself, and then she forcefully turned the knob and pushed the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roaring sound suddenly became incredibly clear, and everything that came into view made Tina freeze in the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everywhere she could see upon opening the door were her photos, big and small, in all kinds of poses, hanging on the walls, while Chandler was lying on the ground, curled up, his hands clawing at the floor, emitting pained and suppressed roars from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he was engulfed in extreme agony at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth is going on?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was shocked, and Chandler, who was originally lying on the ground, seemed to sense something and suddenly struggled to raise his head, crawling towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His once handsome face was now contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina... Tina..." he repeatedly called out her name, his eyes fixed on her without moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood still in place until a force suddenly pulled her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she snapped out of her daze, she found herself tightly embraced by him!</span></p></div>
