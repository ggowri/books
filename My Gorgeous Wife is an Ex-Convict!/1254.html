        <h1>Chapter 1253</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the situation that seemed to be on the verge of a dispute... suddenly turned into... a loving scene?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Stella's eyes widened in disbelief. 'Why... is Jason with Grace? Haven't they split up?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glared coldly at Stella who was pinned down by the female bodyguard. "Do you want me to help you deal with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke casually, but Stella was taken aback and said quickly, "Jason, don't... Don't be fooled by Grace. She's so crazy about Chase Harper right now that she even became his lawyer. She even stood in front of Brian's mansion all night for Chase Harper..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she just wanted to quickly drive a wedge between Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered as Stella's words reminded her of her most desperate night!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those nearby were shocked when Stella called out the name &lsquo;Jason&rsquo;. The two rich ladies who spoke ill of Grace to help Stella before were the first to recognize Jason. Therefore, they were both pale as they looked at each other and saw the fear in each other's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stopped rubbing Grace&rsquo;s hands and glanced coldly at Stella. "Who are you to slander my wife? Your mouth deserves a good slapping."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wife?' Stella was immediately dumbfounded!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When did Grace become Jason's wife? What... What's going on here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she knew it, one of the bodyguards who had followed Jason into the shop walked up to Stella. He raised his hand and slapped her in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the sound of slaps after slaps rang throughout the shop. Stella did not even have a chance to beg for mercy. Her mouth and cheeks were swollen from the slapping, and no one around dared stand up for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bodyguard finally stopped after some time. Stella struggled to trash-talk, "I'll ask Brian to get me justice for the way you&rsquo;re treating me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sneered. "An impostor should behave like an impostor, but you don&rsquo;t seem to be aware."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's pupils shrank immediately. 'Does... Jason also know something?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She heard Jason's cold and piercing voice in her ears again. "Pick up the dress on the ground. If you don't pick it up, I can guarantee that you'll never have the chance to do so again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella began to tremble uncontrollably, and her face was full of humiliation. Ever since she got her hands on Brian, she had been lauded and fawned over by others. She had never received such treatment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not to mention in front of so many people, including the two rich ladies she knew well. Needless to say, this incident would be spread all over high society afterward!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was worse was that Jason had called her an impostor in public! She dared not refute and had to pick Grace's dress up. It was like getting slapped countless more times!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a swollen and aggrieved-looking face, Stella squatted down as everyone watched. She picked up the dress and handed it to Grace. Then, she hurriedly ran away, not daring to stay for another minute or second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the dress in her hands. She carefully straightened it out and said to the staff nearby, "Please wrap up the dress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they got back to the car, Jason suddenly said, "Your cousin won't be able to be so full of herself for long. Brian is investigating the incident right now."</p></div>
