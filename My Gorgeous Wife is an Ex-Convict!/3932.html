        <h1>Chapter 3930</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... what she couldn't understand was why he was willing to do this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clearly, there was no benefit to him in this matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After getting into the car, Nancy looked at Mick and said, "Why did you help me? Mr. Reed, there doesn't seem to be any benefit for you to offend the Schultz family for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't you say that if Clarissa did anything to you, I wouldn't let her and the Schultz family off the hook?" Mick said with a smirk. "Since you said that, of course I have to follow through."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words were undoubtedly a sarcastic remark about her previous lies in front of Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's face flashed with embarrassment. "I'm sorry." She apologized straightforwardly. After all, this matter was originally her fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car was silent, and soon arrived at a vegetable market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy said thank you and got out of the car, walking towards the market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick sat in the back seat of the car, looking at the figure of the person walking into the market through the car window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where to now, young master?" The driver in the front row asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wait for now." Mick lazily said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver was stunned. Wait? Did the young master mean... to wait for the woman who just got out of the car?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't dare to ask anything and quietly followed his young master's orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's gaze was fixed through the car window as he looked outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today's encounter was once again by chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, he came to the hotel today to discuss a business matter, but unexpectedly saw Nancy again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was strange, he only heard the commotion at the hotel entrance and glanced over casually, but he saw Nancy at a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although this woman's appearance was ordinary at best, she could only be considered pretty, and in a crowd, she should have been lost in the crowd. But why did he see her at a glance?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could even see the swelling on her face clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only difference from before was that today, even with obvious swelling from being beaten, she was holding the other person's wrist and fighting back without flinching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And in her "counterattack" words, she even included him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it were another woman, speaking like this in his name outside, he should have been angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But hearing it from her, he didn't feel repulsed, but rather found it interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This woman was full of nonsense but still so confident, and her appearance was so different from before when she was beaten but remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helping her vent was just a small favor for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he was never the kind of person who was willing to do small favors for strangers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why was it different for Nancy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He even let her spend the night in his villa last time. Thinking of this, Mick's right index finger lightly tapped the edge of the car window, absentmindedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who know him well know that he is deep in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After about half an hour, the driver suddenly spoke up, "Young master, that young lady just came out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick looked up and saw Nancy walking out of the market with two large bags.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go and pick her up," he instructed the driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver agreed and quickly got out of the car, running over to Nancy. "Young master requests your presence in the car," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was taken aback and looked over at the black Bentley parked outside the market.</p></div>
