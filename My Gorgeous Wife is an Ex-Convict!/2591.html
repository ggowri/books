        <h1>Chapter 2589</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace returned to the Reed family&rsquo;s house, Jason was already at home. When she saw Jason, Grace could not help stepping forward and hugging him. She buried her face in his arms at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if being enveloped by his scent could make her feel grounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened?" Jason looked down and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told Kyla about Martin Weiss's second liver donation today," muttered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you tell her so soon? Didn't you say you'd wait a few days?" Jason asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When I went to see Trista today, Mrs. Corbyn said Kyla went to see Martin Weiss's attorney to sign the divorce papers, so I hurried over. Fortunately, Kyla hadn&rsquo;t signed it, and I told Kyla about Martin Weiss's liver donation," Grace told Jason in detail about what had happened today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know if Kyla will still choose to divorce Martin Weiss, but... she should at least have the right to know. And she should at least know what Martin Weiss has done for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla will probably go to L City to see Martin Weiss," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think she'll go too?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She&rsquo;ll go if she still loves Martin Weiss. By the way, how&rsquo;s the little one in your belly today? Did they cause you any trouble?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm alright. I didn't throw up much today. But Mason still seems unwilling to accept me when I picked him and Veronica up from school and sent them home," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only say that Mason did not reject her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't the psychologist say it's related to the child's childhood experience? In his case, it's difficult for him to truly trust someone. It'll be difficult for him to accept a person too," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Mason accepted Veronica. Veronica is probably the only person Mason trusts. Fortunately, he has Veronica. Without her, I don't know how Mason would&rsquo;ve turned out. Maybe no one could get close to him," Grace said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glimmered slightly. 'Fortunately?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it did not seem right to him. If the child trusted only one person, it was dangerous if one looked at it from another angle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a child grew, there would be many changes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether Veronica Barlow would be a curse or a blessing for Mason was unconfirmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take your time. Mason will trust us and accept us one day." Jason comforted his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." Grace nodded. Then, she looked down, raised her hand, and caressed her belly. "I&rsquo;ll take good care of the baby and not let them suffer any danger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sure you can protect the baby well," Jason said reassuringly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not repeat his mistakes. He would take good care of her and the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Kyla looked at her little daughter, who had fallen asleep once more in her arms. The little one looked smaller than the average full-term baby because she was born prematurel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was considered easy to take care of. She basically ate and slept all day. She would wail a little after waking up. Once she fed her, though, she would not make much noise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla placed the baby carefully in the crib and looked at the daughter she had almost given up her life to give birth to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she was only risking her life, but... Martin Weiss was the one who risked his life for the baby in the end.</p></div>
