        <h1>Chapter 3762</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything was done, Veronica turned her head and saw the little girl eating cake with a face covered in cream, just like a little kitten. Mason was sitting next to her, wiping the cream off the little girl's face with a tissue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was surprised because this was not something she expected Mason to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for some reason, this scene gave her a warm feeling, just like when she and Mason used to eat cake together and she would help him wipe the cream off his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she never thought that one day they might be separated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the little one finished eating the cake, Veronica and Mason took her to the police station. According to the police, the girl's parents had already contacted the police station and were on their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Veronica and Jasper waited together at the police station for the girl's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a man and a woman hurried over. The woman was wearing a dress in the same color as Veronica's. When the woman saw the little girl, she immediately choked up and hugged her, while the man kept thanking Veronica and Mason for bringing the girl to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family of three had to register at the police station. After that, Veronica and Mason left the police station. Veronica smiled and said, "Today's shopping trip was quite meaningful. We helped a little girl find her parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When a child goes missing, parents will worry like that, won't they?" Mason suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, they will worry a lot," Veronica said, looking at him intently. Did he think of his own childhood? At that time, he was also separated from his parents, which led him to end up with the Barlow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say anything else, just held her hand and continued walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day of the campus festival, Veronica heard her phone alarm and groggily reached out to her bedside table to find her phone with her eyes closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice spoke up, "Do you want me to help you turn off the alarm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, yes...thank you..." she mumbled in response. Suddenly, she jolted awake and opened her eyes to see a figure standing by her bed, holding her phone and turning off </span><span>the alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason?!" Veronica exclaimed in surprise. "How...how did you get here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I say I would drive you to the campus festival at Stanford University today? But if you're still tired, you can sleep a little longer. It doesn't make much of a difference whether we go early or late," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to sleep anymore, I...I'll get up now!" Veronica quickly replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hurriedly got up and went into the bathroom, looking at herself in the mirror with a flushed face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did it seem like she always blushed and her heart raced in front of him since they reunited? They used to live together and had seen each other wake up countless times, so why was she so shy now that he saw her like this?!</span></p></div>
