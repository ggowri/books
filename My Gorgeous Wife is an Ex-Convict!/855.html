        <h1>Chapter 854</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then&hellip; Where's your brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he said this, she stiffened. The word &lsquo;brother&rsquo; once felt so close to her, but now it felt so far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He&hellip; has gone back to his own home. I was only taking him in temporarily," muttered Grace. She then returned to her seat, lowered her head, and began to eat her unfinished meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper only stared at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is the 'brother' who at first seemed to be monopolizing her no longer with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she alone now? Does that mean I... have a chance?' The idea grew stronger and stronger in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neither of the two in the restaurant noticed a black sedan parked a short distance from the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man in the car was staring at them through the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence did not even dare to breathe. He just looked at his boss who was in front of him in fear before looking at Grace and the man called Chase Harper in the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finding out Grace's current location, Master Reed just made him drive over, and... he just kept watching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When is he gonna stop?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence just wished Grace and the man could finish their meal soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After lunch, Grace had to go back to the law firm. Chase Harper insisted on driving Grace there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have something to do anyway. We're heading in the same direction, so I can drop you off," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you&hellip; then," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Chase Harper asked about the case and the possibility of Baldwin getting compensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's little chance," Grace hesitated but still answered, "According to what I've been able to find out so far, the perpetrator has already transferred all their assets. They don't have any assets in their name, and the assets that were transferred have all been re-transferred. Unless we can now find out what else is in their name, we're just going to win the case without getting any money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can such a person exist? She hurt a living person!" Chase Harper said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are many such people in the world," said Grace. The selfishness of human nature was sometimes unimaginably evil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like the reason she was imprisoned. It was because the witnesses who testified against her were easily bribed to fabricate facts for money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those people only cared about money. They never thought that the people they testified against would be unjustly imprisoned and would suffer for nothing while getting their lives ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper seemed to have also thought about Grace's imprisonment. "If only... I had known you earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Maybe I could have been of some help. Maybe... you wouldn't have to suffer so much," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. Chase Harper was a simple man. Although he was older than her, his social circle kept him from seeing much of the dark side of the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you knew me then, it wouldn't change anything," she said. Though it may be a blow to his good intentions, she did not want him to have any affection for her.</p></div>
