        <h1>Chapter 918</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If that's the case, I'll help you out. Anyway, be prepared for it, but don't be too pessimistic," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Grace," Kyla said gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not for Grace, she would have no idea what to do and might not even be able to get away from Martin Weiss until now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace left Kyla with a heavy heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not tell Kyla that Martin Weiss would have a good chance of winning if he were to fight for custody.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Kyla led an unstable life and was an ex-convict while Martin Weiss was a famous entrepreneur in S city. He did not seem to have any tainted history and was reputable. He could provide the child a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, there were also rumors that Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels were going to get married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A normal family was far more advantageous than a single-parent family. All these would put Kyla at a disadvantage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What can I do to help Kyla solve her current predicament?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was worried, and before she knew it, she had reached the door of her rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she opened the door, she saw Jason in the house again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was sitting in a chair with the legal case books she had recently bought in his hands. He looked up at her and asked, "What's the matter? You don't want me here, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. Didn't you say... you wouldn't live here for a while and give me some time to get used to it?" she said, biting her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, that's why I'm only here to see you." As he spoke, he closed the book he was holding and walked over to her. "Were you at Kyla's?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she replied, not surprised at why he was able to guess that she had gone to Kyla's. After all, he had ways of knowing where she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You seem to care about her a lot." He gave a little groan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla helped me a lot," she said. Perhaps she had seen too much of human nature in prison, so she cherished the warmth that was hard to come by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I helped you a lot too. Do you care about me?" he said as he brushed away the hair on her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stiffened a little. "There are a lot of people who care about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if the concern of thousands of people doesn&rsquo;t matter as much as yours?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned her head away uncomfortably, not wanting to meet his eyes. "You think too highly of me. My concern is nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When I say your concern matters, then it matters." All he wanted was her attention!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, his finger grabbed her jaw, forcing her to look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to care about him. He wanted her to smile at him like she used to. He wanted her to see only him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such thoughts had gotten stronger and stronger these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At last, she was with him again. However, even though she promised to become his sister again, it seemed that there was still a gap between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you think my concern matters so much, then why did you break up with me in the first place?" Grace blurted out as if she could not resist the urge to do so. "Don't you think your words and your actions contradict each other sometimes?"</p></div>
