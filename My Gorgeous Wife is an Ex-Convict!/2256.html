        <h1>Chapter 2254</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she had her head down, she could not see what his fingers were doing, but this made her all the more nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Kyla could not explain what she was nervous about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's fingers gently detangled her hair from the clasp. He was even vaguely grateful to the person who came up with the idea of wearing costumes. Otherwise, her hair would not have gotten caught in the clasp and he would not have gotten the chance to get so openly close to her. She would not have quietly stood still as he pressed against her either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like the old days. She used to lean into his arms and speak in a soft, coquettish voice, "Martin, you know what? Your arms feel so safe. It's as if I have nothing to be afraid of when I'm in your arms. Even if the sky falls, you&rsquo;ll hold it up for me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was the one who made her world collapse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he could not give her any sense of security. All he could give her was fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes darkened at the thought of this, and he quickly worked with his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every extra second might be a blessing for him, but it was probably a burden to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her hair finally separated from the clasp, Martin Weiss backed away without a trace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his lips together and muttered, "You and Nelson are going to walk around the school, right? I&rsquo;ll leave first, then.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze slightly. "Do you have something else to do?" If it was before, she would not have asked this question but replied, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; However, she could not help asking that today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, but... you'll probably feel uncomfortable if I were to walk around with you guys," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's just walk around the school together. Nelson's having fun today," said Kyla. She could tell that her son was in a good mood today. Besides... her son must want to spend some time with Martin Weiss too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Martin Weiss. Even though&hellip; she only said that because of their son, it would be nice to be around her a little longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three walked out of Nelson's classroom and began visiting the other classrooms. Martin Weiss also bought some food from the other classes for Nelson and Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was tall and handsome, Nelson was good-looking and elegant, and Kyla was demure and gentle. The three of them were a sight for sore eyes as they walked together, and they caught many people's attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they passed by the door of one classroom, they realized it was almost completely blocked by onlooking parents and students.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at the theme posted on the classroom door. It was a Year 1 classroom that was holding an ordinary charity bazaar. Unused toys and books were put up for charity sale here so that kids could be more money-conscious. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;They&rsquo;re just selling used toys and books. Is there anything worth seeing?' Kyla was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, Nelson Corbyn solved her confusion. "Mommy, this is Veronica Barlow and Mason's classroom. Godfather and Godmother are probably here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla instantly realized what was going on after her son reminded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, one of the triplets, Mason, started school early and insisted on being in the same class as his sister from the He family.</p></div>
