        <h1>Chapter 1182</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? Which one did you play with?" Chase Harper opened his bag and showed Grace the Transformers toys in it as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a look. These were not just a few. There were a ton of them! There were at least a dozen at a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found the same toy she had played with last time&mdash;Bumblebee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This was what I had," said Grace as she looked at the Bumblebee in her hand. A touch of nostalgia flashed across her almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can have it then," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But aren&rsquo;t these for Nelson?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are so many more for Nelson. He won't miss this one. You can keep this one as a souvenir," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Souvenir...' Grace looked at the Bumblebee in her hands. She had begged her grandmother for this toy for so long. She had no concept of money back then, and she had no idea that her grandmother had used the money she normally saved to buy it for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart softened as she thought of her grandmother. "Thank you," she said with a chuckle and accepted the Bumblebee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper smiled after seeing that she was willing to take it. Even though he knew they could never get together, he was happy inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They smiled at each other, unaware of the eyes that were peering down from the floor of the inpatient ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was in Brian's ward when Grace got there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw Stella almost every time she came. However, Stella would look at her with some joy as if she was rejoicing in other people's misfortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you seemed to be having a good time chatting with a guy downstairs today. Who was that man? Your friend? Did he bring you here today?" said Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave her a faint glance. "Just a former colleague who coincidentally ran into me at the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a coincidence..." Stella deliberately dragged out the words, giving people the impression that there was something ambiguous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what are you trying to say?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No-Nothing. I just thought you and your colleague seemed close," said Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace snapped. "Do my former colleagues and I have to act like we dislike each other, ignore each other, or bash each other? I wonder how you greet your classmates from school, your co-stars, and film crew members when you meet them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was immediately speechless and could only shyly stop speaking, but a hint of malice still flashed across her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not bother to pay attention to Stella either. She turned to Brian and asked, "Are you feeling better?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Yes. I can get out of bed and walk now. Can you peel me another apple?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," said Grace. The nearby Stella also quickly said, "Brian, why don't I peel the apple for you? Let Grace rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stella, go and check if my test report has come out," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'You can just ring the bell for the nurse!' thought Stella. He was making it clear that he wanted to get her out of the room and be alone with Grace.</p></div>
