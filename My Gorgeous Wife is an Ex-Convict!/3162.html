        <h1>Chapter 3160</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he lost that past relationship, he knows very clearly that he really wanted to live with her at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, finally achieving it, but then becoming afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I'm afraid that this happy time will be too short. I'm afraid that she might unintentionally say something that could cause trouble between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, he even secretly mocked himself, wondering why he had made the secret language setting related to her in the first place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The phrase that will release him from hypnosis must be spoken by her own mouth in order to be effective!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, he probably wanted to hear her say those words, but now he's afraid she'll say them and disrupt their peaceful life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, his phone rang and he picked it up to see that it was his mother calling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, what's up?" He answered the phone and spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You haven't slept yet?" The voice of old Mrs. Weiss came from the other end of the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, not yet," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you planning to settle down in Emerald City? You've been staying there and not planning to come back?" old Mrs. Weiss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Martin remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You and Kyla are not suitable for each other. I've been watching you two struggle for so many years, and I feel tired. Kyla's two children can be recognized by the Weiss family and can be listed on the Weiss family's genealogy, but I hope you can come back. Before, you lived together for the image of the group, but now that the storm has passed for a long time, you can come back first, spend some time, and then formally divorce Kyla and issue a divorce statement. In the future, whatever kind of lady you want, Mom will find for you." old Mrs. Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he heard the word "divorce," Martin suddenly shook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Divorce...yes, he and Kyla almost got divorced before. Kyla's signed divorce agreement was still with him. As long as he signed it, it would take effect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't go and sign that word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because at that time - he didn't want to get divorced!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mum, I won't divorce Kyla," Martin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean?" The old Mrs. Weiss on the other end of the phone was surprised. "You're not getting a divorce from Kyla, are you planning to spend the rest of your life with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mum, I was supposed to spend my whole life with her. It's just that too many things have happened between us, causing so many twists and turns. Half of my life has passed, and I don't think I can find another woman who loves me like she does," Martin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old Mrs. Weiss was silent for a while before saying, "What about Kyla? Does she really want to be with you? Don't forget, she signed the divorce agreement!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know she signed the divorce agreement, but I... don't want to let go," Martin murmured. "Mum, if you want me to be happy in the future, then I hope she won't leave me. No matter what happens, I won't leave her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old Mrs. Weiss didn't reply for a while before saying, "I can't control your affairs anymore, and I won't interfere with you and her. Anyway, you're my son, and as a mother, I just hope you can live a good life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old Mrs. Weiss's voice was filled with exhaustion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had complicated feelings towards Kyla, after so many years of right and wrong, it was already unclear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if her son was really destined to be with Kyla, then even if she was unwilling, she would still accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she didn't want her only son to live in pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Mom," said Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ending the call, he finally picked up a pen and wrote a line on a blank piece of paper. He carefully folded the paper and stayed in the study for a long time before finally leaving.</p></div>
