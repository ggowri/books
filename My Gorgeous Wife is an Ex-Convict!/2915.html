        <h1>Chapter 2913</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The red wine splashed directly onto Brian Hart's body, and Barbara Schuman's empty wine glass also fell to the ground due to the shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman couldn't believe her eyes as she looked at Brian Hart who suddenly appeared!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was going on? Brian Hart... was actually protecting Valda Theller. Wasn't Brian Hart supposed to be indifferent to Valda Theller? During the comic convention, Valda Theller was clearly seriously injured, but wasn't Brian Hart also indifferent?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Brian Hart nervously looked at the person in his arms. After confirming that the person was okay, he looked coldly at Barbara Schuman and said, "I don't want to see you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He then lowered his head and said to Valda Theller, "Let me take you home." He took her hand and walked directly towards the exit of the banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller followed Brian Hart out, and it wasn't until they reached the door that she came back to her senses from the cold wind outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for earlier, I'm sorry that your clothes got wet, I..." She opened her mouth, intending to offer to pay for his dry cleaning, but the words were stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Offering to pay for Brian Hart's dry cleaning sounded a bit ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can go home by myself," she said, trying to pull her hand out of his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take you home. I don't feel comfortable letting you go alone," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need, if you take me home now, I'll feel uncomfortable. So, I'll go by myself." Valda Theller said again, and this time, she finally managed to pull her hand out of his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hailed a taxi and got in. As the car drove towards her home, Valda Theller closed her eyes and thought about what had happened at the banquet today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's apology and the revelation of the truth were too late, and the pain she had endured could not disappear because of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Raymond Bowman's actions had also made the depression in her heart fade away little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the voice of the taxi driver came from the front, "Miss, do you know the Porsche behind us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was stunned and opened her eyes to look at the rearview mirror. She saw a Porsche following the taxi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was... Brian Hart's car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This car has been following us since you got in. Do you know the person?" the driver asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes... I know him. Don't worry," Valda Theller said, feeling a bit dry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is he your boyfriend? Did you have a fight?" the driver asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller almost choked on her saliva. "Why... why do you ask that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Couples usually fight. If the woman doesn't want to get in the man's car, she takes a taxi. It's not common for the man to follow in his car like this. Your boyfriend must care about you a lot. You should make up with him soon," the driver said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He... he's not my boyfriend," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not your boyfriend? Then he must be interested in you, otherwise why would he follow you like this?" the driver said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller didn't say anything else, but her gaze kept flickering towards the rearview mirror. The Porsche had been following them all the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the taxi arrived at the entrance of Valda Theller's residential area and stopped, she got out of the car and saw the Porsche also parked at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller sighed and walked to the front of the Porsche. Brian Hart opened the car door and got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm home now. You don't have to follow me like this," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really hate me that much? Even following you in my car makes you uncomfortable?" Brian Hart asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not that I hate you, it's just that... it's not necessary." Valda Theller took a deep breath and said, "Brian Hart, it took me a lot of courage to make up my mind to break up with you. This is my decision, and I hope you can respect it. Besides, I'm just an ordinary person, not worth your persistent pursuit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her phoenix eyes narrowed, "Do you think I'm being persistent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She didn't say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He laughed self-deprecatingly, "Indeed, I'm being persistent now, just like a pest. But Valda Theller..." His tone changed, and he looked straight at her, "Do you really think breaking up with me is what you want? Besides me, do you think you will fall in love with someone else in the future? Raymond Bowman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was taken aback and couldn't help but think of the scene where she saw Raymond Bowman today. One time was at the end of the corridor, and the other was at the banquet, where he revealed the truth in front of everyone and cleared her name.</p></div>
