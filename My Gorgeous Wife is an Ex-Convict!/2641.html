        <h1>Chapter 2639</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After chatting for a while, Camille Strickland said, "By the way, remember to attend the booting ceremony in three days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it," answered Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Remember to buy a nice outfit and dress up for that day. Don't come without dressing up. There&rsquo;ll be a lot of reporters at the booting ceremony. They&rsquo;ll probably include you in their shots."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, okay, got it. I&rsquo;ll dress up for the booting ceremony!" replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was on a date with Brian the next day, Valda Theller said, "Can you go shopping with me? I want to buy a new outfit for the booting ceremony."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Which shopping mall do you want to go to?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe we should go to Harbour Building downtown. There are more boutiques there," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." Brian started the car and drove toward Harbour Building. On the way, he asked, "Is the drama starting so soon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not really. We've been preparing this for some time. We just hadn't decided on the male lead, but Gloria has agreed to take the role this time. He happens to be free right now, so we hurriedly started filming." Valda Theller could not help but sigh again as she mentioned this. "It's just like what you said the other day. He's starring in the adaptation. According to Camille, he almost rejected but agreed afterward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille? Your friend?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "Yes, Camille Strickland. She&rsquo;s the editor for my comics as well as my friend. She was the friend on a blind date you met at the restaurant that day. Camille's very kind to me. She&rsquo;s the only one who believed in me, stood by me, and helped me when I was alone and bullied. Without Camille's help, I probably wouldn't be where I am now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have a good friend," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Camille's really good!" She was lucky to have a friend like Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to the mall, and the two got out. They went up to the second floor and shopped for women's clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it bore you to look at women's clothes with me like this?" Valda Theller asked. After all, men generally did not seem to like shopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not boring. At least I get to learn some of your preferences through shopping," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pressed her lips together. 'Does he want to learn my preferences so we'll look more like... a couple to others?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chose me as his girlfriend because she once said she could withdraw her feelings for someone even if she fell for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, Valda Theller's heart filled with bitterness that even she could not explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two shopped around. Valda Theller took a fancy to a dress in a women's boutique. The same dress came in two colors&mdash;pastel purple and mint green.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said to the shop assistant, "Do you have it in purple and size M? I'd like to try it on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," the shop assistant responded. She was about to look for the purple dress in size M when Brian's voice suddenly rang out. "Let's go with mint green."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Brian in confusion. Brian looked away uneasily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll take mint green, then," Valda Theller said to the shop assistant.</p></div>
