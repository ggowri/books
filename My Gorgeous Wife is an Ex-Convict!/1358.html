        <h1>Chapter 1357</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elevator doors slowly began to close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin!" shouted Paisley Daniels. She reached out, seemingly to press the open button to stop the elevator doors from closing so quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Kyla Corbyn's trembling body and suddenly said to Paisley Daniels, "Go upstairs first and wait for me there. I'll come later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Paisley Daniels was surprised, and her fingers stopped in mid-air. She did not even manage to press the button to open the elevator doors. She just watched the elevator doors close, cutting off the scene in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's heart surged with uneasiness. The last scene she saw was of Martin looking at Kyla Corbyn, and there was floundering hesitation in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is he floundering? What is he hesitating about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even though it has been more than four years, does Kyla Corbyn still hold enough importance in his heart?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels clenched her teeth in hatred. 'Why can't this woman die sooner? I can only be at ease when she's dead!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Martin Weiss, who was standing in front of the elevator, was surprised that the sight of her trembling body and her telling him to wait was enough to make him stay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What the hell do you want to say? Hurry and say it!" He jerked his arm away from her fingers, not wanting her to affect his mood again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "I hope you can take some time off to bring Nelson to an amusement park with me sometime soon. He has never been to an amusement park with his parents since he was born. I want to give him a beautiful memory."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A beautiful memory?" Martin Weiss sneered, "Kyla Corbyn, do you think me accompanying him to the amusement park with you will give him a beautiful memory? What's the matter? Do you really want to use your son to play hard to get? Are you still after the position of the mistress of the Weiss family?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him. There was hope and calmness on her face, but there was no guilt and anger from being hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words could no longer hurt her. She only wanted to know if he was willing to accompany his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you spend just one day with Nelson?" she insisted on asking. All his humiliations were just water under the bridge to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glared at her, her reaction making him a little uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was just a prop to make her son happy and nothing else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you asking me to spend one day with Nelson? I'll have plenty of time to spend with Nelson when the time comes. Kyla Corbyn, is life too hard for you so you want to approach me in this way? What about the man you're going to start a new life with? Has he turned his back on you? Or do you want more than he can give?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss continued to make mean remarks to erase his discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what can I do to make you agree to accompany Nelson to the amusement park with me?" she asked, not attempting to explain what he misunderstood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather, they already had too many misunderstandings between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before, she would have struggled to explain, wanting him to understand the truth. However, she was now tired and did not want to bother with it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had plenty of time to spend with Nelson, but... she was running out of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her and suddenly said, "If you really want me to agree, then go to Paisley and admit that you were the one who harmed her. Apologize to her face! You&rsquo;ve owed her this apology for four years. It's time you give it to her!"</p></div>
