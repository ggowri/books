        <h1>Chapter 3723</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment, the screen was showing an intimate scene between the male and female leads. They were kissing, and the female lead had her hands around the male lead's neck. They walked from the living room to the bedroom, kissing all the way, and the scene made people blush and their hearts race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come on! This TV drama doesn't have much romance, right? How come it's so steamy all of a sudden!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she were alone, she could slowly enjoy watching it, but with him next to her, it was just awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Veronica could only pray in her heart that this intimate scene would pass quickly. But unfortunately, after the female lead kissed the male lead all the way to the bedroom, the camera didn't cut to the next morning. Instead, the two of them started rolling around in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica didn't know what to say anymore. Who knows how long this will take? Right now, she just felt like she was sitting on pins and needles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um...how about we change the channel?" She said awkwardly, reaching for the TV remote.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before her hand could touch the remote, he stopped her. "There's no need to change the channel. It's just some intimate scenes. Are you feeling embarrassed?" He asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um...a little bit," she said, feeling embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even if the performance is intimate, it's fake, isn't it? So what's there to be embarrassed about?" He asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's true, but it's still embarrassing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at Mason. It seemed like he had always been like this, his way of receiving emotions was different from ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?" He asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just feel like you might lack a certain sense of empathy," she murmured. "Because even though we know it's fake and acting, when we watch TV dramas, our emotions will follow the protagonist's emotions and the development of the story. When we see this kind of plot, most people will naturally feel embarrassed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really don't think that just a simple physical touch like this would be embarrassing," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was speechless. Did he need even more explicit scenes to feel embarrassed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because you haven't met someone you like. If it were in real life and the person you like did this to you, you would also feel embarrassed," Veronica said, relieved that the TV scene had finally ended and the plot had returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Real life?" he pondered, staring at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she felt a sense of unease rising in her heart. The next moment, that unease became a reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you want to do this kind of thing to me?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem!" She felt like she was choking on her own saliva. Okay, he was always so shocking and unpredictable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, absolutely not!" she hurriedly denied. "How could I want to do this kind of thing to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you say you liked me?" he said. "Or was that a lie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She froze. "I...I haven't figured out what kind of liking I have for you yet. Besides, you don't like it when others do this kind of thing to you, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're trying to date now, aren't we? So doing this kind of thing isn't a big deal. Moreover, since you can't figure out what kind of liking you have for me, isn't it a good opportunity for you to clarify what your liking for me really is?" he said calmly.</span></p></div>
