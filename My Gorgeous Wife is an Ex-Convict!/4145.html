        <h1>Chapter 4143</h1>
        <div><p>In the end, Chandler brings Kit to his villa, where the Hunter family&#x27;s private doctor examines Kit&#x27;s injuries.</p><p>Fortunately, these injuries are only superficial, not serious.</p><p>&quot;However, the bruising on the face will take at least a week to fully fade,&quot; the doctor says.</p><p>&quot;Can&#x27;t it heal faster?&quot; Tina interjects, considering that Kit is a celebrity and still has a film to shoot. If fans see the injuries on his face, it will definitely lead to negative speculation.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s difficult. When I say a week, it&#x27;s already the fastest time,&quot; the doctor explains.</p><p> Kit, less concerned than Tina, says, &quot;It&#x27;s okay, these injuries can be covered up with makeup. They won&#x27;t be noticeable from a distance.&quot;</p><p> His casual remark catches Tina off guard, &quot;Do you often get injured? </p><p> &quot;What?&quot; he looks at her, raising an eyebrow.</p><p> &quot;Um, I was just wondering if you... are used to covering up wounds with makeup?&quot; she says.</p><p> &quot;Being an idol, it&#x27;s a common thing,&quot; he says nonchalantly.</p><p> Tina tightly purses her lips, suddenly feeling a bit uncomfortable. </p><p> She always thought Kit was glamorous, even if he worked hard and struggled for his dreams.</p><p> It&#x27;s true that injuries are not uncommon for idol stars like him, maybe from dancing or acting... but she never imagined he would be injured like this.</p><p> What about before? Has he experienced situations like this? How many times has he gone through this?</p><p> The doctor gave Kit some ointment for external use and left.</p><p> Kit stood up and said to Chandler, &quot;Thanks for today. I just called my agent and he will be here to pick me up soon.&quot;</p><p> Tina opened her mouth to speak but didn&#x27;t know what to say.</p><p> &quot;Thank you for today,&quot; Kit said, looking at her and then glancing at Chandler. &quot;But I hope what happened today can be kept confidential.&quot;</p><p> &quot;Of course, it will be kept confidential,&quot; Tina quickly replied.</p><p> Shortly after, Kit&#x27;s agent arrived. After they left, Tina suddenly hugged Chandler and buried her head in his chest.</p><p> &quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; Chandler asked, looking down at the person in his arms.</p><p> &quot;I just feel really sad,&quot; Tina whispered.</p><p> &quot;Because of what happened to Kit today?&quot; he asked. </p><p> &quot;Yes.&quot; In fact, what disgusted her more than Mr. Perkins&#x27; vile actions towards Kit was... From Mr. Perkins&#x27; words, she could tell that all of this was somehow connected to Kit&#x27;s father.</p><p> How could a father do such things? How could he push his own child into this situation just for resources!</p><p> &quot;Do you sympathize with him?&quot; Chandler asked again.</p><p> &quot;I do sympathize, but I also want to help him, at least to ensure he won&#x27;t encounter these things again in the future,&quot; she said.</p><p> &quot;But don&#x27;t you think that by doing this, you&#x27;re going beyond what a fan should do?&quot; Chandler&#x27;s eyes flickered slightly. &quot;Didn&#x27;t you just say that you wanted to be a well-behaved fan?&quot; </p><p>She looked up abruptly. &quot;But-&quot;</p><p>He interrupted her. &quot;If you help him today, and tomorrow he encounters something else, are you going to continue helping him? Until when do you plan to help him? For a lifetime?&quot; </p><p>Tina paused, not knowing how to refute his words.</p><p>&quot;Tina...&quot; Chandler sighed, gently brushing his fingers against her cheek. &quot;Do you really see him only as an idol you like?&quot; </p></div>
