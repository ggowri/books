        <h1>Chapter 1728</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since you're already up, go wash up. I've put a fresh set of clothes in the bathroom. Come out for breakfast when you're ready," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His clear voice pulled her back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But... last night, why... Why was I..." stammered Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at Lina with a sarcastic smirk. "You always forget what happens after getting drunk, so did you forget what you did last night as well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina bit her lower lip as her round eyes stared at him. She looked somewhat pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Would you believe me if I told you that I was going to take you home last night but you put yourself on top of me, kissed me, and made a bunch of promises to me just like you used to back then?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No way!" she blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes gazed at her as he walked to the bedside and bent over. Their faces suddenly became very close to each other. "Why? Do you think you wouldn&rsquo;t have put yourself on top of me and made those promises to me?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, you're a liar!" His thin lips gently spat out those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her face paled and her heart ached because of what he said. "I... I was drunk last night. I don&rsquo;t remember what I did or said. Well... I can only apologize now. I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, she quickly got out of bed and fled into the bathroom attached to the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She slammed the sliding door shut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes fell on the door, his face looking grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the bathroom, Lina heaved a long breath and supported her hands on the sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Last night... Did I really do what Hadwin Stephenson said? Gosh! How did that happen? How could I do that to Hadwin Stephenson?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I should be staying away from him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She tried to recall but her efforts were to no avail. The more she tried, the more her head hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at herself in the mirror in front of the sink. Her comely face had paled but her cheeks were still blushing. Her eyes were full of panic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Lina walked out of the bathroom, Hadwin Stephenson was not in the bedroom, which made her relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could not find the clothes she had worn last night in the room. The clothes Hadwin Stephenson had prepared fit her, but the price tags... were worth years of her salary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she had nothing else to wear but those clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her bag was still there and she pulled out her phone. There were several messages on her phone, all from Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina hurriedly called Grace. "Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, are you okay? Did anything happen last night?" Grace asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was ashamed to tell her that &lsquo;something&rsquo; had actually happened!</p></div>
