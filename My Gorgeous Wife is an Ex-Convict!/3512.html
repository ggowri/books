        <h1>Chapter 3510</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, even Veronica's so-called closest person is just like this," he spoke in a cold voice, slowly and mechanically, without any emotion. As he looked at her, his gaze became indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To Veronica, this kind of Mason was extremely unfamiliar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought the closest person would have no secrets, instead of doing such terrible things behind the scenes! You keep saying that I am your closest person, but you only use me as a pawn to manipulate! Although the kidnapping case was planned by you and Lionel, I still have to be grateful to you in the end!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she thanked him like a fool and depended on him, was he happy that his plan succeeded? Thinking of this, Veronica felt even more uncomfortable in her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He listened to her every accusation without defending himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turns out that not being trusted by the most important person in your life is incredibly painful! What kind of heart-wrenching feeling is this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I forgot that we are not even in the same league. You are Mason from the high and mighty Reed family, and to you, I am just a toy that you wanted..." Her voice continued to ring in his ears. "Even if you call me Veronica, do you really see me as Veronica?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice felt like the sharpest arrow, piercing his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then...what am I to Veronica?" He looked at her and said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt a sudden suffocation as his gaze seemed to press heavily on her chest. However, she chose to ignore this feeling and reminded herself that they were never meant to be equals, as their social status was vastly different. "To me, you're just Mason of the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Reed family's Mason?" He suddenly sneered, his eyes growing even colder and more indifferent. "So, to you, I'm just Mason of the Reed family? Is that the only reason why you're nice to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!" The words came out against her will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even she couldn't explain why she said "yes". Was it because she was angry? Angry that he was treating her like a fool?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see." He murmured, even though he had previously said that she could use him and he didn't mind being used by her. In fact, she could use his status to gain any benefits she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when she found out that her kindness towards him was only because of his status, the feeling of pain became even stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So...I won't call you Veronica anymore." He looked at her and said each word slowly, "Veronica, since you don't consider us to be the same kind of people and have never treated me as your closest person, then...I won't treat you as my closest person either. From now on, just like you said, I am only Mason, the Reed family's Mr. Mason!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was calm, but terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those beautiful black eyes looked at her with indifference and coldness, as if from now on, she was just like any other person in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her heart felt like it was stabbed heavily, causing a sharp pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future... will he not call her Veronica anymore? This sentence seems to be stripping away the relationship between them.</p></div>
