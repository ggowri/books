        <h1>Chapter 873</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. She unconsciously staggered when she tried to walk, but an arm wrapped itself around her waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Jason's voice rang in her ear. "What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head and stared blankly at the face before hers. Then, she looked at the two strangers who had been subdued. She immediately came back to her senses. "I don't know them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned. "You don't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she said, then she looked at him and said, &ldquo;What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came to see you." As he spoke, he glanced at one of the men who was lying on the ground screaming before looking at her again. "This man said he's your boyfriend. Is he your boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a sense of danger in his deep voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you, I don't know them. How can this person be my boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled. "Right. That question was unnecessary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he went to the man lying on the ground and put a foot on the man's chest, causing him to cry out loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are things you shouldn't say. Her boyfriend? You're not good enough!" His cold voice carried a bloodthirsty tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man almost fainted from the pain. He shouted with all his strength, "I... I'm not, I'm not. It's just a joke. I'm not her boyfriend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at Jason. The way he looked reminded her of how he had saved her on their first meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was just as ruthless then as he was now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not seem to care about anything back then, not even his own life or death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he cared about a joke. It was as if it was intolerable for him when someone joked that he was her boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the man had no more strength to shout, Jason said to his men, "Go and find out what's going on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," his men answered, quickly taking the two men away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked back to Grace. "Did they hurt you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." She shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He saw a few red scratches on the back of her hand. He then took her hand, asking, "Did they do this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She squirmed her hand uneasily, trying to pull it back. "It's just a few scratches. It's nothing serious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly stiffened when he lowered his head and his lips touched the red scratches on the back of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips kissed the red marks again and again. Even a few red marks made him feel distressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt the back of her hand where he had kissed her burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You always make me worry. You're always so vulnerable," he muttered, his deep and cold voice making her shudder before she gradually calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and he should never have been so close. Even if he had saved her today&hellip; "Mr. Reed, thank you for saving me today. I'm going home now."</p></div>
