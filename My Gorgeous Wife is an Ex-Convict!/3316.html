        <h1>Chapter 3314</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was suddenly at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Old Mrs. Hart felt even more certain that she had guessed correctly. "Alright, I'm warning you. Don't behave like this again. If something really happens, I'll teach you a lesson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian could only nod helplessly and endure his mother's scolding for a while before returning to his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Brian's return and curiously asked, "What did Mom ask you when she called you out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She told me to hold back," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because we were in the room for half an hour looking for something, and my mom thought I couldn't hold back and forced you to confess," Brian explained further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda finally understood, but her face turned red as a result.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then...did you explain to Mom what really happened?" she quickly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How do I explain? Tell her that you felt like crying just now?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly felt a bit embarrassed, as if she couldn't do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, it doesn't matter what they think," said Brian indifferently. He has never really cared about other people's opinions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But...if I do that, will my mother-in-law think that I...um, did something reckless for temporary pleasure and ignored my health?" Valda hesitated to say, as she didn't want to leave a bad impression on her mother-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't, my mom will only think that I forced you and you couldn't resist, so you had to comply," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda suddenly didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well...I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, you've made me feel wronged. So, how are you going to compensate me?" Brian leaned forward, placing his hands on both sides of Valda's body. His handsome face suddenly appeared larger in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blushed and leaned in to give Brian's thin lips a kiss. "Is this enough to make up for it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's eyes flickered with a hint of heat, and his voice sounded a bit hoarse as he said, "Let's leave it at that for now. The rest, you can make it up to me properly after you give birth to our child in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I know..." Her face was burning up, almost on fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After giving birth, she felt like she had to make it up to him...in many ways...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the sound of fireworks outside could be heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian smiled slightly, "Mrs. Hart, Happy New Year!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face was flushed, her round eyes meeting his gentle gaze. "Mr. Hart, Happy New Year!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the third day of the new year, Grace brought her four children to visit Valda and Brian, and the villa suddenly became lively again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Grace's four children enviously, "I wonder when I'll have four children too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you planning on having four?" Grace asked Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda chuckled awkwardly, although she did want to, but considering her age, it probably wasn't realistic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't have four, but at least two," she said, imagining the scene of two soft and tender children calling her mommy, and Valda's heart swelled with emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After you give birth to this one, you'll have to keep trying," Grace joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, did something happen to Jasper?" Valda asked. Among her children, Jasper was usually the most lively and outgoing, and her little mouth never stopped chattering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But today, Jasper seemed unusually quiet, interacting only briefly with her youngest sister before staring at the cartoon playing on the TV screen, her face devoid of any smiles.</p></div>
