        <h1>Chapter 2962</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, do you want me to stay here and create beautiful memories?" he asked, as if he could read her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Right." She nodded. "I hope that in the future, whenever we come here, it will be filled with happy memories. Let's go, I really want to try the ice cream inside!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke and took his hand, leading him towards the amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He followed her footsteps, taking one step at a time, moving forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she said, he never had any good memories in this amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the midst of others' laughter and joy at the amusement park, he couldn't seem to find happiness. Even when he came to the park for the first time with his classmates, he was left alone while they played together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time he comes here, he always feels a sense of loneliness, even if there are many people around him, this feeling of loneliness cannot be dispelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But this time, it's different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, he came here and finally didn't feel so lonely anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them entered the amusement park. Today, because it was Saturday, there were a lot of people, almost all parents bringing their children, and couples like Valda and Brian were rare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda got a recharge card and then dragged Brian to queue up and play some of the amusement facilities inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought you would feel embarrassed and not want to play with me." Valda said to Brian as they got off the roller coaster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The roller coaster here is a mini version compared to those in newer amusement parks, and the speed is not fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Valda remembers that she loved playing this when she was a child. Every time she came here, she would beg her father to let her play this more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a bit embarrassing, but I don't mind being embarrassed with you." Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's heart suddenly felt sweet, and she smiled and said, "Since you don't mind, let's go play something else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." He smiled and agreed, feeling like he had become younger at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them played other projects again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was feeling a bit hot, so the two of them went to the ice cream truck. Brian bought an ice cream for Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you not eat?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm past the age of eating this," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're talking as if you're ancient. Why don't you try a bite of mine?" Valda said, offering her ice cream to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression was somewhat unnatural, but when he met her hopeful gaze, he still opened his mouth and took a bite of the ice cream in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it delicious?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... it's okay, I guess," he said. The way he acted just now, if someone he knew saw him, that would be embarrassing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a voice rang out, "Hello Uncle Brian and Auntie Valda."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian and Valda turned their heads and saw Nelson standing next to them, along with Martin Weiss and Kyla, though they weren't sure when Nelson had arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a coincidence!" exclaimed Valda in surprise, as she didn't expect to run into Kyla and her family of three here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect you guys to come here to play," Kyla Corbyn looked at Valda and Brian, "Are you... reconciled?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Grace was not here, they didn't need to put on a show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda smiled slightly, "Yes, we are reconciled."</p></div>
