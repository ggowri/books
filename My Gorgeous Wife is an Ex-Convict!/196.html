        <h1>Chapter 195</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver immediately turned around and headed for the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason arrived at the hospital, they were still rescuing Master Reed. Jason stood outside the emergency room with an indescribable complicated feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how strong a man was, he would still struggle at such times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his eyes, his grandfather was strong, cruel, and cold. It seemed that he was only affectionate to his son who had lived a short life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone else seemed to be just pawns to him, including him, his grandson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed only regarded him as the future successor of the Reed family all this time, not as his grandson. In fact, there was no grandfather and grandson bond between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two hours passed before the door of the emergency room opened. "We've managed to save him. But Master Reed is old, and he had undergone a few operations earlier. Now it's just a matter of how long we can drag this out. At best, maybe a few years. At worst, maybe a few months," the doctor said to Jason after he came out from the emergency room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason naturally understood. No amount of money could control birth, age, illness, and death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed was sent to the intensive care unit for post-operative observation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Master Reed was taken out of the intensive care unit, and Jason finally met Master Reed face to face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard you were waiting outside the emergency room when I was being rescued?" Master Reed asked, but his voice was lighter than ever. It was laced with helplessness. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yup." Jason answered dryly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It must have been hard for you to stay outside the ward for an old man like me," Master Reed said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the old man dimly. "Grandfather, you got someone to send word to me about how you wanted to see me. Surely you're not just telling me these."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed got the nurse to help him drink two gulps water and asked everyone else in the ward to leave before looking at Jason. "I've checked that woman called Grace. A woman like her does not suit you. Just pick any high-born fair maiden in Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not Grandfather who decides whether someone suits me or not. Only I can do that," Jason answered directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The grandfather and grandson looked at each other, seemingly filling the air with tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Master Reed finally coughed twice and sighed. He was old and had cultivated his grandson into a qualified heir. However, he found that his grandson's growth was far beyond his imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that the beast had matured, he could not be the man to control it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You think she suits you?" Master Reed asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it matter?" Jason did not answer the question but asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed's face seemed to take on a ghastly expression. "Then tell me honestly, do you love her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His old, muddy eyes were fixed on his grandson as if he wanted to see all the changes in expression on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason met his eyes. He would have said no before. Since a very young age, he knew that love hurt, so he had never intended to fall in love with anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now... The words seemed to have a hard time coming out of his mouth naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if unconsciously, that woman was becoming more and more important to him. Even after she had rejected him once, he continued to interact with her as if... he was reluctant to part with her completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know," Jason replied. He knew that his grandfather never wanted him to give his love to a woman. To him, women were just tools to carry on the Reed family line.</p></div>
