        <h1>Chapter 2629</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened. "I know I did a terrible thing back then. I've been wanting to apologize to you all these years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said indifferently, "Okay, apologize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He froze as if he was a little stunned that she was this straightforward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you say you want to apologize? Now that I'm here, aren't you going to apologize?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman took a deep breath, and his thin lips parted gently as he spat out two words, "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I heard you. Can you let go now?" Valda Theller asked without any expression on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you forgive me?" Raymond Bowman's eyes contained a rare look of eagerness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've only acknowledged your apology. It doesn't mean I forgive you. I'm no saint. I'm not used to forgiving someone who used to hurt me, especially a man who hurt me to please another woman.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Don't call me Valda! Raymond Bowman, whatever happened between us is over to me. I don't hate you, but it doesn't mean that I&rsquo;ll forgive you for what you did. I only hope that we&rsquo;ll never meet again or that we'll treat each other like strangers when we meet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Strangers..." Raymond Bowman laughed bitterly. "If I said I could start over with you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she interrupted him before he could finish, "There's no starting over. I want nothing more to do with you. Raymond Bowman, I have no feelings for you anymore. And to tell you the truth, I only think it's some other bet you've made at my expense when you talk about starting over!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a pain in his eyes. "I won't hurt you again. I've been regretting what happened back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was still a calm expression on her face as if whatever he said did not matter to her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman could not help saying, "What about your so-called boyfriend? Do you think he's serious about dating you? That man looks rich and is good-looking. A man like him should have plenty of women around him. Maybe he's just fooling around with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said confidently, "He's serious about me! Whether a person is sincere or not has nothing to do with their looks and fortune but character. I trust my boyfriend's character, and I love him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, the last part was a lie. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's pupils shrank suddenly. His five fingers that clenched Valda Theller's arm slowly loosened. "You... love him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Yes, I love him very much. Raymond Bowman, I've heard your apology. I hope you'll leave me alone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she turned around and walked into her apartment block.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman stared blankly at the figure until it disappeared from his sight. He gently lowered his eyes and looked down at the hand that had grabbed her arm earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her warmth seemed to remain in his palm, but she was already so cold to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had once been warm to him, telling him, "Raymond Bowman, I like you very much. I think this is love. I think I&rsquo;ll always love you. Even if I've become an old woman, I will still love you this much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had destroyed her feelings for him!</p></div>
