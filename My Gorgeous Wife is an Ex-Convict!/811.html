        <h1>Chapter 810</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hear ye, hear ye. Here's to our new colleague, Grace!" Some colleagues raised their glasses and began toasting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, as the main character, was of course the focus of the toast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was not a very good drinker. After a few drinks, she was already a bit dizzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she could only repeatedly decline toasts from her colleagues and made an excuse to go to the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the bathroom, Grace leaned over the sink and washed her cheeks, which were steaming from alcohol, with water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she gazed at herself in the mirror with her almond-shaped eyes. Her hair on her forehead and cheeks were dripping with water. Her cheeks, delicate nose, and lips seemed more rosy than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As her eyes blinked gently, her eyelashes would fan like a small fan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, she had always felt that her eyelashes were quite long and beautiful. Sometimes when she put on light makeup, she did not even need mascara. However, after meeting Jason, she realized that one could forget about women when even men's eyelashes were beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jay&rsquo;s eyelashes are so beautiful. With those bright eyes, every quiver of his eyelashes seems to arouse people's hearts, making me unable to resist&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'God, why am I thinking of him again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head immediately and washed her face with cold water again to make herself sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'There's no more Jay in this world. There's only Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Grace walked out of the bathroom. Even after washing her face with cold water, her brain was still a little dizzy and she was probably going to be even drunker later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her phone rang. She took it out and saw that it was Lina calling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed the answer button and Lina's voice came from her phone. "Grace, where are you? Why aren't you at the rental house?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... came looking for me?" asked Grace. However, as soon as she opened her mouth, she got a little tongue-tied because of her drunken state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, what's happened to you? Why is your voice a little slurred?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I drank a little."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You drank? Where are you now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina got nervous instantly. After all, her best friend never really liked to drink!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm at Drunken Days," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Lina got even more nervous. After all, Drunken Days was no ordinary place. "I'm coming to pick you up. Wait for me. Stay there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Lina hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but chuckle. 'Does Lina think of me as a child? But... How nice it is to be cared for!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina is probably the only person who cares about me so much!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was about to wobble on, she suddenly stopped in her tracks. She saw a figure coming down the stairs not far ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's... Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help feeling a slight heat in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unlike before through the car window when she could only vaguely see a silhouette, his figure was so clear in her eyes now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so clear that even her eyes were hurting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was wearing a crisp suit. His bangs were still combed back, revealing his full forehead. His delicate features set off his angular face. There seemed to be an endless attraction in every act and gesture of his.</p></div>
