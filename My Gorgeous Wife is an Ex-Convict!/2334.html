        <h1>Chapter 2332</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper came to look for Kyla, and they went to buy Juliet gifts together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Chase Harper was still slightly worried about Kyla's condition. "Is it alright for you to go shopping for gifts with me like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just pregnant. It's not like I can't walk. Besides, aren't there many pregnant women who work these days? I'm just going to the mall to buy Juliet a gift," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... Let me know if you're tired and we'll find a place to rest," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," answered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two went to the mall and began to choose the gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper thought about buying clothes and shoes for his daughter, but in his eyes, everything looked the same. He did not know what his daughter liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla picked out a lemon-colored wool dress and a pair of white loafers to go with it. "By the way, what&rsquo;s Juliet's current height?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Chase Harper scratched his head in embarrassment. He did not know his daughter's height.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla knew from Chase Harper's reaction that he most likely had no idea about his child's height, so she tried to recall it from her memory. "The last time I saw Juliet, she was about 100cm tall. It's been a few months. I think I&rsquo;d better buy 110cm. Kids grow fast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll buy the 110cm one, then," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shop assistant nearby said, "Moms tend to know the child's height better. Dads can be confused about little things sometimes. You must love each other very much. Your wife's carrying another baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah, no... No..." Chase Harper instantly blushed and said as he waved his hands repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shop assistant seemed confused. Kyla smiled and said, "I'm not the child's mother. I'm friends with this gentleman, who wants to choose a gift for his daughter. So I'm here to help him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shop assistant was instantly embarrassed. "Sorry, I misunderstood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright," said Kyla. After all, she was pregnant and shopping with Chase Harper. They were also buying clothes for children. People would easily misunderstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She caressed her belly with her hand. She had thought of going shopping with Martin Weiss to buy their children clothes or something else, but she would probably never get to experience anything like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? What's on your mind?" Chase Harper walked up to Kyla after paying the bill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. By the way, I want to pick out a toy for Juliet," said Kyla. Then, she went to the children's toy section with Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla chose a small plush doll that looked like a cute little girl. The doll had a recording function for parents to record their voices. They could record different voice recordings on the hands, legs, and stomach. The maximum recording time was five minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've searched up the toy online before and it&rsquo;s pretty good. You can't be around Juliet all the time because of work, so you can record your voice to keep her company. For example, you can record a story so that she&rsquo;ll feel safe when she listens to it. She can fall asleep easier that way," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're so attentive. Thank you!" Chase Harper said gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like Juliet a lot too." Kyla smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pair had no idea they were being followed and their shopping trip was being filmed secretly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Martin Weiss was watching the video that was sent to his phone. It was a video of Kyla and Chase Harper picking out children's toys.</p></div>
