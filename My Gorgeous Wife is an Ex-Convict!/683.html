        <h1>Chapter 682</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed, I... I've done as you said. Please, let me live!" Dexter Rios said hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes were dark. The man in front of him was one of the main culprits in making Grace bear the crime. "As long as you never say what you shouldn't, you can keep your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dexter Rios was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he could, he would never even think about turning himself in. He was only forced by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even abroad, when someone like Jason wanted to go after someone, there was no getting away from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then, my family..." Dexter Rios said nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't touch your family since they don't know what you've done. However..." Jason's voice paused. Dexter Rios had just felt the slightest bit of relief when he was suddenly nervous again. "What you made Grace suffer and what you made her pay back then, you must now pay back twice as much." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dexter Rios was eager to defend himself, but Jason had already stood up as if he was too impatient to hear more from him. "Dexter Rios, I'll let you keep your life. You should thank Grace. She wants you to face the law. Otherwise, you wouldn't have the chance to talk to me right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fear flashed in Dexter Rios's eyes as he understood what the man was saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, remember, don't say anything you shouldn't. Otherwise, I can assure you, your worst nightmare will not be having to go to jail!" Jason finished and left the meeting room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only now that Dexter Rios realized his palms and his back were covered in a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that a man like Jason had thousands of cruel ways to torture someone, and there was no escape from it&mdash;No matter if he was in prison or abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All he could do now was do as he was told.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides... He had a feeling that not only he but also all those involved in that case would pay for it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only the first!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the seventh day after Grandma's death, and Grace went back to the town. Of course, she saw Stella Lindsay again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Stella Lindsay seemed to be avoiding her on purpose. She barely spoke to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was unbothered because she had never gotten along with Stella Lindsay, not to mention... Her mind was still full of doubts about the dream she had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, these days, she had no more dreams at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was time to leave town, Grace said to Jason, "Can we go somewhere nearby for a while? There's a place I'd like to see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." Jason agreed gladly. "Where do you want to go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was silent when the car stopped in front of a hill. He had read the investigation results and knew that a mountain was behind the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was called a hill, but it was covered with thickets and brambles. Some parts of the terrain were also incredibly steep. A few people died here every year because of accidents!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">More importantly&hellip; This was where Brian and Grace met!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little girl Brian was looking for was the one who saved him on this hill!</p></div>
