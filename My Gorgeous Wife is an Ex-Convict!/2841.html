        <h1>Chapter 2839</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated. Although she had jewelry on her, it belonged to Brian and was not at her disposal. Besides, she did not bring anything else with her today. She was flustered for a moment. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Noticing Valda Theller's silence, the emcee joked, "Is the beautiful lady having trouble deciding what to donate? Any small thing will do..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller remained silent. As her silence grew longer, many other voices appeared around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is she trying to get out of donating?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Some people are dressed to the nines but stingy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're so stingy, why attend a charity gala?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not far away, Phoebe Cross sneered at Valda Theller's awkwardness. Although this segment had always been a part of this gala, she had paid the lighting engineer to shine the light on Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to show Valda Theller how ridiculous it was to be an ugly duckling among swans!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla tried to help Valda Theller out when Valda Theller said suddenly, "I'd like to donate a portrait. I'm just looking for someone to be a model."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The emcee froze when he heard this answer. "Portrait? Are... Are you going to draw on the spot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, just give me a pen and a piece of paper. I'm a comic artist, so I&rsquo;d like to draw a portrait on the spot and donate it," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The surrounding voices increased instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What kind of valuable portrait can a cartoonist draw?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's not a popular artist either. How dare she donate a portrait she drew?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who on earth is she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller kept her back straight even though she heard the comments. She told herself that she could not chicken out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her drawing skills were the only thing she could show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you get me a pen and paper?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The emcee said, "Yeah... Of course... You can. I wonder what you're going to draw?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to draw&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's going to draw me." A voice interrupted Valda Theller, and she saw a tall figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked blankly at Brian. 'What is he saying? Does he want me to draw him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The emcee on the stage also froze and looked at Brian in shock. They knew Brian. "Mr. Hart, are you going to let this lady... draw you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's my girlfriend, so let me be her model," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone was instantly in an uproar, and the staff brought over the paper and pen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took the pen and paper and looked at Brian hesitantly. She was nervous.</p></div>
