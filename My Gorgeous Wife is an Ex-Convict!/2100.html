        <h1>Chapter 2098</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Watching the time tick by, her mother would probably get suspicious if she still did not go back. As she thought about it, Kyla hesitated whether to call her mother or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, she hit the corner of the desk nearby and a stack of papers fell off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla hurriedly crouched down to pick them up, but she froze after seeing photos of Chase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is Martin Weiss... investigating Chase?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla flipped through the papers that had fallen to the floor and found that they not only consisted of Chase but also Chase's ex-wife, Samantha Dean. There was even detailed information of the man Samantha Dean was living with... who was Chase's ex-best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla stared blankly at the information, feeling cold all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the door opened and Martin Weiss walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as Martin Weiss saw the papers Kyla was holding, he froze too. He had left the documents on the desk after going through them. He did not expect her to see them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at Martin Weiss and muttered, "Do you have anything to do with Samantha Dean asking Chase for money and giving Chase a hard time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes dimmed. As if mocking himself, the look in them seemed to say, &lsquo;Is that all I am to you?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Otherwise, why would you have these?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because of insecurity and fear. You once said Chase Harper is a good man, and that he matters to you and Nelson more than I do." He approached her step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So it's only natural that I would investigate a man who might be my rival in love, isn't it? Of course, I'd look into his ex-wife as well," said Martin Weiss as he got closer and closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She backed away until she reached the desk and was unable to retreat anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I had no idea that I&rsquo;m such a petty person in your eyes. Did you think I&rsquo;d let Chase Harper's ex-wife harass him and give him trouble?" Martin Weiss snorted coldly. "If I really wanted to do anything to Chase Harper, why would I go through so much trouble? I'd do it directly instead of just letting his ex-wife harass him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. 'Indeed, if Martin Weiss were to make a move himself, it would probably be hard for Chase to continue making a living in Emerald City.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, no matter what happens between you and me, don't do anything to Chase. He has nothing to do with us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, what she said seemed to provoke him. With a look of faint irritation on his face, he said, "Do you care about him that much? Are you that afraid I'm going to harm him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just don't want to involve any more innocent people," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Innocent?" He smiled bitterly. "You care so much about him that you keep asking me to leave him alone! Since he has a place in your heart, he isn't innocent!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, what on earth will it take for you to leave Chase alone? Will you leave him alone as long as I don't see or contact him anymore?" she asked as she met his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes dimmed even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does she know that the more she speaks like this, the more it means she wants to protect Chase Harper?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is that man really worth her attention?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I used to be the one she cared about!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss felt pain spreading in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, will you?" asked Kyla. It was as if she would not rest until she got an answer.</p></div>
