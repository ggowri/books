        <h1>Chapter 3635</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Jasmine put down her </span><span>fork and knife</span><span> and leaned towards Mason, trying to act cute. "Mason, just come with me once, I really want you to accompany me to the concert. This concert, it's on my birthday, and I'm planning to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish her act, her head was already pushed away by two fingers. "What time at night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Jasmine was still a bit dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, what time does the concert start at night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"8 o'clock at night!" Jasmine quickly responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, on that night, I'll take you there!" Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was pleasantly surprised, but amidst the surprise, she was also a little confused. Did she successfully persuade Mason through her persistent efforts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the problem is... this happened so quickly, it was only a few seconds, and Mason actually agreed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does this mean that Mason is too easily won over?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jasper went to see William, he mentioned this matter. William was somewhat surprised, "Mason accompanied Jasmine to the concert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's quite unexpected, right? I didn't expect Jasmine to make such a request, but Mason agreed," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, on the night Jasmine goes to the concert, what about her birthday party? Will it be held at noon?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, at noon, we'll all have a meal together. It's Jasmine's 11th birthday this year, and it's not a special day, so my parents don't plan on hosting a big event. They just want to invite some friends, as well as Jasmine's classmates and teachers, to our house for a meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William smiled. What she referred to as not planning a big event is actually already a big event for ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if the Reed family were to plan a big event, it would probably go viral!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about accompanying me to choose a birthday gift later? I haven't bought the gift for Jasmine yet," William said. It just so happens that he has a few days off from school, so he has time to pick out a gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure!" Jasper responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the afternoon, the two of them went to a shopping mall in the city center to pick out gifts. However, they wore masks and hats to avoid unnecessary trouble if they were recognized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an older sister, she naturally knew what her younger sister liked. So, she brought William to a counter selling bags.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William raised an eyebrow, "Are you hinting that I should buy you a gift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Jasper laughed, "It's a brand of bags. They have many that little girls like. Jasmine also likes this brand, but Mommy said she already has many bags and didn't buy her the new ones that just came out. So, why don't you buy it instead and consider it a birthday gift for her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she pulled William along to see what the latest items were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked at it. It was a rabbit bag, which indeed suited little girls' aesthetic. However, the price of 30,000 </span><span>dollars</span><span> was not something an ordinary person could afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William bought the bag and said to Jasper, "What about you? Is there anything you like? I'll buy it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper shook her head, "I don't need a bag right now. Think about what to give me for my birthday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two of them walked out of the mall, a ragged and dirty little boy approached Jasper.</span></p></div>
