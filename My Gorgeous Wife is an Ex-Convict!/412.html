        <h1>Chapter 411</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that she did not like him enough. He was afraid that her affection for him could be replaced anytime and she would leave him one day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly turned her body toward him so that they were facing each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even now it was dark all around the living room, but with the moonlight pouring in through the window, Grace could still see the outline of Jason's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that she could not see his expression right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could feel that he was looking at her too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She slowly raised her hand and pressed it against his cheek, solemnly saying, "All right, I'll like you more." If at first she was confused about their relationship and felt that there was no future in their relationship, now she begged to differ.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Regardless of their future, she wanted to accept this man, give him more of her affection, and soothe his unease&mdash;at least for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the end of her words, she tiptoed and took the initiative to kiss his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time she was sober and kissed him with all her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she had placed all her feelings for him in that kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body shuddered as if by surprise. Then, he opened his mouth and let her deepen the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only one who could make him do that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved her, and before he knew it, he loved her so much that he was afraid of it himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the end of the kiss, Grace was almost out of breath and would have fallen to the ground if not for Jason's arm supporting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said it yourself. You're going to like me... And then... fall in love with me," he whispered, lightly brushing her lips with his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt nothing but heat on her face and could only be thankful that the lights were not on right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, promise me that you'll forgive me if I ever do something wrong." There was a faint trill in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked surprised. "Do something wrong? What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. It just occurred to me that you might leave me if I did something wrong,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but laugh. She had not even thought about this, yet he was already thinking about it. "As long as you don't make any mistakes that are against my principles, of course I'll forgive you. When two people are in a relationship, are they just going to quarrel over minor things and leave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean by mistakes that are against your principles?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"For example, infidelity. I'll leave if you've fallen in love with someone else," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she was scarred from previous relationships, she still hoped for an unadulterated relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she yearned for were loyalty and a life-long commitment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It could be ordinary and not so dazzling. It just had to last forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her past with Sean taught her that the purer the relationship, the rarer it was.</p></div>
