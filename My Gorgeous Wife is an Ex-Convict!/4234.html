        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Tina and Chandler went to the hospital's newborn ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby was still in the incubator, but compared to what Tina had seen before, it was much better, and it seemed to have grown a bit, no longer as fragile as before as if it could disappear at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you thought about the baby's name?" Tina and Chandler entered the room after putting on sterile gowns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her hand touched her daughter's tiny hand, an indescribable feeling surged up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her daughter, the little life she had fought so hard to protect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've thought of some names, I've written them down, you can take a look later when we leave," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse took the baby out of the incubator and let Tina try holding the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler seemed worried that Tina still had injuries and might not have the strength to hold the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina said, "It's okay, I still have some strength left, I want to hold her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse carefully placed the baby in Tina's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina held the baby, watching her daughter's little hands wave slowly, a smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, do you want to hold her?" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler seemed hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt a bit disappointed, "If you don't want to, then forget it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" he quickly denied, "I'm just not sure how to face her, I do want to hold her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the little baby was handed over to Chandler's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully looked at the tiny baby in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Different from his previous impression, her skin was not as wrinkled as before, gradually becoming fuller, and faintly showing some resemblance to Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his and Tina's daughter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, it's Dad's fault for not protecting you and not finding you and your mom earlier," Chandler whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his handsome face, there was an indescribable sense of guilt and self-reproach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When visiting time was over, Tina and Chandler left the neonatal ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little one would still have to stay here for some time until she reached the required weight before she could be discharged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina turned to Chandler and said, "Let's go on a date next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A date?" Chandler was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just consider it as starting to fall in love again. Otherwise, how can I fall in love with you all over again?" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of waiting for the memories to suddenly come back, it would be more practical to try and see if she could fall in love with him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her tenderly and said, "Alright, let's go on a date then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did we do when we went on dates before?" she asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We would go shopping, eat whatever you wanted, or do whatever you wanted, like going to see a movie, an art exhibition, or a concert if there was something you wanted to see," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina frowned. "Why is it always what I want? What about you? When we go on dates, is there nothing that we do that you want to do too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a bit boring, I don't have any particular hobbies," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, being with her and seeing her happy was already a source of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you should think about what you like too," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words made Chandler pause for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Tina had said something like this to him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, you can't always just go along with what I like. I feel like you're indifferent to everything. I know you care about me, and even though this special care makes me happy, don't you think your life would be more interesting if you didn't always do that?"</span></p></div>
