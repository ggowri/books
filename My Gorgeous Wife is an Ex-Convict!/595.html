        <h1>Chapter 594</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz felt speechless right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a colleague who often disagreed with Andrea Schwartz sneered and said, "Hey, someone who wanted to embarrass an ex-colleague ends up getting embarrassed herself. Maybe she can't be a lawyer anymore by tomorrow, just like the ex-colleague. This is a good example for the rookies!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz's face turned pale suddenly. Long gone was her usual silver tongue. Her eyes were full of panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If that happened, she would be nothing but a joke to lawyers from now on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had she known this would happen, she would never have plotted it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace reached the ground floor of the building, but before she could reach her electric bike, Brian ran up and grabbed her arm. "Why would you rather run around the streets in a tea-stained shirt like this than accept my kindness? Do you hate me? Is that why you don't even want to touch my stuff?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace tried to pull her arm out of his hand, but it was to no avail. He grabbed her fingers even tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just thought it would be a hassle to return the suit jacket. Since the weather is hot now, the shirt will be dry in a minute," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So it doesn't matter if I&rsquo;m looking at you like this?" he asked as his eyes darted across her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stiffened. "If you&rsquo;re a man of integrity, you wouldn't look." Then, she kept telling herself, 'Think of it as a bathing suit, a bathing suit!' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ve never thought of myself as a man of integrity!" Brian said as he forcibly wrapped his suit jacket around her chest. "You're increasing the chances of other people committing crimes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." She blushed immensely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Keep the suit jacket on. You don't need to return it to me. It's up to you to throw it away or give it away." He just did not want her exposed like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want it even if it was only faintly visible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strangely enough, he would not have cared about any other woman. However, when he saw her discomfited with tea on her chest, he felt a pang in his heart. He could not help wanting to protect her and take her under his wings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. Thank you, Mr. Hart," Grace said insistently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Such an unfamiliar thanks again.' Brian pressed his thin lips together tightly. "Must you refuse me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think it&rsquo;ll cause unnecessary misunderstandings if I wear Mr. Hart's suit jacket," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes darkened. "Who are you afraid of being misunderstood by? Your family, or... Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said nothing, but the refusal in her eyes was unmistakable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian laughed at himself. He was usually the one who refused others, but this woman in front of him had refused him again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sighing, he offered her options. "Either you go back in my suit jacket, or you buy something to change into. In short, I don't want to see you running around like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to counter when Brian immediately said, "If you accept neither of these two options, then we can just waste our time here and see who has better patience."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a bit speechless. If she did end up wasting her time here with the crown prince, she would be making headlines!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Out of the corner of her eye, she caught sight of a clothing shop not far away and immediately said, "I'll buy something to wear, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, where are you going to buy it?" he asked calmly.</p></div>
