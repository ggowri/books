        <h1>Chapter 1194</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she said yes, he would do his best to give her the ending she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to his disappointment... what she said was, "Brian, you saved my life, and as long as what you want me to do isn't against my conscience, I'll do it, but I can't say yes to this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sneered suddenly. "So this is against your conscience? Grace, is this man that important to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. It was not so much that Chase Harper was important, but this probably only happened to him because of her. Besides, Chase Harper reminded her of herself when she was unable to convince others back then. Saving Chase Harper was like saving herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her silence only made Brian's face darken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella walked quickly to Brian's side, gently held his arm, and said, "Brian, don't be mad. Grace was deceived into believing that Chase Harper is innocent because she cares too much about him. But in fact, Chase Harper is full of lies. I was able to escape the car because I was lucky that someone passed by and distracted him. Otherwise... I... I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella began to weep again as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a lump in her throat as she watched Stella put on a show. "Do you believe her?" she asked, looking at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why shouldn't I? If you believe Chase Harper only because he's your former colleague, then I believe Stella because she saved my life when I was a child. Don't you think this reason is much better than yours?" Brian said, glancing at Stella and promising, "Alright, Stella. Stop crying. I'll help you get justice with this lawsuit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Brian. Thank you for believing in me!" Stella sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt like she was slapped in the face when she saw this. The secret she was hiding and the identity she had given up only to be taken over by Stella had now become the most powerful sword against her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her almond-shaped eyes and stared at Brian. She took a deep breath and said with some determination, "Would you believe me if I tell you that I was the one who saved your life when you were a child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's pupils narrowed, and he looked at Grace in shock. "What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said... I was the one who saved your life when you were a child!" Grace repeated, then asked, "If it had been me and not Stella who you met in the forest, would you still believe what she&rsquo;s saying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's expression changed. Grace suddenly telling the truth was out of her expectations, but... so what if she said it now? Did Grace think Brian would believe her if she said so?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella quickly showed a look of disbelief and said, "Grace, how can you say that? Even if you're eager to save Chase Harper, you can't slander me like that! I'm your cousin! Even though we've been quarreling, we're still relatives. How can you make up such a lie for a so-called colleague?!"</p></div>
