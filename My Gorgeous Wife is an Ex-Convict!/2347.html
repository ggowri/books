        <h1>Chapter 2345</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla tried her best to speak calmly, "I see. Okay, I'll never show up in front of you again from now on. I won't disturb your peace again either. Let's never... speak to each other again. I'll keep my word this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was frigid as he stared at her darkly. The hands dangling at his sides clenched into fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only he knew how stiff his body became when he heard her say that. Even his blood seemed to have frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Never... speak to each other again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This woman never changes. She&rsquo;ll only tell me the most hurtful things!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Very well! You'd better remember what you said today!" Martin Weiss said and left the hotel room without looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rage that filled his chest almost overwhelmed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even he could not explain why he was so angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had disturbed his peace and was now leaving so readily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss returned to Weiss Residence, Mrs. Weiss was at home. When she saw her son, she immediately came up to him and said, "Martin, I want to talk to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Mom, if you want to talk about Kyla, don't bother! She's leaving for Emerald City tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss froze. "Is she returning to Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think? Isn't it natural for her to leave and return to Emerald City since there's no way I'll agree to her request?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Return to Emerald City... Return to Emerald City..." Mrs. Weiss muttered before finally heaving a long sigh. "It's great that she's returning to Emerald City. That way, she won't have any more influence on you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said nothing and walked toward the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss shouted, "Stop thinking about Kyla. You can have any woman you want. I don't care whether you find an heiress or a girl without any family background. I just hope you'll stop obsessing over Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stopped walking. "Mom, I don't want to talk about this now. I'll find someone when I want someone. If I don't want someone, then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not finish the rest of his speech and just went up the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss's heart sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If he doesn't want someone, is he... going to spend the rest of his life alone?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Karma... It's really karma..." Mrs. Weiss sat down on the couch as she mumbled in a choked voice...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since her son said such a thing, it meant... he never got over her, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's high-speed train was scheduled to depart at three p.m., so she checked out of her hotel room at noon and met up with Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I help you with your suitcase? You're pregnant, so be careful. You gotta pay attention when you enter the train station too." Chase Harper reminded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Kyla. She did not refuse his offer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had lunch at a nearby cafe, then took a taxi to the train station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car stopped at the train station's entrance, and the two got off. Chase Harper took the suitcase while Kyla walked beside him. The two of them looked like a married couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A black car was parked nearby, and the person in it was staring silently at Kyla and Chase Harper, who were getting out of a taxi.</p></div>
