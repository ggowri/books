        <h1>Chapter 344</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then said to Jason, "Wait here while I go and get the medicine." With that, she hurried out of the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason laid on the sofa. Wait here... That was also what she had said previously when she went out to buy medicine for him late at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All right. He would wait. He would wait for her to come back...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurried to the residence's iron gate. There was a street lamp beside the iron gate, which happened to shine on the deliveryman's bewildered face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The delivery man did not expect to deliver medicine to the entrance of such a big mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You ordered this? Miss Cummins?" the man asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's me," Grace replied as she took the medicine from the man. She thanked him before she turned and ran in the direction of the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The deliveryman scratched his head. He glanced at the huge mansion that seemed endless, still a little bewildered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Reed Residence's security room, several security guards gawked at the surveillance screen as Grace ran out of the mourning hall to fetch medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh my God. She got out in one piece?" someone exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did she order... food?" After all, there was no way to see clearly from the surveillance screen. All they could see was Grace taking a package from the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed did not kick her out, and... is going to eat with her?" Someone was amazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young Master Reed had allowed Grace to move into Reed Residence, so they knew the woman was special to Young Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, not everyone could enter the mourning hall. Other than the old servant who had been working for the Reed family for decades, only Young Master Reed and Old Master Reed could go in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, a woman had set foot in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they first watched the woman enter the mourning hall from the surveillance, they joked that she would probably be kicked out soon and that Young Master Reed might kick her out of Reed Residence tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who knew that the woman had entered and remained there for some time. When she got out, it was to collect her delivery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What a shock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little did Grace know that her status among the Reed Residence security guards had soared. Her only thought was to get back to the mourning hall as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in the mourning hall, she looked at Jason who was huddled on the sofa. His eyes were closed and there was no color in his pale face, which contrasted sharply with the deep red stain on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips... As she walked closer, she saw a trace of blood on his lips. He probably bit his lips to endure the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A thin layer of sweat appeared on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Jay... Jason, the medicine is here. Now take it." As she spoke, she filled a cup of warm water, then unpacked the medicine and took it out according to the directions.</p></div>
