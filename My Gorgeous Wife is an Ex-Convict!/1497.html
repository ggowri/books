        <h1>Chapter 1495</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace now understood why one of her hands was tied to the handbrake and the other to the steering wheel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One to live and one to die. No matter what she chose, there was no ideal outcome!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No one knew how many bombs were buried in front of her car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was no time even if Jason wanted to investigate it carefully. Moreover, if someone accidentally triggered the bomb and caused an explosion, that would be the worst-case scenario!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is there really no chance of survival?' Grace kept racking her brain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was still on the video call with Lily through the phone in front of her. She heard what was being said and smiled as she spoke, &ldquo;Well, isn't that interesting? Grace, what do you think Jason will do? He'll just leave you to die and have you become a sacrifice!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was in no mood to pay attention to Lily. All her attention was on Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At the moment, Jason was also looking at Grace. There seemed to be some determination in his black eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, Grace seemed to realize something and shouted, "Jay, no! There must be another way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason had already taken out his phone and turned on the recording function. "I, Jason, will leave all the fortune in my name to my wife, Grace, after my death! This message is an expression of my true wishes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, he threw his phone to Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence caught the phone and froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is Master Reed... exchanging his life for Grace's? He even... recorded his last words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But... if Master Reed dies, then...' Terrence dared not continue thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang also seemed a little startled. He looked at Jason, asking, "Young Master, are you really going to use your life to save that woman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "Didn't Grandpa want to bet with me? Now, he'll know if he's lost or won."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang said after a moment of silence, "There's a recording from Old Master on the device. You can hear it by pressing the green button."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason did not speak but walked toward the device that would trigger the explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence shouted at Secretary Wang, "What are you thinking? Master Reed is Old Master's grandson! How could Old Master have wanted Master Reed dead? Is there another solution? Hurry up and speak!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang said with a half-smile, "There's no other way. So what if Jason is his grandson? Old Master doesn't care about all these."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence instantly became speechless. Indeed, Old Master was not someone who attached great importance to family. There was very little family affection between Master Reed and Old Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;Did the old master want to bet that Master Reed's affection for Grace isn't that deep?'</p></div>
