        <h1>Chapter 201</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Nothing happened. Since she did some things she shouldn&rsquo;t have, naturally, she should bear the consequences,&rdquo; Brian said carelessly as if he did not think it was a big deal at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Grace heard it, her heart jumped. Saying it this way&hellip; Had Emily Theller been silenced? She might even have been forced out of show business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From then on, she would no longer have luxuries to adorn herself and would have to live a plain life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On this planet, how many would willingly choose plainness? Especially someone who had experienced luxury before. She was afraid Emily Theller would not be able to withstand that kind of commoner&rsquo;s plainness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What, are you sympathizing her?&rdquo; Brian looked at the woman before his eyes and said, &ldquo;That day, Emily Theller was not courteous to you at all, though.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sympathizing. I think she wouldn&rsquo;t want my sympathy either,&rdquo; Grace said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to treat me to a meal as an apology either. I need to catch the bus back to Emerald City.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I still want to treat you to a meal.&rdquo; Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said indifferently, &ldquo;Can it be that you want to use force to treat me to a meal?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to use force, but using it occasionally isn&rsquo;t bad either.&rdquo; Brian pulled Grace&rsquo;s hand as he spoke, taking big steps toward the car park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Brian, what are you planning to do?&rdquo; Lig Grace yelled in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Just want to have a meal with you,&rdquo; he said casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it really just to have a meal? If a man like him really wanted to find a woman to have a meal with, he would have plenty of women who would willingly accompany him. There was absolutely no need for him to force her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was in doubt, the two of them had already arrived in front of Brian&rsquo;s car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian opened the passenger seat door, but Grace said, &ldquo;Mr. Hart, I really don&rsquo;t have time to accompany you for a meal. If I miss this the last bus, I won&rsquo;t be able to return to Emerald City tonight.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His ink-black phoenix eyes stayed fixed on the person in front of him. He said, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re really unwilling to have this meal with me, I can guarantee that you definitely won&rsquo;t be able to catch any buses tonight.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace choked. She knew Brian&rsquo;s capabilities. If he really wanted to do this, it would not be hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why must I have this meal with you?&rdquo; she asked, puzzled. If this was just an apology for the last meal, it was too extreme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Because I have some things to ask you,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him dubiously. After considering it for a moment, she got into the passenger seat. If she really were to take this up with him at this time, it would not have much meaning for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she had gone through three years of prison life. She knew a lot more now than back then. She knew that someone like him could easily change another&rsquo;s destiny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how he easily made Emily Theller vanish in show business. Emily Theller had even been a star who was quite famous with a whole bunch of fans, but she got shunned by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not even compare to Emily Theller. She was only a sanitation service worker now. It was a lot easier to destroy her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For just an instant, Jason&rsquo;s appearance flashed through Grace&rsquo;s mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If&hellip; that day really came, would Jason be willing to lend her a helping hand?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Heavens! What was she thinking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace inwardly mocked herself for the thought that occurred to her just now.</p></div>
