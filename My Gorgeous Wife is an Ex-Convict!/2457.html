        <h1>Chapter 2455</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sniffled. "Kyla&rsquo;s hospital report doesn&rsquo;t look too good. Due to Kyla's pregnancy, her liver isn't working very well. She might need a liver transplant after she gives birth, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "It's the issue of finding a donor, isn&rsquo;t it? Martin Weiss won't do it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. "But it's normal. His affection for Kyla isn't what it used to be. Besides, he has donated his liver before. It's too dangerous for him to donate it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could say that he would be gambling on his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many people in this world could risk their lives for another person?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll go back to Emerald City and find a solution. Maybe things won&rsquo;t have to be that bad," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if it comes to that and Kyla doesn't have the right liver..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said sternly, "She must have thought of that possibility. Everyone is responsible for their own decisions. Since Kyla made up her mind to give birth to the baby, she would probably have thought of the worst."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze, then heard Jason continue, "Since things have come to this, it means that she thinks the price is worth it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath. 'Worth it? Is it really worth it to Kyla?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But then again, didn't I think it was worth it when I was pregnant with the triplets? I was willing to bet my life on the survival of the triplets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe that's what motherhood is like. You'll be reluctant to let go of the little life in your belly no matter what.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was lucky to have survived with our three children," muttered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you were lucky. We were lucky." Jason held Grace and said, "I'll protect you from now on. I'll protect you with my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled slightly. Suddenly, her expression changed slightly as she covered her mouth with her hand and her shoulders trembled. It looked like she was about to vomit. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "What's the matter? Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm a little nauseous. Maybe it's because I ate too much glutinous rice cake this morning and am having indigestion," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sighed helplessly at that. "I told you to eat less, didn't I? You'll get easily bloated if you eat too much of that stuff."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's probably because I haven't eaten it for a long time, so I found it so delicious that I couldn&rsquo;t stop eating," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn&rsquo;t you used to dislike such sickly sweet food?" Jason asked.</p></div>
