        <h1>Chapter 2526</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell made up her mind to transfer her funds and sell some of her shares during her stay in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was afraid to sell them all for fear of arousing George Gregory's suspicions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, even if she only sold a portion, it would be enough to ensure a lavish life for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day of the transfusion, Simon lay weakly in the hospital bed and said to Louise Mitchell, "Mommy, why haven't you come to see me? I've missed you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell had nothing but disgust for the son who called her &lsquo;Mommy&rsquo;. He was becoming increasingly like Amber Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she still pretended to look like she missed him. "I've come to see you, haven't I? Simon, don't worry. I&rsquo;ll save you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory glanced coldly at Louise Mitchell, who was putting on an act. Then, he turned to look tenderly at his son, saying, "Alright, be good and get some sleep. You&rsquo;ll slowly get better after you wake up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon nodded obediently and closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory turned to the medical staff nearby and said, "Let's get started."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell lay in another hospital bed and watched as a nurse stuck a needle into her arm. Warm blood began to pour into Simon's body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the only thing that could save Simon was his biological mother's blood, Simon would surely die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would never tell George Gregory that Simon's biological mother was Amber Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would go abroad to enjoy life, while George Gregory would face the pain of losing his son. How wonderful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell could not help smiling at the thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since George Gregory wronged her, he could not blame her for all this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The transfusion was finally completed after a week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was very weak at the moment. After all, she had been pumping more blood out of her body this week than a regular person could handle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can I leave the hospital and go home now?" Louise Mitchell asked George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're going back? You can stay in the hospital and rest for a few more days." George Gregory was slightly surprised by Louise Mitchell's eagerness to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I don't want to be in the hospital too long," said Louise Mitchell. Besides, the longer she stayed, the more likely she would get into trouble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said nothing more. He only said, "You don't need to go back to the Gregory family&rsquo;s house. I've packed all your things and sent them back to the Mitchell family's residence. You'll see them when you return to the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell froze and immediately understood that George Gregory had decided to separate from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, are you kicking me away after using me?" Louise Mitchell asked bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I helped you get acquitted, and you gave Simon your blood. Our deal is done. That's all there is," George Gregory said indifferently as he looked at Louise Mitchell's cold eyes without any emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell smiled sarcastically. "You're indeed cold-blooded. You're right. That's all there is between us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man had never had the slightest affection for her. It was time she gave up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After returning to the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house, Louise Mitchell found all her belongings in Gregory Residence already in the Mitchell family's living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her pretty face began to contort when she saw them. She had tried every means to join the Gregory family. She even committed a crime. However, she was now kicked out by the Gregory family in such a way!</p></div>
