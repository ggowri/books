        <h1>Chapter 2020</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Mommy did a lot of bad things. If Jasper finds out...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could not help trembling at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After an unknown amount of time, he heard voices outside the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Are Jasper and the rest back?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Happy birthday, Jasper!" He silently wished her in his heart. He heard that her birthday party was lavish, and many big shots attended it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wore a pink chiffon dress and a small tiara on her head when she went out today. She looked so beautiful, just like a little princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She must have looked even prettier at the party, surrounded by various lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In fact... he wanted to give her the present he had prepared for her at her birthday party, even if it was worthless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sometime later, his room door was suddenly pushed open. He saw a figure dressed in pink come in carrying a slice of cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Great, you're still up! If you had fallen asleep, this cake wouldn&rsquo;t be a birthday cake anymore tomorrow!" said Jasper as she held the cake in front of William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Here, this is my birthday cake. I saved a big slice for you. It's delicious. Try it," Jasper said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William stared blankly at the cake in front of him. After a long time, he finally reached out his hand, took the cake from her, and began to eat it one bite at a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The cake was creamy and not overly sweet. It was delicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper was cupping her chin and smiling as she watched William eat the cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I've talked to Mommy. Mommy says we'll have a simpler party and not invite so many people next year. You must join my birthday party next year!" said Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William paused as he ate the cake. &lsquo;Can... Can I really join her birthday party next year? Or will I not be able to attend any of her birthday parties in the future just like this time?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It will be your birthday in January, William. I'm going to celebrate your birthday with you!" Jasper continued saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, William suddenly felt as though the cake had become heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'My birthday... I don't deserve to have my birthday celebrated in the Reed family, right? A child like me isn't fit to celebrate my birthday in the Reed family&rsquo;s house.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I don't like celebrating my birthday." He fumbled for an excuse. "I... I don't like it when everyone knows my birthday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I see." Jasper blinked her dark almond-shaped eyes as they seemed to be full of confusion. "Then... how about I celebrate your birthday in secret? Then no one else will know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She spoke a little smugly as if they had another little secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William bit his lip a little. Moments later, he nodded his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After finishing the cake in his hand, William seemed to summon up his courage. "I... I got you a birthday present, but it isn't worth much. If you don't like it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll love whatever you give me." Her almond-shaped eyes were curved as she held her hands open in front of him, waiting for him to place the present in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, William took Jasper Reed's hand and walked out of the room, all the way to the Reed family's piano room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was where he and Jasper practiced piano at home.</p></div>
