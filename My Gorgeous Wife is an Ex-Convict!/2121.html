        <h1>Chapter 2119</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'So let's keep things as they are. I&rsquo;ll divorce him after the baby is one year old!' Kyla looked down at her flat belly and said to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla thought that there would be no more contact between her and Martin Weiss after obtaining the birth permission certificate and they would continue living their separate lives as before. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she did not expect was that Martin Weiss showed up at the store&rsquo;s entrance on the day of her pregnancy check-up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you..." She stared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Don't you have a pregnancy check-up today? I'll accompany you to future check-ups."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla felt a tingle in her scalp. If he was going to accompany her to her pregnancy check-ups, then he would probably show up at her place several times a month. Perhaps... even more often than that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks. I can go to the pregnancy check-ups myself. I don't need anyone to accompany me," she said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "I'm not just accompanying you but also our baby. I didn't accompany you when you were pregnant with Nelson, so you and Nelson suffered a lot. I don't want the same thing to happen to this baby. At least let me take my responsibility as a father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss went on and said, "Besides, you're pregnant. In case anything happens, I can help you run errands if I accompany you during the check-ups. Do you wanna run up and down the stairs in the hospital when you have a big belly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn, who was looking after the store, also said, "Kyla, why don't you... let him accompany you to the check-up? I'll feel more relieved that way. It's safer to have someone with you just in case something happens."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla bit her lip slightly and agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss drove Kyla to the community hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Pregnancy check-ups up before a pregnant woman was 24 weeks along were performed at community hospitals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, a grave look came over the face of the community hospital doctor after he got a detailed understanding of Kyla's past medical history.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You&rsquo;ve undergone liver transplantation and recently got past five years of the recovery period. The general pregnancy check-up here might not be suitable for you. You'd better go to a tertiary women's hospital for further examination," the community hospital doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's expression froze when she heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It had been five years... since the liver transplant. Even though her condition was under control, would it still impact the baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, got it. Thank you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's better to go to Municipal Women's Hospital. They have the most authoritative and experienced gynecological and obstetrical doctors," the community hospital doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emerald City&rsquo;s Municipal Women's Hospital was the most famous public women's hospital in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla responded in acknowledgment and walked out of the maternity consultation room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was waiting outside. When he saw Kyla coming out, he could not help asking, "So soon?" She had come out only after going in for a few minutes. The examination usually took more than ten minutes.</p></div>
