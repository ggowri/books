        <h1>Chapter 4129</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Typically, people with sudden illnesses like asthma would carry their medication with them. Since Kit was dressed in casual clothes instead of his stage costume, if he had any medicine, it should be on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although the elevator was now in complete darkness due to the power outage, fortunately, she had her phone with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though there was no signal and she couldn't make calls, the flashlight on her phone was enough to provide some light in the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina held her phone in one hand and felt around Kit's body with the other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What... What are you doing?" a trembling hand was placed on Tina's hand, and Kit's strained voice came through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm looking for medicine. Do you have any with you?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No... I don't have any... I don't need to take any medicine," he said intermittently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina was speechless. His current condition definitely didn't seem like he didn't need medicine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Due to his rapid breathing, his chest was visibly rising and falling. Through the light of her phone, she saw large beads of sweat forming on his forehead, continuously trickling down his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even the hand resting on the back of her hand was trembling violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No, it wasn't just his hand trembling, it seemed like his whole body was shaking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if he was scared of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you...do you really not need to take any medicine? What's going on with you?" Tina asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's just...," Kit gasped for breath, his voice dry, "it's just...claustrophobia, nothing serious, no one will die..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Claustrophobia?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had only seen this symptom in movies and TV shows before. She never expected it to appear right in front of her, and that Kit would be the one suffering from it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in all the information she found online about Kit, there was never any mention of him having claustrophobia!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then...why did you still get on the elevator?" Don't people with claustrophobia avoid enclosed spaces?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"For a short time, as long as I'm not alone, it's fine." Because she was there in the elevator, he chose to get on. But he didn't expect the elevator to suddenly break down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The longer he stayed in the elevator, the waves of fear that used to terrify him would keep rising, almost engulfing him like waves in the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So, what can be done to relieve your symptoms?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But at that moment, it was as if Kit couldn't hear her voice. His eyes were tightly closed, his teeth biting his lower lip, and his whole body curling up like a shrimp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His trembling body, and the sweat that kept dripping, seemed to be telling of his fear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing this, Tina took a deep breath, thought for a moment, and then leaned against Kit, reaching out to embrace him, speaking in the gentlest tone possible, "Don't be afraid, you're not alone now, I'm here with you, so there's nothing to be afraid of..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She kept saying comforting words while slowly and rhythmically stroking Kit's back with one hand, as if she was petting a dog.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She remembered from watching TV shows before that when someone with claustrophobia had an attack, it was important to try to comfort them as much as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To make them feel at ease!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To provide some psychological guidance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, she wasn't a psychology student, so she couldn't offer professional psychological guidance.</p></div>
