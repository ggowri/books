        <h1>Chapter 1583</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson had come to the banquet today, and the person standing next to him was Katherine Jackson. Katherine Jackson was wearing the same gown she wanted to try on before this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson also saw Grace, and his expression could not help changing slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson looked at Hadwin Stephenson and could not help smiling. "You're old friends with Mrs. Reed of the Reed family, aren&rsquo;t you? Why don't you go and say hello?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, Katherine Jackson took Hadwin Stephenson's arm and led him to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson walked up to Grace passively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hello, Mrs. Reed. I'm Katherine Jackson," Katherine Jackson greeted with a smile on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hello," said Grace as she gave her a complicated look. After all, maybe Hadwin Stephenson and Lina would not have broken up if not for this woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... there might have been other women even if Katherine Jackson had not appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, what Hadwin Stephenson wanted more than romance was absolute control over the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Speaking of which, I have some relations with Hadwin and Mrs. Reed too. Hadwin's ex-girlfriend seems to be your best friend, Mrs. Reed. I heard she's not married yet. Aren't you going to introduce your friend to some elites, Mrs. Reed?" Katherine Jackson said with a smile, but she was being blunt with her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Katherine Jackson and saw that Hadwin Stephenson seemed to have turned pale under the lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You don't have to worry about that, Miss Jackson. Lina's my friend. I'll help her whenever she needs me. And I naturally won't let anyone who wants to harm her off!" Grace said solemnly as she wiped the smile off her face, making her point to Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If Katherine Jackson wanted to harm Lina, she would definitely protect Lina and... not let Katherine Jackson off!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson smiled. "With you protecting her, Lina will surely be alright. By the way, Hadwin and I will be going back in a few days to make preparations for our wedding. You're welcome to the wedding dinner, Mrs. Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Wedding dinner?' Grace's red lips were pulled into a smile, and she looked at Hadwin Stephenson somewhat sarcastically. Since the man had decided to marry Katherine Jackson, why did he bother appearing in front of Lina and setting off waves in her heart when she was starting to move on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, another voice rang out. It was a woman in a red gown. She had on gorgeous makeup and wore expensive jewelry. She looked extremely flamboyant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who do you want to protect as soon as you come back, Mrs. Reed? Speaking of which, Mrs. Reed, you came back from the dead after five years. You left Emerald City for five years and returned all of a sudden. Why don't you tell us what you've been through the last five years?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace recognized the woman as Simona Menzie, the daughter of the president of a real estate company that Reed group worked with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Real estate had been booming in recent years, so the Menzie family became nouveau riche. Their assets had increased tenfold. From a second-rate real estate company, it had become one of the top real estate companies in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie was also one of the women who had their eyes on Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had done her homework before coming to the banquet. She got some detailed information from Terrence and knew who was attending, as well as which women had shown an interest in Jay in the last five years!</p></div>
