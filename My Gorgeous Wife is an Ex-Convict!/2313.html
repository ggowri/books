        <h1>Chapter 2311</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A trip...' Kyla smiled bitterly. She did not have the mood and time for a trip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn, I'm going to hang up now if there's nothing else..." said Mallory Malcom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" Kyla uttered a low cry. She hesitated a moment before saying, "Martin Weiss... Does he hate me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." Mallory Malcom thought it over and replied, "Chairman Weiss probably doesn't hate you, but... he doesn't treat you like he used to. Perhaps Chairman Weiss has put the relationship behind him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla trembled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Has he... put it behind him? I used to think that he loved me too much, while I loved him too little.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the one who loved more had moved on, while the one who loved less had not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart throbbed in fits of pain. Even though Mallory Malcom had ended the call, Kyla still held her phone in her hand as she fell into a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only came to her senses after a long time. If Martin Weiss would not see her, she could only go to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Putting her phone away, she grabbed her wallet and hotel key card before walking out of her hotel room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the hotel&rsquo;s entrance, Kyla hauled a taxi and gave the address of Weiss Group. After all, it was second to none in L City. The address could be found online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the taxi arrived at the company building&rsquo;s entrance, Kyla got out and looked at the towering building as she recalled a memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was dating Martin Weiss at the time, and Weiss Group had not reached its current scale. The company building was not in the best location in tMason Swansonty center but was in an office building in the remote part of tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Weiss family owned the building, but it was a little old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He once pointed to the office building and said to her, "I&rsquo;ll build Weiss Group in tMason Swansonty center one day. I&rsquo;ll make the Weiss family the number one family in tMason Swansonty. When that day comes, I&rsquo;ll marry you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, his wish had come true. The Weiss family&rsquo;s building was in the heart of tMason Swansonty, but he only married her for their children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their marriage was not a genuine marriage, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took a deep breath and walked to the reception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"May I speak to Chairman Martin Weiss? I want to see him," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have an appointment?" the receptionist asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, but I'm..." She hesitated and did not say the words &lsquo;his wife&rsquo;. After all, they would divorce one day, and her status as his wife was only temporary. "I&rsquo;m someone who has known him for many years and I want to see him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry. I can't help you without an appointment. After all, if everyone who knows Chairman Weiss needs to see him, Chairman Weiss would be too busy just meeting people," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together. "May I make an appointment now, then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't take appointments here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could only take out her phone and call Mallory Malcom again. "Mallory, are you in the company building? I'm at the reception area."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom was surprised. Then, he said, "Ah, well... Just wait a moment. I'll be right with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Mallory Malcom came in a hurry, Kyla was still waiting in the reception area. Upon seeing Kyla, Mallory Malcom immediately said, "Uh... W-What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to see Martin Weiss," Kyla said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I told you on the phone... This..."</p></div>
