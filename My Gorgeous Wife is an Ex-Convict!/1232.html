        <h1>Chapter 1231</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will it endanger the mother's life?" There was a rare touch of tension in Jason's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's unlikely to endanger her life, but bleeding, intrauterine infection, organ damage, and other conditions can occur during pregnancy reduction surgeries... Given Mrs. Reed's current physical condition, there&rsquo;s very little chance of future pregnancies in the event of a miscarriage." The doctor laid out every possible case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face was grave. Having three babies was already risky, but they were now stuck in a dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was not difficult for him to make a decision. He cared more about her than the babies!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew how hard it was for her to get pregnant when he fell in love with her, and it was likely that they would never have children. He did not care at the time. Now, he would regret it a little, but he knew what he cared about the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then go ahead with the pregnancy reduction," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace vetoed quickly. "No! I don't want a pregnancy reduction!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned and glared at Grace. "Do you know what it means if you don't have a pregnancy reduction?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know!" She took a deep breath. "But now that I have a higher risk with the pregnancy reduction and I might lose all three babies, why don't I try to keep all three babies?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had a pregnancy reduction, though she would be safe, the babies were at risk. However, she would be in as much danger as the babies if she went ahead without the pregnancy reduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a lawyer, she should always remain calm and rational. She should know what was best, but she wanted to risk her life and bet that she and the babies could all be safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was because she... wanted so badly to be a mother and have a family of her own!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she ended up losing all her babies because of the pregnancy reduction, she would surely live in regret for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hospital&rsquo;s ultrasound room, Grace and Jason stared into each other's eyes. Both of them were standing their ground while the doctor beside them kept quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, Jason turned to the doctor nearby and said, "Give me a risk assessment report later. I want to know just how risky it is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, Mr. Reed," the doctor replied quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, in Brian's mansion. Patrick looked at his best friend who was sitting on the couch with a pale face and joked, "You&rsquo;re so unlucky lately. You were involved in a car accident when your hand had only gotten a little bit better. I heard you were involved in that car accident to save a woman. Could the woman be Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick talked about the gossip he had heard. Grace was the first person who came to his mind when he heard Brian had been trying to save a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that besides the woman Brian grew up looking for, Grace was the only woman Brian ever cared about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after Brian found the woman named Stella, he was merely nice to Stella but it was not the same as how he treated Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At best, he provided Stella with a lot of material things. Sometimes, there was subtle estrangement and indifference in the way Brian took Stella to parties. It was very different from the way he was with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, only Grace could make Brian do such a life-forsaking thing to save another person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian rolled his eyes at Patrick. "You're certainly well-informed."</p></div>
