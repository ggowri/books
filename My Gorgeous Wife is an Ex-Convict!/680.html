        <h1>Chapter 679</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his eyes seemed to be looking at another person even though he was currently facing the one before him. 'Substitute... Who was the substitute?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once, he imagined what the little girl would look like when she grew up. The women he found more or less had traces of the figure he imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing Grace, he felt as if he had seen the little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was not the one he had been looking for. It was this woman, Stella Lindsay, who saved his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had also seen photographs of Stella Lindsay growing up, and indeed, when she was eight or nine years old, she looked exactly like the little girl he remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the adult Stella Lindsay did not look like what he thought she would look like when she grew up. She looked somewhat similar to Grace, with similar eyebrows, eyes, and jaws, but when they were together, you could not mistake them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their auras were quite different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian?" Stella Lindsay's voice rang, interrupting Brian's trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian immediately came back to his senses. "You're not a substitute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Have you really been looking for a substitute? Or is it only something the tabloids made up?" asked Stella Lindsay as she pretended to be naive, acting like she was simply curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, could Brian, who was familiar with all types of people in the entertainment industry, not see through Stella Lindsay?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that time could change everything. He could not help but laugh at himself. He had longed for her for so long. However, now that he had truly found her, he was disappointed in a way that he could not even describe. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could time change the little girl, who was filled with a sense of justice at the time and who held his hand tightly without letting go in such a dangerous situation, turning her into this woman who was obsessed with money and status?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the information he found, the photo of Stella Lindsay, and the fact that Stella Lindsay still remembered what happened that year, forced him to accept the reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he had been too persistent and longed too much, so now his heart was like a pool of stagnant water. He did not even know what he wanted for the rest of his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. Here are your college admission materials. You can go through the relevant procedures tomorrow," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, all right." Stella Lindsay took over the materials but clung to the unheard answer, so she asked again, "Is the substitute thing real?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pressed his thin lips together slightly, and his dark phoenix eyes settled again on Stella Lindsay's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's heart was suddenly filled with guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're my savior, Stella. Therefore, I'll help you if you need anything, but some lines shouldn&rsquo;t be crossed. I wish you wouldn't cross them," Brian said lightly. The indifference and estrangement in his eyes surprised Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only now that it struck her that even if she had succeeded as an impostor, the man in front of her was not just any man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the crown prince who ruled the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes seemed to see her through. His words were more like a warning to her not to get too carried away and cross the line between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reason he was willing to sit and talk to her and do all these things for her was only because he thought she was his savior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If one day he found out she lied to him... Stella Lindsay suddenly dared not think about it anymore.</p></div>
