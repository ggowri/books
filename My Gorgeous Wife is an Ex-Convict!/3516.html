        <h1>Chapter 3514</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, I don't know what kind of misunderstanding there is between us, but I believe that my friend Mason would never plan a fake kidnapping on you!" Jasper said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What makes you so sure?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because you are the person that I, Mason, could never bear to harm no matter what. Even if it was true that I planned a fake kidnapping at the beginning, I don't think I would have gone through with it. Mason would never want you to be afraid, let alone give you any kind of drug!" Jasper said. "Besides, my mom is a lawyer. If Mason really did participate in planning the kidnapping, how could she agree to let him leave the country?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica suddenly shook. Yes, Auntie Grace's attitude towards the law was something she had been very clear about for many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Mason, if he really wanted to use some kind of scheme to reconcile with her, given his personality, he would choose more covert actions, just like... when he secretly agreed to the Cross family's conditions and made Daniel leave her, he didn't choose to directly attack her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why did Mason find them first in the beginning? And what was the reason behind it, even before the police and the Reed family's people?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, don't you believe me?" His voice rang in her ear again, and in her mind, she saw the indifferent and cold look he gave her yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be... Is there really a misunderstanding between them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her head was still hurting, and her body seemed to be getting hotter. Veronica couldn't help but sway, feeling her vision becoming increasingly blurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, what's wrong?" Jasper's voice sounded anxious. "Your face is so red... hey, you're so hot, do you have a fever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Her eyelids felt heavy, almost impossible to open. But she... she wanted to figure out whether she really misunderstood Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Jasper felt that he would never want to hurt her, but why did she assume that it was him who did it yesterday?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No... She wants to go and ask clearly. She wants to know if there's any misunderstanding in all of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as soon as she took a step forward, her body stumbled. Her legs seemed unable to support the weight of her body anymore. Suddenly, everything went black in front of her eyes and the last thing she heard was Jasper's anxious voice, "Veronica! Veronica, what's wrong with you?! Wake up..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason... Mason...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her final moment of consciousness, the only thing that flashed through her mind was that beautiful face, filled with despair and coldness. It was right in front of her, yet it felt like it was a million miles away and she couldn't touch it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once a misunderstanding forms, is it something that can never be resolved?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is there really a misunderstanding between her and him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica fainted, while at the same time, Mason had already boarded a plane heading abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze passed through the window of the plane, looking at the airport in sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his hand, he tightly held his phone, and on the screen, the contact list was displayed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a while, he turned his head and looked at the contact list on his phone, then selected the word "Veronica".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica, Veronica...</p></div>
