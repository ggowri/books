        <h1>Chapter 632</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and immediately understood what Jason meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jennifer Atkinson was the eldest daughter of the Atkinson family and was even the president of Atkinson Group back then. The Atkinson family had two daughters, but Lily developed her career in the entertainment industry while Jennifer Atkinson was groomed as the heiress of the Atkinson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, Jennifer Atkinson was Jason's fianc&eacute;e at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dexter Rios was probably afraid that the law would not sentence him to any punishment but that the Atkinson and Reed families would harm him instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Figuring that out, Grace was able to see why Dexter Rios would go to the trouble to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With all this evidence in front of her, Grace knew there was a good chance that the case would be reversed once they appealed. The only problem was that Dexter Rios was probably abroad now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she did get her case reversed, it would be very difficult to bring him to justice. After all, he was now in a country where it had no extradition treaty with their country.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if recognizing her misgivings, Jason said, "Don't worry, even if he's abroad, I'll make him come back and confess his crimes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was reassured. She knew he would do it if he said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After making sure there was nothing wrong with the appeal material, Grace signed her name on the document.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was all over, the lawyer who had previously led Grace said, "Grace, you've suffered a lot these years, but it won't be long before you can recover your reputation and become a lawyer again. When that time comes, you're welcome back here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled faintly but did not answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he tried to say more, Grace turned her head to Jason and said, "I'm a bit tired, Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go, then." Jason led Grace by the hand and left the people in the meeting room looking at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they got in the car, Jason looked at Grace and said, "If you're tired, just sleep in the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right." She shook her head. "I want to have a drink somewhere."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A drink?" He raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I just want a drink suddenly," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. Is there anywhere you'd like to go for a drink?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The bar. I've been there a few times when I was a student," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled. "Sure, let's go to the bar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The afternoon was not a busy time for the bar, but there were still some people there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason came to an ordinary bar, the same bar Grace used to visit when she was in college. She was a little surprised the bar was still there after all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, many of the shops around here had changed their names.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason took a seat and ordered some wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason opened a bottle himself and poured a glass for Grace. "Strong alcohol will hurt your body. This red wine is more suitable for women." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her glass and took a sip. She tasted a mixture of sweetness and bitterness, which after being swallowed, left a thick aftertaste in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Good wine indeed!</p></div>
