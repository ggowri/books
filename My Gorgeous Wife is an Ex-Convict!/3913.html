        <h1>Chapter 3911</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy sighed, "My sister just has a quick temper. She also hopes that I can have a better job."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Nancy speaking up for her, Clarissa quickly said, "Y-yes, that's right. I just wanted my sister to have a better job, and I acted impulsively."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Mick said with a smile that wasn't really a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes...it's true," Clarissa said, gritting her teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy lowered her head slightly. "I still have work to do, so I won't keep you two chatting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Nancy turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa looked at Mick, but found that he was staring at Nancy's departing figure, which made her feel jealous again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clearly, she was more beautiful than Nancy and dressed more gorgeously, while Nancy was still wearing a work uniform. Why should she be able to attract Mick's attention?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Reed, I'm glad to be able to attend the birthday party hosted by the Reed family today. I'm sorry about earlier..." Clarissa tried hard to strike up a conversation with Mick, not wanting to miss this opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You should be sorry. Someone who can slap his own sister can only imagine what kind of person he is. You really shouldn't have been invited to today's birthday party," Mick looked coldly at Clarissa and said, "Are you leaving on your own now? Or do you want me to have someone kick you out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Clarissa was stunned, almost doubting whether she had heard him correctly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is he... asking her to leave?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want me to say it again?" Mick said, "Get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa bit her lip unwillingly, but ultimately didn't dare to say anything more. She lowered her head and hurriedly left the banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did Mick lift his foot and walk in the direction Nancy had just left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy knew that her non-blood-related sister had always looked down on her. In the Schultz family, she had suffered a lot and only hoped that her mother could live more peacefully in the Schultz family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After graduating from college, she had her own means of making a living and moved out of the Schultz family directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For her, that home was too oppressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her stepfather's love for her mother was genuine, he didn't care much about her. In her stepfather's eyes, she was just an object that her mother had brought along, just an extra set of tableware in the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And her stepfather's love was also for Clarissa, in addition to love, there was also a sense of guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because her stepfather had promised Clarissa that he would not remarry after his wife's death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, within two years, Nancy's stepfather fell in love with her mother and married her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, when Nancy and her mother entered the Schultz family, Clarissa was hostile towards them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And if Nancy had any conflicts with Clarissa, it was often her own mother who suffered in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So later on, Nancy gradually learned to be patient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she never expected that even after moving out of the Schultz family, she would still be harassed by Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about what happened today, Nancy worried about how Clarissa would vent her anger on her mother after embarrassing herself in front of Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was also the reason why she spoke up for Clarissa before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want her mother, who stayed in the Schultz family, to be affected by Clarissa's anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You were hit, but not only did you not fight back, you also spoke up for the person who hit you. What were you thinking?" Suddenly, a cold and clear voice sounded behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy turned around and found that Mick had somehow appeared behind her!</p></div>
