        <h1>Chapter 3829</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your sister is right. When you have a girlfriend someday, you'll understand this truth," said Jason Reed, the head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick shrugged indifferently. "I'll find a girlfriend when I feel like I need one. But for now, I don't have that need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't dislike love. His parents had a loving relationship, and his siblings' relationships were also good. He just wasn't interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps in the future, he would fall in love with someone, get married, and have children. But for now, he didn't have that kind of desire and couldn't generate any expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like in school, where there were girls who expressed their interest in him, and even bold girls who would actively seduce him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't feel anything, as if he was watching a boring play. He had become a mere spectator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Grace expressed her concern to Jason, "Mick doesn't seem interested in women. Do you think he might be...?" She trailed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interested in men?" Jason finished her sentence for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, even if he really does like men, I wouldn't object. But if he never likes anyone, it's more like a kind of regret," Grace said hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least for now, he's not interested in women, but I haven't seen him interested in any man either," Jason said. "Don't worry too much. That kid always knows what he wants, and once he sets his sights on something, he'll see it through. He just hasn't found someone he's interested in yet. When he does, everything might be different."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Grace asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, just like when I met you," Jason's voice lowered as he leaned in closer to Grace's lips, gently brushing against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after all these years, Grace still vividly remembered the scene when they first met. When she caught his eye, she was already different from everyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he wouldn't have followed her home just because of a few words she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like it was "meant to be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jason," Grace whispered softly. Her husband always liked to tease her like this, and she often fell for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of which, you've been busy with that kid Mason lately, running back and forth between the hospital and the police station. It's been a while since you've needed me," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's face turned slightly red. This man was already so old, yet he still said things like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want me tonight?" His lips brushed against the corner of her mouth as his fingers slipped into her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm, I want you," she answered, holding his face in her hands and kissing him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after many years, he is still the only man she wants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although time passes and faces age, Grace still loves him deeply, and every day, this </span><span>love deepens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knows how deep it will go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night is long, and she will tell him how much she wants him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's injury was not as serious as Mason's, so she was discharged from the hospital earlier than Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, although she had completed the discharge procedures, Veronica stayed in Mason's ward, eating and sleeping with him, and helping to take care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, it was just a decoration because Mason had nurses and caregivers to take care of him. Veronica's main function every day was to chat with Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she still had to stay in the hospital for a while, Veronica took the opportunity to go home and get some clean clothes and daily necessities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when she arrived at her doorstep, she saw her father and stepmother desperately ringing the doorbell outside her house.</span></p></div>
