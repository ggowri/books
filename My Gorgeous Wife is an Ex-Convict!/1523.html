        <h1>Chapter 1521</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Despite having lost her memories, she still retained some of her knowledge bank. Even though she had forgotten she was once a lawyer, she still chose to become one and passed the bar exam with just one try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Yes, long time&hellip; no see.&rdquo; Lawyer Li seemed to have remembered something and his face changed. Was the person Irene Lynch wanted to file a lawsuit on Lawyer Cummins?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If so, Lawyer Li felt that this battle was already over. The master Grace had trained under was famous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Not only was his win rate for lawsuits high, but he was famous for being on the defendant&rsquo;s side. As for Lawyer Cummins, she was his favorite student. He once even declared that Lawyer Cummins would be his last protege!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After considering this, Lawyer Li felt his head ache as he looked at Grace with slight embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Huh, it turns out you&rsquo;re really a lawyer.&rdquo; Irene Lynch smiled coldly. &ldquo;Lawyer Yi, if you think this lawsuit is difficult to take on, there&rsquo;s no need to. But this woman didn&rsquo;t anger me, she angered Young master Reed. She made her own daughter say &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo; while holding Young master Reed&rsquo;s photo. If anyone heard that, people would think he has a bastard child. That would cause the Reed family and Reed group a lot of negative impact!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch deliberately brought Jason&rsquo;s name into this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lawyer Li was shocked to hear this and looked at Grace weirdly. He had heard that Lawyer Cummins was not married but had a daughter. However... to make her daughter call Jason &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo; while looking at his picture?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if Lawyer Cummins really wanted to find a stepfather for her daughter, she should not have used Jason&rsquo;s photo!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Did Lawyer Cummins not know Jason&rsquo;s power in Emerald City? Perhaps&hellip; Lawyer Cummins was just trying to entertain her child and simply used the picture of a man she found online?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just when Lawyer Li was still guessing, he heard Grace say, &ldquo;My daughter is not some bastard, she&rsquo;s the little young lady of the Reed family!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;What a joke! Little young lady? The Reed family&rsquo;s little young lady is my daughter, Wanna, you&hellip;&rdquo; Before Irene Lynch could finish, she heard her own daughter timidly say, &ldquo;Mr. Reed.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After that, Irene Lynch saw a familiar shadow step out from the police station. His suit was well ironed, and he had a cold yet exquisite face. It was Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Beside Jason was Terrence and a few other uniformed police officers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;Why is Jason here?&rsquo; Irene Lynch thought to herself. She nudged her daughter to go forward to cry and complain. If Jason was not pleased, this Grace, and any other women for that matter, would no longer have a footing in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before Oriel Lynch could go over to Jason, another tiny silhouette dashed forward to Jason and even threw herself at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, her tiny hands pulled on Jason&rsquo;s waist as she shouted with a clear voice, &ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This exclamation shocked everyone there, and Lawyer Li&rsquo;s mind was in a bigger mess now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch curled her lips in mockery, waiting for what would transpire next. Young master Reed really hated it when someone who was not related to him called him &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;. Even her own daughter, Oriel, did not have the permission to do so, what more a child who was completely unrelated?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason frowned and was about to pull the girl who was clutching onto his waist away. However, he then saw the little girl&rsquo;s face that was raised toward him. She had pink and tender cheeks with some baby fat. She had jet-black hair that was tied into two tiny braids, and she had bangs as well. She had a tiny nose, a pair of pink lips, and bright eyes. It made him realize something.</p></div>
