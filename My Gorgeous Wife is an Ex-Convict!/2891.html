        <h1>Chapter 2889</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The fact Valda Theller accepted was that she feared she would love him more and more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason and Brian returned to the ward, Grace was still chatting with Valda Theller about the children, not only the new baby but also the triplets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, Brian and I are going home first. Grace, have a good rest. I'll visit you and the baby again next time," Valda Theller said and got up after seeing the exhaustion on Grace's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied, "Okay. I'll let you meet my triplets next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Valda Theller and Brian left, Jason lay on Grace's bed and said, "If you're sleepy, sleep first. The doctor said you need more rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I'm a little sleepy, but I had a nice chat with Valda today. Jay, you know what? I think it's great that Brian has fallen in love with Valda. Valda's a wonderful woman, and Brian has finally found his happily ever after."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she slowly closed her eyes and fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at his wife's sleeping face, worry flickered in Jason's deep peach blossom eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wondered how Grace would feel if she found out Valda Theller had heard what Brian said after hurrying to the hospital for her that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would protect her and not upset her. If he needed to lie to her, he and Brian could continue the lies together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the hospital, Brian drove the car while Valda Theller sat in the front passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car was silent. Valda Theller looked down at her flat belly. 'Is there a little human life in here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ever since she discovered she might be pregnant, she had resisted pregnancy for fear of having a baby and getting even more involved with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after hearing Grace's various interesting stories about her children, she thought it would be good to have a child accompany her. Maybe she would feel less lonely and happier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's on your mind?" Brian's voice broke the silence in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "Nothing's on my mind. Did you and Mr. Reed talk after going out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He just mentioned Grace. He doesn&rsquo;t want Grace to be upset over us. I also told him I won't let Grace learn abou what happened that day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Okay. As long as we don't give ourselves away in front of Grace, she probably won't find out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think we won't give ourselves away?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It won't be for long. When Grace recovers, we'll make something up and tell her we had an amicable breakup," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The doctor said Grace requires long-term rehabilitation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... let's pretend for a little while longer. I'm not looking for a boyfriend right now... anyway," she said after pondering.</p></div>
