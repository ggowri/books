        <h1>Chapter 1128</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was going on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ran almost subconsciously toward the lounge door, only to feel her heart sink as she pulled the handle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door had been locked from the outside!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was this a set-up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By Stella?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Robert Brewer's gasping came closer, and he rushed toward her&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outside the lounge, Stella was still quietly letting the makeup artist do her makeup, but she was nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know if things were going well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had specially asked Robert Brewer to come over today. Then, she secretly spiked Robert Brewer's drink and asked Robert Brewer to hide behind the curtain in the lounge and wait for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, her excuse was that it would be bad for her if she was found to be close to him. Besides, deals like this should be carried out secretly and could not be discovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although her excuse was full of loopholes, Robert Brewer still believed her. After all, 50 million dollars was too attractive to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, according to Stella's plan, the drug would have taken effect on Robert Brewer after Grace entered the lounge. Then, she would bring Brian over to catch them red-handed. Not only could Grace be completely humiliated, but Brian would also get rid of Robert Brewer. Robert Brewer could not threaten her anymore by then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">More importantly, Brian would not show much interest in Grace by then. After all, how could a man like Brian possibly accept someone who had been seen in public doing such a thing with another man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not to mention the Hart family. A woman with such a scandal would not be able to even enter the door of the Hart family&rsquo;s house!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A smile appeared on the corners of Stella's lips as she thought of her plans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was a sudden commotion on the set. The smile on Stella's lips became more pronounced when she saw a tall figure walking toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Finally, Brian's here. The show's about to begin.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was now done with her makeup. She walked forward and said, "Brian, you're here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it so important that I watch this scene?" asked Brian. Although he disliked Stella, he remembered that she had once saved his life, so he would do whatever he could if it was not too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it is! Now that you're here, I feel more secure," said Stella. It was just that the scene she wanted him to see was not the one she was filming later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella approached to take Brian's arm as she spoke, trying to show that they were close in front of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before her hand touched Brian's arm, he dodged it! As a result, her hand missed and her posture became ridiculous and strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stella, don't do anything intimate to me that will give others the wrong idea. I only regard you as my childhood friend," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Stella felt as though everyone around her was looking at her with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was... telling people in public that they were just friends! In her presence!</p></div>
