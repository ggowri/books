        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect that he knew all of this. She thought he wouldn't pay attention to these things, but it turned out that he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know if finding this toy will improve the situation between you and Lawrence, or if his attitude towards you will change. But I want to share some of the burden with you. I don't want you to be troubled by certain knots in your heart. So, even if this toy was a gift you gave to Lawrence, and has a special meaning to both of you, I still want to help you find it!" William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suddenly hugged William and buried her face in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" he asked, lowering his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing, I just...suddenly wanted to hug you," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her with gentle eyes, raised his hand, and gently stroked her head. "Is it because of what I just said that made you feel uncomfortable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's just that...I feel like I love you even more!" she murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes darkened. "Then promise me, if I ever get jealous or envious, you'll tell me that you love me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment, her face turning red as she looked up at him with her almond-shaped eyes. "I...I wouldn't know when you get jealous or envious..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll be able to feel it, as long as you say you love me, everything will calm down and I won't think too much about it." He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked her eyes, seemingly thinking about what he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that okay?" He stared at her intently, waiting for Grace's answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face grew even redder, and her heartbeat seemed to quicken under his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Finally, this answer was softly spoken from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was excited to be attending a concert with Mason for the first time, which made her particularly happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she had long wanted to get closer to Mason, but in the past, Mason had very little time at home, so she didn't have many opportunities! Although Mason seemed cold and indifferent, not showing his emotions, perhaps because of their family relationship, she felt particularly safe with Mason by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine still remembers that at Harley's birthday party, they got into a fight with the Crypt families, and when they were fighting, she ran to call for help, and ended up calling Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Mason even didn't ask why, he just acted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, that fight also left Mason injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she felt extremely embarrassed and looked at Mason anxiously, afraid that he would hate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mason just rubbed her head and asked if she was hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, aren't you mad at me?" She asked nervously at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I blame you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I took you to fight and caused you to get hurt," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my sister," he said with just that one sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that sentence seemed to represent everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she truly felt that he was her brother and they were a family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the entrance of the concert venue, Tina looked at Jasmine and Mason. She didn't expect Mason to actually come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with his cold demeanor, he didn't look like he was there to watch the concert. He looked more like he was going to a funeral.</span></p></div>
