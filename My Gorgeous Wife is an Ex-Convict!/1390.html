        <h1>Chapter 1389</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss came back to his senses and hurried away with Paisley Daniels in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Daniels and Mrs. Daniels looked at Kyla Corbyn with malicious eyes, saying harshly, "Don't think it's all over. Our Paisley is much more precious than you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn coldly looked back at them with indifference on her face, but she kept her arms around her son. She pressed Nelson's face into her arms so that he could not see the ugly scene unfolding between the adults.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time she and Nelson got back to their house, Kyla Corbyn only felt exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Holding her grandson in her arms, Mrs. Corbyn's heart still fluttered with fear. "Okay, okay. You're back at last." She had been afraid something would happen, but luckily, her daughter and grandson were back safe and sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn let out a sigh and said, "Mom, take care of Nelson while I go in... and change my clothes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn paused for a moment. She noticed that her daughter's face was pale, and her hand was pressing on the right side of her abdomen. She immediately knew that her daughter was probably in pain again, but she only said such an excuse so Nelson would not notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Mrs. Corbyn hurriedly said, "Okay, okay. Hurry and change your clothes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn went back to her room and took out the painkillers the hospital had prescribed. She quickly swallowed the pill and curled up on the bed, waiting for the pain to pass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What had happened today would not end that easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With the scene the Daniels family had caused today, it would be a waste of their careful planning if things ended just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not do anything with her body like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">More than a month later, she even had to hand Nelson over to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can the Weiss family protect Nelson? What will the Daniels family do to Nelson? Nelson is still so young! He can't even protect himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What on earth can I do to protect my son? As a mother, I can't even protect my son... There's nothing worse than this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain continued and did not go away for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was growing resistant to the painkillers now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson, I... will protect you." Her eyes were shut, and large beads of sweat covered her forehead due to the pain. She was murmuring about the people she cared about the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Paisley Daniels got out of the operating room, the doctor said regretfully, "I'm sorry. We only managed to save the adult and not the baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Baby?" Martin Weiss was stunned. 'Paisley was pregnant?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's face was full of tears when she was pushed out of the operating room. She looked at Martin Weiss with teary eyes and cried out, "Martin, I wanted to give you a surprise. It was from three months ago when I... I got pregnant, but our baby... That's our baby... It's my fault. I failed to protect our baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels raised her fists and punched herself repeatedly as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had just undergone an operation. She was weak and could not hit herself with much strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stiffened as he stared blankly at the people in front of him. Paisley was crying her eyes out in front of him and looking so aggrieved, but he felt stumped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Three months ago...' He remembered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been agitated by Kyla Corbyn and drank some wine. After waking up, he found Paisley lying in his bed, her body covered in bruises.</p></div>
