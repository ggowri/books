        <h1>Chapter 897</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss once again felt breathless at the thought of Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" He rejected without thinking. "Marriage should be a happy event. A teardrop-like diamond sounds ominous!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing that, Paisley Daniels was unable to say anything more. She just said, "Well... Let's look at something else, then. Martin, what kind of wedding ring do you like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll see. Why don't we take our time picking out the ring after we announce the wedding date?" said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing that, a touch of disappointment flashed in Paisley Daniels's eyes, but she managed to put on an understanding smile. She said, "Then we'll just take our time to pick out the ring after announcing the wedding date."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels then picked out another pair of diamond earrings before leaving the jewelry store with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ask the driver to take you back later," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you?" Paisley Daniels was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have a few things to take care of. I'll call you later," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels could only nod her head, but as she stepped into the car, she asked nervously, "Martin, are we really setting our wedding date&hellip; on that day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Didn't you say it was an auspicious day? The elders have already made their plans, so of course, we'll set it on that day," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, the elders in our families have confirmed it. I have nothing to worry about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I will marry Martin and become the mistress of the Weiss family!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels smiled, responded gently, and got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The wedding date is set for six months later. I'll get everything I want&hellip; in six months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don&rsquo;t have to worry about Kyla!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Paisley Daniels left, Martin Weiss walked along the road alone until he came to a church.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a small church. Although it was located in a downtown corner, it was a sharp contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He went in and saw that the church was deserted at this hour. It was very quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the chapel, he walked to a statue of Virgin Mary, quietly looking at the kind Virgin Mary with a baby in her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had once stood in front of the statue for a long time, even shedding tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he had wondered why she cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "Because&hellip; I thought about Jesus's fate afterward... I'd be distressed if my child had to suffer someday. I think I'd kill to protect my child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was baffled, not knowing why she would think of this and even cry about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are women so sentimental?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were someone else crying, he would have been impatient, but her tears would only make him feel distressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even then... he had deliberately approached her. Everything was only a lie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that he and she would never have children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, later on, she told him she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Pregnant?' Even though he knew it was impossible, he felt a pang in his heart the moment he heard it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Children&hellip; She and I will never have any children! I even took precautions every time!'</p></div>
