        <h1>Chapter 1989</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I missed you very much... Don't. I have to go to the children's rooms and check on them. You're..." Grace tried to pull the zipper back up again, but he stopped her as soon as her hand moved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His lips seemed to be worshiping and kissing the fair skin on her back reverently and intently. If one looked closely, there were many fine scars that she had gotten from when she fell into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although many years had passed, those scars still let him know how close she was to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though he hated Secretary Wang, he still felt grateful to him for one thing. At least, Secretary Wang had someone save Grace and their children in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, he kept Secretary Wang alive and let him stay in prison for the rest of his life to atone for his sins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Fortunately, you're alive..." Jason could not help muttering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace trembled, knowing what he was referring to. "Is... Is my back ugly? It's been years. Luckily, I just got some scars on my back and all three children are with us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now that Mason had been found, she felt like she had no more regrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, you have a beautiful back... It's the most beautiful to me!" he said because it was also proof that she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She loved him enough to risk her life to save him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason kissed more intently, and Grace's skin seemed to be stained with a touch of pink, making it look extremely gorgeous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, Jason carried her in his arms and walked to the nearby bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hey, wait, I want to..." Before she could finish, he lay her on the bed, pressed his hands on hers, and interlocked them. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He lowered his head and bent down, his beautiful face inches before her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I can't wait any longer." He croaked with his attractive voice. &ldquo;I want you to tell me how much you missed me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was clear in his eyes that he wanted her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace felt that his gaze had captured her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, do you want it?" His lips kissed hers repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes..." The longing these days turned into desire. She began to take the lead, reaching the tip of her tongue out and deepening the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He opened his mouth and catered to her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was the only one in the world who could make him cater to someone like that. There would be no one else but her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In William's bedroom, Jasper ran over to sleep with William again. She was wrapped in her small blanket. She said she was afraid he would have trouble sleeping at night because he was not used to the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, she would come here to tell him bedtime stories to put him to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was always the first one to fall asleep!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked at Jasper Reed, who was already sleeping soundly beside him. His expression changed slightly. 'Actually... There are so many things I want to tell her. I want to tell her that I've learned a new musical piece, which is very difficult. She&rsquo;ll definitely be interested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Then I can play it for her and later we can play it together.'</p></div>
