        <h1>Chapter 3972</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick returned to the car, looking down at his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her warmth seemed to linger between his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the first person to use him like this, but he never hurt her in the end. He just warned her not to appear in front of him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers slowly closed, and a self-deprecating smile appeared on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was really in a sorry state!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he loved someone so much, but her use of him was like a bucket of cold water, leaving him cold all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mick, from now on, Nancy is just a stranger to you!" He warned himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the pain, time still passed slowly and steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy still works at the hotel, coming and going early and late every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gossip among her colleagues about her has also decreased, and everything is gradually becoming calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's as if Mick never appeared in her world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even often has the illusion that her relationship with Mick was just a dream, and now that the dream has ended, she has returned to reality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, there's trouble in VIP Room 7!" A colleague rushed over, looking pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy frowned and hurried to the VIP room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She works at a high-end hotel in Emerald City, and the people who book the VIP rooms are naturally wealthy and not easy to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nancy arrived at the VIP room, she saw two young female servers trembling with fear, and a young man with alcohol all over his head and spilled drinks on the coffee table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already learned from her colleague that someone had pulled these two female servers to accompany them for drinks, but the servers refused and pushed back, resulting in a scuffle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the servers, in a fit of anger, threw a glass of alcohol at the customer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the customer is not letting it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Nancy also recognized the customer who was splashed with alcohol, who is the second generation of a wealthy family in Emerald City, who is not short of money and is usually domineering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that it will be difficult to resolve this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, my two colleagues are new here. Please forgive them. I will have them apologize to you. If they have caused you any losses, we can..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was interrupted before she could finish speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to apologize, I don't need that kind of apology. As for the compensation you mentioned, how much do you think is appropriate? One hundred thousand? One million?" The other party sneered, "I don't even care about that amount of money. Today, I want these two women to experience what it's like to be splashed with alcohol. I've already bought all the alcohol in your hotel, and I'll have them splashed until I'm satisfied!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, please!" The two female servers looked at Nancy anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were really splashed with alcohol like this, who knows what might happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, your request is difficult for our hotel to fulfill. How about this, I'll go find our manager and you can discuss any 'reasonable' requests with our hotel." Nancy planned to calm the other party down first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the current situation was not something she could handle!</span></p></div>
