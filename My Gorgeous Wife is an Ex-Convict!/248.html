        <h1>Chapter 247</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sabrina Briggs only wished that she could be in Grace&rsquo;s position at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Jason bent over and leaned close to Grace's ear. He whispered in her ear in a voice that could only be heard by her, "Wasn't Sis wronged the last time you filmed? How about I help you show them who's the boss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Her almond-shaped eyes looked at him doubtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The extras around Grace felt wave after wave of shock when they saw this. Even an idiot could see that Grace and Jason was close. They all wondered what was Grace's background.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she the daughter of a rich family? Was she here as an extra to kill time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the rest who knew Jason's identity, the shock was more like a tidal wave. If word got out today, the gossip industry in Emerald City would probably have a field day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The big boss from Emerald City was so intimate with a little extra. How unusual!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lily saw this, she squeezed her red lips. A flash of worry and panic crossed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Evelyn, she gritted her teeth with hatred, knowing that her original plans for today would be rendered useless. Jason obviously had something to do with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought of how Brian had introduced her to Jason and the way Jason looked at her made Evelyn shudder. She had an unspeakable fear toward Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director asked the assistant director next to him a little awkwardly, "Young Master Reed's friend... Err, is that extra?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I suppose so," the assistant director responded though he could not believe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who is that little extra? How can she be a friend of Young Master Reed?" the director asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant director's face was ghastly. How would he know? "How about... I'll get someone to check it out later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Jason turned around and walked back to the director, saying, "Alright, you can shoot. I'll just have a look around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good," the director said hurriedly, but in a cautious tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director's back broke into a sweat at the thought of the time when Young Master Reed's &lsquo;friend&rsquo; had kneeled and groveled several times as a demonstration. It was all Evelyn's fault. However, if Young Master Reed was really going to start a fight, Evelyn had the crown prince to protect her. He, on the other hand, had no one. He would be the first to suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the director began filming while shuddering. He was hoping that Evelyn would not lose her head and find some way to pick on this little extra.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Jason just stood there, smiling and patiently watching the filming. He did not seem to be angry. It was as if he was really there to watch them shoot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director and the staff around him were a little relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when it came to the kneeling scene, Jason suddenly said, "Stop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director shivered as he looked at Jason. He said, "Mr. Reed, is there a problem?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think I remember that one of the actors said that the kneeling and groveling in this scene was not up to standard last time, so she got someone to demonstrate for quite a while, right?" Jason asked casually as if he was just talking about something casual.</p></div>
