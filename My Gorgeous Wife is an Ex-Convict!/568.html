        <h1>Chapter 567</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On Saturday afternoon, during Grace's break, she was dragged to a roadshow by her best friend Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know how hard it was for me to get these two tickets? Howell Webb is coming to the roadshow today, and he should know you. You must talk to him for me, at least have him take a picture with me," chattered Lina. It was as if she would be willing to brave through thick and thin just to catch a sight of Howell Webb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you come with Hadwin?" Grace asked in confusion. It would work better if Hadwin had come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina twitched her mouth. She was hiding this matter from Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If that fellow Hadwin knew she came to Howell Webb's movie roadshow, he would probably pull a long face for quite a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Last time, that fellow Hadwin made her drink just for Howell Webb's poster. In the end, she got drunk and her parents nearly pulled her by the ear to kneel on the washing board punishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Hadwin only made her drink the first glass. The second glass was because the wine tasted so good that she drank much more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Forget about it. If he came with me, would I still be able to see Howell Webb?" said Lina as she shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but laugh. "Is he against you fangirling?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, every time I fangirl, he looks like I owe him a lot of money," said Lina as she curled her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe he's jealous?" said Grace. Just like Jason who got very jealous because she was also a fan of Howell Webb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina acted as if she had heard a big joke. "How can he be jealous? The last thing he wants is for me to have another man in my heart before he gets his payback."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Only narrow-minded men would take revenge on women because they lost their virginity,' Lina thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was not going to say anything as she needed to experience love for herself. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Lina entered the venue. The seats Lina got were in the third row, which was pretty near the front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before the movie was released, the movie's creators would interact with the audience who came. Of course, most of the people who bought tickets for roadshows were fans of the leading actors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were even many fans holding up posters and name signboards of their idols to honor their own idols.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To Grace's surprise, Lina also held up a sign that said &lsquo;Jaygshan is the best.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think? I paid someone to do it," said Lina. She spent a lot of money on the roadshow today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not bad," said Grace. It did draw a lot of attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was time, the creators took the stage, and Howell Webb was one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were all kinds of applause, screaming, and shouting. The fans were desperately trying to get their idols' attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was of course one of those shouting and waving a signboard in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was actually a little envious seeing her best friend like this. She was introverted, especially because her three years in prison had turned her into someone as boring as a pool of stagnant water..</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not for Jason, perhaps she would still not have any hope for life now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina was different from her. She was very straightforward, her face was expressive, and she was willing to express her preferences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, Grace envied her best friend for that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her best friend, who was shouting at the top of her lungs, stopped suddenly. Grace heard the host saying, "Let's have our roadshow's special guest, Miss Cummins Evelyn, on stage!"</p></div>
