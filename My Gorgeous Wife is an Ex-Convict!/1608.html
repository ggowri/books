        <h1>Chapter 1606</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She won't become Young master Reed's weakness?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">An indescribable feeling filled Secretary Wang's heart. Old Master was afraid that Young master Reed's rival could easily manipulate him if he had a weakness, which might lead to the downfall of the Reed family. Therefore, his last words to him were to get rid of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Secretary Wang decided to save Grace at the last moment because Grace had chosen to sacrifice herself to save Young master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Five years later, the woman would still do the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason only felt something pressing on his chest after hearing what Grace said. He could not breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He instantly grasped Grace's hand. "Even if someone does use you to threaten me one day, I won't let you kill yourself! Do you hear me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Jason but did not answer him as he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace!" His voice unconsciously rose. He wanted an answer from her no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "Then we'll never let that day happen. Jay, at least I can promise you that I won't give up on myself until the very last minute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her and felt a sudden pain in his head. Something seemed to flash through his mind, but it was too quick and he could not grasp it! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang's voice broke the silence. "Grace, even though you&rsquo;ve said so, I can't tell you the whereabouts of the child because... they were already dead upon birth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How is that possible?" Grace asked in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why not? Where do you think the child is otherwise? I don't have any children here!" Secretary Wang said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stared blankly at Secretary Wang. 'The child...' Secretary Wang did not have any children around him, so... did her child actually die five years ago?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were born dead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though she... had thought of this possibility, it still hurt so much that she could not breathe when she heard it. It was too heavy for her to bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She remembered all three babies moving in her belly. She still...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace suddenly blacked out. She fell into familiar arms, and the last words that escaped her mouth were... "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I'm sorry. I'm a mother but failed to protect my child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I'm sorry. That child was supposed to come into the world but... didn't even get a chance to see it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As their mother, she only found out he or she no longer existed in this world five years later!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace fainted while Jason stared at Secretary Wang. "Is that child alive or dead? You'd better think it through before you answer. I'll make your life a living hell if you dare lie!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Does it matter whether they're alive or dead? I don't have any children here. That's all I can say. I won't tell you the rest," said Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together tightly, picked Grace up without a word, and walked out of the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence and those subordinates were waiting outside. As soon as he saw Jason coming out, he rushed forward and said, "Young master Reed, is Young Madam..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "She fainted because she got too emotional. Inform the police about Secretary Wang's whereabouts."</p></div>
