        <h1>Chapter 990</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&hellip; You don't want me anymore?" His thin lips parted and closed as if he had uttered the words with great difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't want him?' The words immediately made Grace feel like laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does he know who he is? How could I possibly afford such a man?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're drunk. Let me get up. It's late..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish, his face suddenly sank even lower. The tip of his nose almost touched hers. He was half-smiling and half-crying. "Drunk&hellip; Grace, I'm not drunk. I'm sober&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was enveloped in his scent. He kept repeating that he was not drunk. However, if he was not drunk, he would not be saying so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You won't refuse me, right?" he whispered. His voice was so hoarse, and something in his dark eyes that were full of pain seemed to be imploring her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if her answer meant so much to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew he was drunk and would not remember this the next morning. However, Grace could not help saying, "Jason, why are you telling me this now? You want me to want you, but it was you who didn't want me first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A look of repression came over his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her voice continued saying, "I said I wanted you because I considered you my family and also because I loved you, but I don't love you anymore. Therefore, I don't want you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, I don't love him, and I don't want him!' She was not only telling him this but also herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes turned red. Her words continued to irritate his eardrums, making it a living hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She doesn't love me, so she doesn't want me&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An endless panic swept through his body. It was as though he could not keep the person underneath him with him even though he was already trying his best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly lowered his head and kissed her hard on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No! I don't want this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could she?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mhm..." Caught off guard by the kiss, Grace raised her hand and tried to push him away, but his hands pressed hers to her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was almost breathless by the kiss. When the kiss was over, the hands that held her loosened slightly. She immediately raised her hand and slapped him in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of the slap rang in the tiny rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's cheek was turned to one side, and finger marks soon appeared on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gasped. The pain in the palm of her hand was burning. One could tell how hard she had hit him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed stunned for a good while. He turned his face over, and those misty peach blossom eyes fell on her face again. Then, he took the hand that had just slapped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace trembled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not be surprised if he wanted to break her hand for the slap she had just given him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, few people dared to slap a man like him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'There's nothing to be afraid of!' she closed her eyes and said to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had suffered far worse in prison with injuries so painful that it made her wish she had a knife with her to kill herself.</p></div>
