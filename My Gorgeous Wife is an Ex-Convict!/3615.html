        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Jasper couldn't just let them leave like that. She immediately grabbed them and said, "Don't leave yet. Explain yourselves. Who are you? Why do you know that I am someone's daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the people around slowly gathered, and the security guard at the entrance </span><span>also saw the scene and walked over, asking, "What's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper hesitated for a moment. In fact, nothing had happened. She just suspected that these two old people had some issues. But this suspicion was not enough to forcefully keep them here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not criminals, so why are you preventing us from leaving? I'm telling you, even if you're Jason's daughter, you can't do this!" the old lady exclaimed angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man said to the old lady, "Let's just go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper hesitated and didn't immediately let go of their hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard at the door recognized Jasper and knew that she was the eldest princess of the Reed family. In order to please Jasper, he immediately asked, "Miss Reed, should I call the police?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of calling the police made the old lady even more furious. She immediately retorted, "Do you really see us as criminals? Let me tell you, we are William's grandparents. We came here just to bring some fruits for our grandson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Jasper was stunned. They are... William's grandparents?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After knowing William for so many years, she had never thought about his grandparents. When William's mother Lily passed away, his grandparents didn't appear. It was the Reed family who adopted William, and he spent some time with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone rushed over and shielded Jasper, saying to Harold and Camelia, "That's enough from you. I don't need you to come see me, and I certainly don't need you to bring any fruits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at William, who had suddenly rushed over. When did William come back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, we just missed you so much, so... we came to see you," Camelia hurriedly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't want you guys!" William said, then he grabbed Jasper's hand and they didn't head towards the school, instead they got into a car that was parked nearby and drove away quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camelia couldn't help but cry, while Harold was busy comforting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the onlookers around them, some took out their phones and captured this scene. Surprisingly, some of them were students from Stanford University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting into the car, Jasper looked at William who was driving silently. At this moment, she had too many questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she finally spoke up, "Did you already know that they are your grandparents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly turned the steering wheel and slammed on the brakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car screeched to a halt by the side of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William turned to look at Jasper, "What if I said yes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome face was filled with a complex expression, and his voice became hoarse, as if he was desperately suppressing something, yet also afraid of something.</span></p></div>
