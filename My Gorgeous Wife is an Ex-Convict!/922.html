        <h1>Chapter 921</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" muttered Jason. The scissors were completely in his hand in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked down at the scissors in his hand, and there was a coldness on his expression. For a moment, he felt the urge to give her his life even if she did want it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How did that happen?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I never intended to give any woman my life. Only I can decide whether I should live or die, right? Isn't that what I was afraid of when I broke up with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why do I still have such an idea even after we&rsquo;ve broken up?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I've never thought about killing you." His silence made her misunderstand. "Even if we&rsquo;ve broken up, it was sad and painful at the beginning, but it's all over now. I won't kill someone just because we broke up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He furrowed his brows. She was only explaining herself, but why did it hurt him when he heard her say that it was all over?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've never thought about killing me?" He turned his head to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't want me to die, then?" he asked, his dark eyes looking straight into hers as if he was trying to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't want... Using those words makes it seem like something is going on between us.' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... don't want you to die," she said. 'Yes, even though we&rsquo;ve broken up, I&rsquo;ve never wanted him dead or anything. All I want is for us to live our lives well.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, even that seemed hard to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Therefore, you won't let me die, will you?" His voice was like the floating clouds in the sky, leading one into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I let him die?' Grace only felt as if the person in front of her was telling a joke. 'He's Emerald City's Master Reed. He has trillions of dollars worth of fortune in his hands. Is he someone a mere paralegal like me could kill?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not a matter of will or won't," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just tell me, will you... or won't you?" He insisted on an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could feel her heart beating faster and faster as he watched her. Almost subconsciously, her lips parted as she uttered the words, "I won't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The corners of his lips rose slightly, and slowly, a smile grew. Even his eyes seemed to be smiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you'd better remember what you've just said." As he spoke, he handed the scissors back into her hand. "Alright, go on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time the trim was over, Grace felt her hands freeze. Her stomach growled with hunger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then had dinner at Reed Residence. It was no different from before, but she would at times have the misconception that she was still dating him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought that she would be able to go home when dinner was over, but he kept her in the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was at the large desk in his study having a video conference with the company's senior executives, while Grace sat at a small desk, flipping through the case files she was working on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the same small desk he had bought for her when she wanted to revise the laws and cases.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was confused why Jason wanted to keep her in the study when he clearly had work to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she asked him about it earlier, he had said, "It's nice to have you around when I work. I feel a lot happier."</p></div>
