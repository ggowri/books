        <h1>Chapter 1085</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one shouted excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at the scene in front of her. She knew her son was truly happy! Nelson was shy and would not even talk to the people around him most of the time. He was more active when he was with people close to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was rarely so excited now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Martin Weiss... was dressed in a crisp suit and had a serious expression on his face, there was a touch of gentleness in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would respond to Nelson's excitement and go left or right as the little one instructed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could anyone have guessed that Weiss Group's president, who was usually known for his seriousness, would have this side of him too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's nose suddenly felt a little sore. 'Is this the nature of a father and son? Even though they&rsquo;ve just met and even though Martin Weiss wasn&rsquo;t a part of Nelson&rsquo;s life for the past four years, Nelson doesn&rsquo;t seem to see him as a stranger and accepted him easily.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was this the nature of blood ties?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long while, Kyla Corbyn finally said, "Alright, Nelson, we're going home. Grandma's still waiting at home!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one was reluctant to get off Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss handed the little one back to Kyla Corbyn, the gentleness on his face turned into indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled wryly. All he had left for her was indifference, but it did not matter as her feelings for him had also died out. It would be great for him to leave a bit of his gentleness to Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn led her son into the neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one looked back at Martin Weiss from time to time when they entered the neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, is Daddy not living with us?" asked the little one. The parents of the kids at the kindergarten lived together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, because... Daddy and I have been separated for a long time, so... we won&rsquo;t be living together," said Kyla Corbyn as she rubbed her son's small head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little one suddenly blurted out, "Did Mommy and Daddy get a divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was dumbstruck. "Divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lil Kai, who's in my class, has divorced parents. He lives with his mother. He says his father visits him every week," said the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Facing her son's serious inquiring eyes, Kyla Corbyn could only answer vaguely. After all, what should she tell her son? She and his father did not even get married. Nelson was only a b*stard child, not even a child born in wedlock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the truth was so cruel that she could not tell him no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Nelson did not ask any more questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back at their house, Kyla Corbyn handed Nelson over to her mother, packed up the things needed for her stall, and left with her stall cart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her thin body started the motorcycle and the three-wheeled stall cart chugged along, its contents swaying in the cart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not notice that not far away, Martin Weiss was in the car that had not left yet. He looked at her through the car window&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not sleep at night. Maybe it was because of the Splashes of Blood Jason talked about in the day that she could not help thinking about the Reed family's ancestor and the woman imprisoned here.</p></div>
