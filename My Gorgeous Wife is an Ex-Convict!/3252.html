        <h1>Chapter 3250</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Martin..." Kyla murmured, calling out to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kyla." He slowly uttered these three words from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her heart sank even further. She couldn't read his eyes and didn't know how much hate or love he still had for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you... lift the hypnosis on me?" she asked, her voice trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, what about you now..." She nervously opened her mouth, but halfway through her sentence, she didn't know what to say next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Do you want to ask him if he still loves her and wants her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she had already made plans to try to win him back even if they had to separate after he recovered, she suddenly felt anxious when facing him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla, what are you panicking about? She scolded herself inwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, there was silence between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you want to lift the hypnosis?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As I told you before, I don't want to live in constant fear that one day the hypnosis will be lifted and I'll have to worry about you every day," she said. "You gave me the power to choose, so this is my decision."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if now, I don't plan on being with you anymore? What will you do?" he asked her, looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze was filled with pain, repression, and many other things she couldn't understand, as if they were all mixed together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will pursue you until you are willing to be with me," she said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But no one can guarantee that you will be able to pursue me until I am willing," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then until we're old, until we die, anyway...you won't be able to shake me off in the future!" Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pursed his thin lips and after a moment, he said, "Aren't you afraid that I might fall in love with someone else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You won't fall in love because you've already fallen for someone else. But I believe that you will only love me, and as for me... I will only love you!" Kyla spoke, gazing at the person in front of her. "Martin, do you believe... that I love you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The feeling of being released from hypnosis is actually so uncomfortable. All those negative emotions that were once suppressed and forgotten suddenly flooded his body, while the warmth and beauty that were originally there... seemed to be in a tug-of-war with these negative emotions... making him even more miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the midst of that pain, there seemed to be a voice constantly saying, "Martin, no matter what happens, believe that I love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Believe that she loves him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But does she know how difficult it is for him to believe in those two words?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I have experienced rejection before, even sacrificing my dignity just to keep her, but it was all in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did she know that her heart died in that moment, turning to ashes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he hadn't been so desperate at that time, why would he have chosen hypnosis?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He would rather bury his feelings for her completely, as he didn't know what else he could do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, he never imagined that there would be these changes between him and her later on!</p></div>
