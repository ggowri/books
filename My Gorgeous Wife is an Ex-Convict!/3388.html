        <h1>Chapter 3386</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other end of the phone, there was a moment of hesitation before the person said, "Alright, I'll be there within 3 hours!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the call ended, Lornell looked at everyone and asked Brian and Valda, who were still in shock, "Anyway, someone from our family will come to save Harley. But if he wakes up, he will have to be engaged to me. Do you agree?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Brian and Valda looked at each other in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Brian could understand Hadwin's helplessness back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler added, "If the Quentin family is willing to save Harley, then there is a high chance he will wake up. The Quentin family has always been a famous medical family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the direct line is single, there are many branches. Each generation of the direct line of the Quentin family has amazing medical skills. Therefore, Hunter's elders even said that sometimes, God is fair. He gave the Quentin family the ability to save lives, but also made their bloodline thin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's a trade-off, but it's fair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can your family really wake Harley up?" Valda suddenly asked Lornell. Her voice was choked, and there were still tears on her face. But her eyes were full of hope as she looked at Lornell, as if she was looking at the last bit of hope, something extremely important to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Valda like this, Lornell couldn't help but think of his own mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the person lying in the ICU ward today was him, would his mother cry for him? And when she learned that someone could save him, would she show such a hopeful expression?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe she would, or maybe she wouldn't. But one thing he knew for sure was that even if his mother did cry, it was only because he was the heir of the Quentin family, not because he was her child. He had known since he was very young that his mother and father got married just to have an heir for the Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can he be saved?" Lornell said. If those old monsters in the family couldn't wake up Harley, he didn't know who else could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was strange that Valda believed this child who made the promise in front of her. But she took a deep breath and turned to Brian beside her. "Brian, I want to make a decision for Harley. I don't know if she will blame me if she wakes up and grows up in the future, but... I hope she can at least wake up first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a couple for several years, Brian naturally understood his wife's thoughts. He nodded. "Okay, but this decision is made together by us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So if their daughter were to blame them in the future, they would bear it together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at the other person with tears in her eyes, then nodded and turned to Lornell, saying, "Okay, Lornell. Aunt and Uncle promise that if your family can wake up Harley, you and Harley can get engaged."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell nodded his head and remained silent, patiently waiting for his family to arrive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler was surprised as he looked at Lornell. He never expected that when he asked Lornell for help, Lornell would end up getting engaged to Harley instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this matter were to be spread, it would likely cause a huge uproar within the Crypt families.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the Quentin family's status among the Crypt families was already exceptional.</p></div>
