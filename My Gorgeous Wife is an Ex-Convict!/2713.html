        <h1>Chapter 2711</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had imagined them having their wedding in the church, and she thought to herself when she kissed him... 'I do.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he would not know these, and she did not have to tell him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla lowered her head and continued eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dining table was silent as the two people said nothing. When they finished, Kyla tried hard to smile. "Alright, we're done. Hubby, get the check."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was shocked to hear her calling him that. He suppressed the strange sensation and called the waiter over so he could pay the bill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla continued smiling as she said, "Now let's go to the movie theater. I booked tickets for a movie in an hour. We'll walk there, and walking will help us digest the lunch we just had. It's killing two birds with one stone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lead the way, then." He got up and walked out of the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly ran after him, took his hand, and said, "Martin, why don't you smile? I don't think I've seen you smile much today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her coldly. "I only promised to spend the day with you today, but I didn't say I'd do it with a smile."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But a day with or without a smile is the same. Isn't it better to smile?" She did not want to recall him being so cold when she recalled the memory of this day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's unnecessary. Kyla, don't push your luck," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze. The words &lsquo;push your luck&rsquo; cut her heart like a sharp sword and put her in a lot of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that wanting to see his smile had become her trying to push her luck. It turned out they were now worlds apart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just had been unwilling to admit it and fantasized that he would have some feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see. Let's go," she muttered before leading him to the movie theater.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He watched her smile fade away, and he felt like there was something in his chest. His body silently condemned him as if he had just done something wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I did nothing wrong!' he thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not need to smile at her, and it did not matter what she thought. After today, the only relationship they had with each other was that they were parents of their children, nothing else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bought movie tickets for a romantic comedy. They were surrounded by laughter when watching the movie, but Martin Weiss did not feel like laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost all his attention fell on the delicate hand that held his right hand tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been holding his hand like this since she sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If walking hand-in-hand had been bearable to him, the sensation was stronger when she held his hand like this while sitting in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially when her finger would move from time to time. Her fingertips made him stiffen when they brushed across his palm. All the blood concentrated in his hand, and his body instinct seemed to be yearning for more of her touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her hand moved again and tightened her hold on his hand, he jerked it away to withdraw it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" she cried softly and held it harder as if afraid he might pull away. "Let me hold it for a little longer, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together tightly and hesitated. Just then, his phone vibrated. The next moment, he yanked his hand back, took out his phone, and almost fled out of the hall with it.</p></div>
