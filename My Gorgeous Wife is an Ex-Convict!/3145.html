        <h1>Chapter 3143</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Tracy finally saw a figure walking out of the residential area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy quickly got off the car and took out her phone to start her live broadcast. With a pitiful expression on her face, she said, "Today, I want to apologize to someone and hope that person can forgive me. Please wish me success, everyone..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In front of the camera, Tracy looked sad and helpless as she continued, "I know I made a mistake, and I regret it deeply. I hope this apology can make things right and show that I am truly sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, Tracy's eyes filled with tears, and her voice trembled with emotion. "I want to take responsibility for my actions and make amends. I hope that person can see how sincere I am and give me a chance to make things right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a deep breath, Tracy concluded her broadcast, "Thank you all for your support and encouragement. I will do my best to make things right and learn from my mistakes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying the prepared words, Tracy got off the car and quickly caught up with Valda, saying "Miss Theller, please wait a moment!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda turned around and her expression froze when she saw Tracy. She was completely caught off guard by Tracy's sudden appearance in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Theller, I came here today to apologize to you." Tracy said while pointing her phone's camera at Valda, clearly wanting the audience in her live stream to have a better view of Valda's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda instinctively avoids the other person's gaze and says, "I don't think there's anything to say between us, is there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could there not be? At the film festival the other day, Miss Theller, you accidentally fell and I didn't help you up in time. I'm truly sorry, it wasn't intentional. I didn't know you had difficulty with your legs. I really hope you can forgive me, Miss Theller. I don't want my true passion to end like this. Please forgive me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy was in tears as she spoke, crying uncontrollably and shedding tears as if they were free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the live stream room, those netizens who were originally mocking her began to gossip and became curious about Valda's identity. After all, Tracy's words implied that this apology was related to her entertainment career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some netizens also said, "Is it true that someone's entertainment career can be ruined just because they fell down and no one helped them up? It sounds like a fantasy to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, what's this woman's identity? She doesn't look like a rich and beautiful person at all! Does she have some kind of hidden background?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy's fans are frantically sending gifts in her live stream and shouting, "Don't cry, Tracy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My family's Tracy is so wronged. Is it fair for her to be banned just because she doesn't know how to do it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They haven't done anything wrong, yet they have to beg for forgiveness from others. How pitiful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy is performing in front of the camera. Yes, she is using public opinion to pressure Valda into compliance and get through the current crisis first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, as long as she can control the public opinion, this can even become a bargaining chip for her and Brian in negotiations. If Brian can help the Barlow family get out of this crisis, she can naturally clear Valda's name later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda may not have realized all the complexities in Tracy's mind at that moment, but one thing she was certain of was that Tracy had ill intentions towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, she looked directly at Tracy and said, "Miss Barlow, I didn't accidentally fall. Your companion deliberately tripped me. As for you not helping me up in time, no one in this world has to help me up just because I fell. But it seems like you intentionally prevented me from getting up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy's eyes were filled with tears as she said, "Miss Theller, how could I possibly have intentionally prevented you from getting up? Before that day, I didn't even know you."</p></div>
