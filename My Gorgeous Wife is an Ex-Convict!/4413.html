        <h1>Chapter 4411: Teasing the Rabbit</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in all black, strutting across the stage, they were like a beacon of light.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he and his outfit seemed to complement each other perfectly, making it impossible for people to look away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this stage, he's like a king.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stared at Calvert on stage, somewhat taken aback. She had seen him at his lowest before. Initially, when he was introduced to the world of modeling, she thought his looks and height were more than enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, for her, it was just a spontaneous act of kindness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who would have thought, he was like a raw gem, gradually radiating a glow that was uniquely his own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the fashion show ended, thunderous applause erupted from the audience, and Calvert became the most talked-about model among everyone!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley arrived backstage, where Calvert had already changed into his own clothes, but he hadn't removed his makeup yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The makeup on the stage is much more intense and vibrant than what you'd see in movies or TV shows. It's a stark contrast to his usual no-makeup look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially his makeup, it gives off a chilling vibe. And on stage, his gaze, his expressions, they all perfectly match this makeup, exuding an extreme sense of cold severity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But oddly enough, he was now wearing such makeup, yet looking at her with bunny-like eyes, creating a strong sense of contrast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pretty refreshing!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... wait for me a bit, I'm going to remove my makeup first," Calvert said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait up!" Harley grabbed him, "Why the rush? Let me take a good look. You don't see makeup like yours every day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was blushing profusely, feeling as if he was about to burst into flames under Harley's gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks were burning hot. If it weren't for her heavy makeup, Calvert would probably have noticed her blushing!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, it was a private changing room, so only Harley and Calvert were in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley gently hooked his finger under Calvert's chin, tilting his face slightly upwards. "You on stage just now, and you right now, feel quite different. How do you manage to display such extreme contrasts in your expressions?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I just followed the designer's instructions, trying to create the... the vibe they wanted," Calvert stammered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, when you were on stage just now, it was as if you were glowing. It was impossible to look away. But you seemed so cold and distant, as if you could only be admired from afar, as if you were untouchable." She murmured softly, her fingers gently tracing his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was rigid, his thin lips slightly parted, cherishing the warmth of her fingers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, you seem so approachable," she said, her face slowly moving closer to his. "Do you know? When you look at me like this, it's hard to resist the urge to tease you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was slightly taken aback, his eyes questioning?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's with his look?!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Harley's lips were about to touch his.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert could only feel his face getting even redder, "Someone... someone might come in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this place is currently his to use, there's no guarantee that no one else will come in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's okay, we're a couple after all, everyone knows we're dating." As her words fell, her lips met his in a kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems like she's becoming more and more proactive now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made her experience... well, the joy of teasing a little bunny!</span></p></div>
