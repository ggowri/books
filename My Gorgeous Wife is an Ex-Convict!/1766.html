        <h1>Chapter 1764</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's hands hurt even more now. Even though she wanted to say more, the pain made her clench her teeth hard as sweat continued to pour from her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason carried Grace into the car and instructed the driver to go to Dr. Russell's clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence arranged for someone to bring Mason to the hospital they had contacted earlier for examination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed's young face was full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Uncle Klein, are Mommy and Lil Bro in danger?" the little one asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"With your daddy around, I'm sure they'll be alright," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But..." The little one bit his lip. "Daddy seemed worried just now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had never seen his father like that. His father was more worried now than the time when their kindergarten teacher said that his sister was missing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if his father would go crazy if something really happened to his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Inexplicably, that was what Mick Reed felt at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's because your daddy loves your mommy so much," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He loves her so much?" The little one's eyes flashed with confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You'll get it when you get older. Your mommy is so important to your daddy that the more he cares about her, the easier it is for him to become flustered,&rdquo; said Terrence. He was secretly praying that Grace would be safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even after five years and even though Young master Reed's memory had not fully recovered, his feelings for Grace had only grown deeper and deeper. It was the same as&hellip; five years ago!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If Grace&rsquo;s hands became crippled because of this, the Reed family would probably start a feud with the Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Emerald City would probably be hit by another storm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell's clinic was an ordinary one, just like so many of tMason Swansonty's smaller clinics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, many cars had surrounded the clinic at this moment, and none of these cars were cheap. It made the passersby look at this scene curiously as they wondered what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A group of men dressed in black suits got out of the cars. The sight of these strong-looking men made their imaginations run wild. They even thought the clinic owed some loan sharks money, who came to collect the debt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was only when a man got out of the car and hurried into the clinic with a woman whose face was contorted with pain and whose hands were trembling badly that everyone realized&hellip; these people were here to see the doctor!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who could make such a commotion just to see a doctor?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the clinic, Dr. Russell was giving a prescription to one of his old patients.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The patient was joking around with him, saying that Dr. Russell was wasting his skills here in a small clinic like this. He would be making a lot more money if he could treat big shot patients in major hospitals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Big shots?" Dr. Russell curled his lip. "It's not like big shots won't come to my clinic."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Come on, you're just boasting. What big shots will come here? The old women from the market or the street vendors?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before they could finish talking, the door to the consultation room was pushed open. Jason rushed in with Grace in his arms. A group of men in black filed in behind Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell froze. Before Jason could speak, he had already seen that someone was wrong with Grace and hurried forward to check on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
