        <h1>Chapter 4126</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And for such words, Kit was already used to it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he decided to enter the entertainment industry, he knew he would encounter all kinds of people. Even in the same group, it was not guaranteed to find true friends. Most of the time, they were bound together due to temporary mutual interests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Someone who genuinely cared for him... In Kit's mind, Tina's face suddenly appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She liked him, appreciated him. Her eyes were so clear and honest, as if all impurities did not exist on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Every time he saw her, he felt himself gradually relaxing, as if the tension within him was slowly easing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew that his father gave Tina two concert tickets. When he stopped at the entrance of the concert earlier, he wanted to see if she was there, if she had really come!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But after stopping, he realized that he couldn't quickly find her in the dense crowd of fans!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, everyone, we'll be on stage soon. Get ready." The person in charge of the concert quickly entered the dressing room and addressed everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit composed himself. He shouldn't think about Tina now. What he needed to do was to give this concert a perfect ending!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It's her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She really came!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Kit stood on the stage and saw Tina in the middle of the third row, a indescribable feeling surged in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was like joy, as if he had been anticipating this for a long time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was looking at him, at his dance moves, at his every gesture, and then listening to his singing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though this performance was meant for the fans in the entire venue, in this moment, it felt like he was performing only for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if there had never been a performance that allowed him to be so fully immersed, so passionate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tina, don't you think Kit's eyes are always fixed on you?" Eugenia whispered to her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In this kind of setting, because of the voices of other fans around, they didn't have to deliberately lower their voices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina also felt this way. It seemed like Kit was always staring at her during his performance. Initially, she thought it might be her own imagination, but since Eugenia also felt the same way...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then it shouldn't be just her imagination!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Has Kit recognized her? Tina silently wondered. After all, she was wearing a hat and a wig now, and she had put on makeup. Plus, her seat was not very clearly visible due to the stage lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eugenia said before that even if her parents came here, they wouldn't recognize her in her current disguise!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I think he might have recognized you," Eugenia's voice reached Tina's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina rolled her eyes helplessly. Eugenia, don't you think that statement is a slap in your own face?</p></div>
