        <h1>Chapter 1814</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm fine," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But you don't look very well." She reached her hand out to his forehead as if out of habit while she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, Hadwin Stephenson's expression suddenly changed and he waved away Lina's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was stunned for a moment, her hand still hanging in mid-air. Hadwin Stephenson seemed stunned too. He spoke a little weakly, "I... I&rsquo;m feeling a little under the weather. You shouldn&rsquo;t touch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because he could not endure the pain her touch would bring him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina bit her lip and said a little awkwardly, "Okay, got it." As she spoke, she withdrew her hand and straightened herself. She even deliberately distanced herself from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson opened his mouth as if wanting to explain. Ultimately, he did not say anything... </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the blood curse was completely removed, he would tell her everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Finally, when it was Lina's turn, she walked into the consulting room. After determining how far along she was, the doctor arranged for her to receive an ultrasound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina suddenly had a strange feeling as the ultrasound instrument moved across her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if she had just realized she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"All done," the doctor soon said to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"All done?" She froze. So soon? She did not even feel that much time had passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, all done. Tidy up your clothes and wait for your report," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina got down from the bed, straightened her clothes, and stood aside. After a few minutes, the doctor gave her the report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It showed the length of the fetus, the number of heartbeats per minute, and two screenshots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The screenshot seemed just like a small circle to Lina, but... it was the life in her womb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina took the report and walked out of the ultrasound room. She read the simple words on the report again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is this... my baby?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Having a heartbeat meant it was now a human life. Was she going to kill a human life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson came up to her and asked, "How's the check-up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's alright," she said as she handed him the report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He took the report, looked at it, and glanced at her belly. He seemed to want to reach out and touch it but stopped a few centimeters from it. He withdrew his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at Hadwin Stephenson in confusion. There seemed to be desire in his eyes, but also repression and restraint!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he had a desire to touch her belly and feel the little human life, then why was he repressing and restraining it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After coming out of the hospital, Hadwin Stephenson said to her, "Do you have anything else to do today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No." She shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then I'll take you home," he said and instructed the driver to drive to the Sweeney family's apartment building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked away. She looked at the scenery along the way, but all she was thinking about was how Hadwin Stephenson had waved her hand away today, as well as the look of repression and restraint in his eyes when he had wanted to put his hand on her stomach.</p></div>
