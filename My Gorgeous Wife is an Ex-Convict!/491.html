        <h1>Chapter 490</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But I can see that Mr. Reed treats you very well. You have reaped the good fruit you sowed,&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Reaped the good fruit? Perhaps. Right now, my relationship with Jason is getting better. It feels as if we have gone back to the time when we were living together in the rented house.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, there was still some difference. At that time, she merely saw him as a younger brother. Now, she saw him as a lover, a person whom she considered giving him the reins to her future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Kyla, you also have reaped the good fruit. Nelson can now hear sounds and he may be able to speak soon. Next time, he can be like any normal child, studying and making friends.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, Nelson is my life. As long as he&rsquo;s well, I don&rsquo;t mind going through any hardships.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said so and looked at Grace. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not yet a mother. When you become a mother, you&rsquo;ll understand that as a mother, you&rsquo;ll be willing to sacrifice anything for your child!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Be a mother?...&rsquo; Grace looked at her flat abdomen and wondered if she would have a chance to be a mother in this lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the hospital, Grace thought about the day she had intercourse with Jason. They had not used protection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Subsequently, she could not help from chuckling. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s with me? Am I afraid of getting pregnant?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her current condition, she could not get pregnant even if she tried. Even if they had not used protection, there was no issue there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, if she did get pregnant, was that not her wish? To become a mother? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back at the Reed Residence, it was still early and Jason was not back yet. Grace planned to browse her phone for a bit to read the news when her phone rang. The called ID showed it was from Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace answered the call. On the other end of the call, Lina&rsquo;s voice resounded, &ldquo;Grace, can you, um, come to bail me out from the police station?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nearly choked on her saliva and stood up abruptly from the sofa. &ldquo;What happened? Why are you at the police station?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Um, something happened. It&rsquo;s a long story. I don&rsquo;t want to alert my parents that I&rsquo;m in lockup now. You know that with their age, they tend to blow things out of proportion.&rdquo; Lina&rsquo;s voice sounded rather awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll come over right away. Which station are you at?&rdquo; Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After receiving the details from Lina, Grace got the Reed family&rsquo;s driver to send her there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the police station, Grace rushed inside. She informed the police about her visit and was brought to another room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the room, Grace saw her friend sitting at one end of a large table that was in the center of the room. On the other end was a man and a woman. The woman looked like she was about 25 to 26 years old while the man looked like he was in his 30s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man was quietly scrunched in a corner while that woman and her best friend were in a staring match.</p></div>
