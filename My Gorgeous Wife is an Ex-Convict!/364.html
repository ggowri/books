        <h1>Chapter 363</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; He grabbed her instantly. &ldquo;Are you mad? I didn&rsquo;t mean to look down on your job with what I said just now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him weirdly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad.&rdquo; If she were to be mad about this, she would have died from anger a long time ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If you want to, I can find a better job for you,&rdquo; Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Hart, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re that close. You don&rsquo;t need to help me find another job. I&rsquo;m perfectly happy with what I&rsquo;m doing now,&rdquo; Grace said and glanced at his hand that was holding hers. &ldquo;Can you let go? I need to deliver these.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dark pair of eyes stared at her. After a while, he finally let go of his hand. Not close? However, he knew her better than she knew herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew about her past from his conversation with Evelyn. He knew everything about her, from her youth to her adulthood&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re happy with what you&rsquo;re doing now?&rdquo; He chuckled softly. &ldquo;A former lawyer is happy with being a delivery person?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s eyes became dim. Lawyer&hellip; It sounded so far away from her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting on her battery-powered bike, she heard Brian&rsquo;s voice again. &ldquo;It seems like there&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t know between you and Jason. If you can&rsquo;t stay with him anymore, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to come to me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body tensed up. Then, she drove her bike away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she left Jason, she would not go and look for the young master of the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man like him would be crueler than Jason. It was not like she had never met his ex-girlfriends. He spoiled them rotten when they were his girlfriends, but when they broke up, he was so cold that it was horrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had a lot of ex-girlfriends too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for his current girlfriend, Evelyn&hellip; Grace read about her current news in the newspaper and magazines. It seemed like she had some amazing resources. Some media even predicted that Brian might try to support Evelyn as the best actress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was interested in Evelyn&rsquo;s future with Brian. She just did not want to get involved in the rumors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If possible, she just wanted to live her life peacefully and ordinarily. That would be her biggest dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Brian was watching Grace&rsquo;s figure disappearing from his vision. He eventually unclenched his fists. He looked at his palm. He was reluctant to let go just now when he needed to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he specially came to this restaurant to look for her, he cared about whether she would be mad at him for doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was just a woman. He was only concerned about her because she looked like the little girl in his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian&rsquo;s eyes went back to their usual coldness. He walked back to the restaurant to pay for his bill. He asked Mrs. Corbyn at the counter nonchalantly, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the cashier lady who was here earlier?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;She&hellip; She&rsquo;s in the kitchen,&rdquo; Mrs. Corbyn answered after stammering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not say anything more. Before he left, he looked at the kitchen as if he was in deep thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Brian left, Mrs. Corbyn walked into the kitchen and said to her daughter, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was not relieved. On the other hand, she said, &ldquo;Did he say anything when he left?&rdquo;</p></div>
