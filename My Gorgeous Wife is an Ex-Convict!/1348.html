        <h1>Chapter 1347</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of being angry like her mother, Kyla Corbyn seemed calm about it. "Mom, just because I donated my bone marrow doesn't mean they must donate their liver to me. I just wanted to save a human life back then. They have the right to choose whether they want to save me, and there's no need to blame them for the decision they&rsquo;ve made."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just wonder... Why are you so unfortunate?" Mrs. Corbyn put her arms around Kyla Corbyn and burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn consoled her gently. "Mom, stop thinking about these upsetting things. Think more about happy things! Whether you spend the day happily or unhappily, it's one day crossed off the calendar. So why don&rsquo;t we spend these six months happily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn nodded as she sobbed. "Okay... Let's spend it... happily... I&rsquo;ll stop thinking of such heartless people!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gently wiped the tears off her mother's face. Instead of resenting God for being unfair like before, she only regretted that she could not spend more time with her mother and Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, Paisley Daniels was glaring at the reasonably good-looking man in a private room of a club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man was her ex-boyfriend, but she had broken up with him after she got her hands on Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't we agree not to contact each other after breaking up? Why on earth do you want to see me now?" snapped Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't want to contact you, but I recently got an interesting phone call. I thought you'd be interested to hear it," Shane Currey said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phone call?" Paisley Daniels was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"An old mother called, saying her daughter has liver cancer and she needs a liver transplant to survive. She also said her daughter had once donated her bone marrow and she wants to contact the person who received the bone marrow transplant through the hospital. She wants to ask if they would donate their liver to her daughter," said Shane Currey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Paisley Daniels listened, the more her brows furrowed. Her expression changed when she heard the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does... Kyla Corbyn have liver cancer and wants to contact Martin Weiss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No. If so, then Martin will find out that the person who donated the bone marrow to him is actually Kyla Corbyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And I&rsquo;ll end up...' Paisley Daniels trembled, hardly daring to imagine it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, should I put that old mother in touch with the one who got the bone marrow transplant?" asked Shane Currey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want?" Paisley Daniels asked through gritted teeth. She had known that he must be up to something when he asked her out today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard you're going to be the young madam of the Weiss family soon, Miss Daniels. I happen to be tight on money recently. Surely, you won't be stingy, Miss Daniels?" said Shane Currey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's just trying to blackmail me!' Paisley Daniels hated it, but she had to agree to his demands for now. "Ten million! Don't contact me anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ten million? Is the position of the young madam of the Weiss family only worth ten million?" His eyes showed a greedy look. "It has to be worth at least 50 million. 50 million and I won't show up in front of you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels snapped. "50 million? Where do you expect me to get 50 million all at once?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's not my problem. I want 50 million in a month. Otherwise, I'm afraid you won't be able to hold your wedding, Miss Daniels!" said Shane Currey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was silent for a long while before saying, "I'll give you 50 million. Don't show up again. Otherwise, let's all die together. I'll sue you for blackmail, and you can only stay in prison for the rest of your life!"</p></div>
