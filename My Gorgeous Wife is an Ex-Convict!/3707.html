        <h1>Chapter 3705</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crispin breathed a sigh of relief when he saw this. It seemed that Mason didn't take Veronica seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to embrace Veronica eagerly when suddenly a hand came out of nowhere and stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Mason pulled Veronica behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, what are you doing?" Crispin looked at Mason in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost." Mason coldly spat out these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said that, Crispin's face stiffened. After all, he was the young master of the Toyar Group. Being told to "get lost" like this in front of everyone was a huge blow to his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, this woman doesn't know her place. She was just trying to seduce me earlier, but as soon as she saw you, she clung to you and cried for help. She's obviously trying to set a trap for you. I'll take her back and teach her a lesson!" Crispin said as he tried to grab Veronica again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!" Mason said again. "Don't make me say it a third time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crispin's face turned ugly, but he thought of Mason's identity and decided to leave. He glared at Veronica and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until this moment that Veronica finally relaxed, feeling the comforting breath of air around her nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thank goodness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason... he really saved her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her thoughts became more and more hazy, and finally, she couldn't bear the drunkenness in her body anymore. She lost consciousness and fell down. In her daze, she felt a pair of arms holding her, and the breath that enveloped her made her feel extremely safe...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason carried Veronica horizontally and walked towards the hotel exit, while the people around him looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they didn't have much contact with Mason, they had heard rumors that he didn't like to be close to women. So, they didn't bring any female companions to the banquet. But now, Mason had just picked up this woman and carried her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's the relationship between this woman and Mason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd speculated in their hearts, while Mason held Veronica and got directly into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drive." Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we going back to the Reed House?" The driver in the front seat asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed his lips, "No, we don't need to go back to the Reed House, go to..." He pondered for a moment and reported the address of Veronica's current residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that she had moved back to the house her mother had left behind, and he naturally knew the address of that house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because once, before the Reed family found him, he lived there with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver drove the car to the entrance of an old community, and Mason carried Veronica out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was where he used to live, and even after so many years, many places were still so familiar to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason carried Veronica to the door of her house and looked at the electronic lock on the door, which was password-protected.</span></p></div>
