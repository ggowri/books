        <h1>Chapter 3656</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next evening, Jasper went to Stanford University again to have a good talk with Lawrence. After all, they didn't talk much during their short meeting yesterday!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really wanted to know how he had been these years and wanted to learn more about Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she arrived at his classroom, she learned that he had already left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Left? Do you know if he went to the school cafeteria or back to his dorm?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He seems to have gone to a bar outside of school with several boys from our class," the other person said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know which bar?" Jasper asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not very clear," the other person replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Jasper rushed out of the school gate and began searching for Roger in the bars near the school, one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she reached the third bar, she finally found Roger inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sitting on a large sofa, lazily leaning against the backrest, holding a tall glass in his hand and drinking slowly. Around him were excited men and women drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed somewhat out of place with his surroundings. Although he was drinking, he gave people the feeling that he was sober while everyone else was drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father was right. He was no longer the same person he was as a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a child, Lawrence was always shy, like a little rabbit. Many times, he didn't even dare to speak loudly, giving people a feeling of being too submissive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it also made her want to protect him involuntarily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to want to protect him. Whether it was him as a person or his musical talent, she wanted to protect him well. She even thought that he could become a great pianist in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she didn't protect anything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Jasper's heart sank. She lifted her foot and walked towards Roger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lawrence, I want to talk to you alone," Jasper said, her clear voice almost drowned out by the noisy music and chatter around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger slowly raised his head and looked at Jasper, "Who are you calling? I told you, I'm not Lawrence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper licked her dry lips and said, "Okay, Roger, can you talk to me alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the boys who came out with Roger recognized Jasper. Two of them whistled, and one of them jokingly said, "Grand Princess, why did you come to find us instead of your boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grand Princess" is the nickname that Stanford University students gave to Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls from other schools looked at Jasper strangely after hearing the nickname "Grand Princess." One of them even mocked, "Is she a princess from some country? Why call her Grand Princess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course she's a princess!" A boy replied, "She's the Grand Princess of Reed Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls present had all heard of Reed Group, the leading conglomerate in Emerald City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, their faces showed surprise, obviously not expecting Jasper to have such a big background.</span></p></div>
