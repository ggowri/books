        <h1>Chapter 2740</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and Kyla quickly helped Grace, while two bodyguards raced ahead to make way for them. The five of them quickly got into a car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew she should not panic. The more she panicked, the more emotional she would be. She would only put the baby in more danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to take deep breaths to adjust her breathing rate. Then, she instructed the bodyguard in front of her, "Call... Call Jay and tell him I'm on my way to the hospital because my belly's not feeling well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," the bodyguard answered and quickly made the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not give any other instructions because she knew Jay would arrange everything well after finding out about her condition. When she arrived at the hospital, she only had to accept the doctor's examination and treatment without worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gripped one of Valda Theller's arms. It was painful, but she said nothing because she knew Grace was suffering more pain than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I'm sorry. It's my fault that this happened to you," Kyla said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, it's none of your business. The baby's... not in the best position to begin with, and I was prepared to risk my life to give birth to them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay will have everything ready for me. I'm sure I can keep this baby. I'm sure..." she muttered with increasing difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hurriedly said, "Okay, okay, stop talking. Try to save energy and rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stopped talking and closed her eyes, but her deep frown and pursed lips indicated that she was still in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a paper towel from one side and wiped the cold sweat breaking out from Grace's forehead. She had envied Grace's pregnancy, and Brian had scolded her that there was nothing to envy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian already knew Grace would be in danger if she gave birth to the baby. That's why he was so angry when I said I was envious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Brian knows that Grace is currently in danger, what will he... do?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart ached as she thought of the pain the man might suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, the car finally drove to the hospital. The hospital ambulance team was already waiting. The medical staff put Grace on a stretcher before quickly wheeling her into the hospital. Kyla and Valda Theller also followed hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was given emergency treatment in the emergency room while Kyla and Valda Theller waited outside in the hallway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller touched her wrist and looked nervously at the closed door, praying that Grace would be okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, what happened to your hand?" Kyla asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? It&rsquo;s n-nothing," Valda Theller hurriedly said vaguely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla grabbed Valda Theller's hand and looked at the bloody streaks. Her skin had been scratched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she recalled how Grace seemed to have been holding Valda Theller's wrist earlier. Grace must have caused the scratches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller was silent all the way. She had no intention of mentioning it even now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace gave you these scratches, right? Why didn't you say anything when we were on the way here?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It wasn't that painful. Besides, Grace was in a lot more pain than I was. It would help her cope with the pain if she held my hand," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla became a little fonder of Valda Theller now.</p></div>
