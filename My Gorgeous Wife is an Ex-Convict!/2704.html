        <h1>Chapter 2702</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack turned to look at Patrick as she spoke, "Patrick, say something!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick said as if it had nothing to with him, "Since you did something wrong, the court will decide your sentence accordingly. Isn't it a given?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Patrick?" Queenie Mack could not believe her ears. She did not expect him to say that. "But... But I'm your girlfriend. Are you going to let me suffer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Girlfriend?" Patrick suddenly sneered. "I don't think I ever said we were a couple, right? When did you hear me introducing you to my friends as my girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack was speechless. 'Indeed, he never said so.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she was his girlfriend because she was the only woman with him during this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she increasingly thought she mattered to him. If she had a good grip on him, it would not be difficult for her to marry into an affluent family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought we were supposed to be on the same page, but you seem to have misunderstood something," Patrick added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... What am I if I'm not your girlfriend?" Queenie Mack mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're just an escort. We could both get what we need from this relationship. I thought you were smart and sensible even though you were a little wilful. But it seems I overestimated you," Patrick said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack looked like she was struck by lightning. 'I'm just an... escort? I'm nothing more than someone who accompanies him when he needs me. How ridiculous it is to think that I smugly thought Patrick was my backer.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I love you!" Queenie Mack roared with a sobbing tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You love me?" Patrick chuckled as if he had heard a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You really aren't smart enough. Do you think others can't tell what you love? It's over between us," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack panicked. If it was over. She was dead meat. It was all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Patrick, I do love you. Please believe me. I don't want it to be over. I..." She kept begging, but Patrick had pressed the call bell. The club&rsquo;s staff soon arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get her out of here, and never let her enter this club again," ordered Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Mr. Weiss." Two staff members took Queenie Mack out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The private room was instantly quiet again, and Patrick smiled nonchalantly. "I'm sorry you had to see that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd also laughed, and the escorts that the heirs brought over today looked as if nothing had happened. It was as if what had just happened was nothing unusual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was the only one who could not hide the shock on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rumors had it that Queenie Mack had a backer. Queenie Mack got so many good resources because her backer promoted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought Queenie Mack's backer should at least have some feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, how could Patrick have any feelings for her when he could readily say it was over between them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, Queenie Mack laid a hand on you, Valda. Speaking of which, this is my fault. I made her unscrupulous. I'm sorry. If you're still mad, tell me how to make you feel better. I'll do my best to do it," Patrick said in a friendly manner.</p></div>
