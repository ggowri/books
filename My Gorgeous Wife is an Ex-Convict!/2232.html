        <h1>Chapter 2230</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A chill ran down Jacqueline Bowman's back. "Mister&hellip; Mr. Weiss, did Kyla say something to make you misunderstand? I... I'm not trying to use Kyla for anything. I just&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before Jacqueline Bowman could finish speaking, Martin Weiss said, "You and I know full well whether I misunderstood you or not. And don't have any funny ideas in front of me. I'm not interested in women like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman instantly blushed, feeling deeply insulted. "A-Aren't you just fooling around with Kyla too? Are you really interested in someone who has been to prison-like her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes suddenly darkened. "If I hear you talk about Kyla's imprisonment again, I&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;ll never talk again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman shuddered as fear rose in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to say that the man was joking, but his eyes made it very clear that he was not. He was serious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had heard from Neal Reid that something happened to Mr. Lambert's company after the incident in the private room. Several big business deals had fallen through. Though the Lambert family did not say what had happened, Neal Reid guessed that perhaps Martin Weiss was sabotaging the Lambert family. Otherwise, there was no way things could be so coincidental! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Martin Weiss left the buffet area, Jacqueline Bowman was still standing blankly in the same spot. Her palms and back were covered with cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why? Why isn&rsquo;t Martin Weiss interested in me? Kyla is no match for me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman felt a surge of anger and jealousy. Then, she seemed to recall something. She quickly walked to the corner, took out her phone from her clutch bag, and dialed a phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, is this Mr. Lambert? I'm Jacqueline, and I'd like to tell you something..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Martin Weiss walked over to Mrs. Corbyn and Kyla with the plate in his hand. He handed the plate to Kyla. All the food he took was relatively light-tasting. He avoided raw and cold food, hence everything on the plate was suitable for pregnant women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss also brought Kyla a warm glass of a multigrain drink. "Let me know if you feel tired later. I'll ask the driver to take you home to rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Martin Weiss turned around and sat at another table nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze slightly. She understood that he was keeping his distance from her because he remembered her saying she was scared of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked down and ate the food Martin Weiss brought over. Her slightly lowered eyelids concealed everything in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was unusually lively around Tina Stephenson. The parents of families with little boys led their sons to Tina Stephenson, wanting desperately to make their faces known. If Tina Stephenson did anything special like smiling or babbling as she grasped their sons&rsquo; hands, these adults could say they were destined for each other or something of the like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the one-month-old Tina Stephenson only slept soundly in her cradle. No matter how busy it was, she did not wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina grabbed her husband and muttered, "What's going on? Why does the full moon party for Tina seem like a blind date party?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The parents not only took their sons to Tina Stephenson but also Lina. The rich ladies kept praising their sons in front of Lina, and Lina's ears hurt from all that talk about the accolades they had received.</p></div>
