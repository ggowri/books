        <h1>Chapter 565</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to see me cry, I'll cry." His voice once again rang in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes widened in shock, and her face was in disbelief. Did he say... He would cry?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" he asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to see it, I'll do it. I'll try my best to do whatever you want," he said as he bent down slowly, his handsome face suddenly enlarged in front of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at his face that was so close to hers. Her face was reflected in his dark pupils. He smiled and talked with a serious expression as if all she had to do was say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and he would cry and shed tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you?" His voice rang again in her ear. His whispers were like the most touching sweet nothings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head and replied, "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her answer put a flash of doubt in his eyes. "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I'll be distressed. If you cry, it means you're very upset, and I don't want to see you upset," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes gleamed. Her words were like a warm current, flowing into his ears little by little and seeping into his heart and lungs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The world was full of people who wished him bad luck. Most of his friends respected and feared him, and his father had loved his mother so much that his father gave him little love. As for his mother, he was just a pawn for her. A pawn that would grant her access into a rich and powerful family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, when he could not play any role as a pawn, his mother turned away and no longer cared for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his grandfather's eyes, he was only the only choice for the heir of the Reed family because he had half of his father's genes. The other half of his genes that belonged to his mother was rejected by his grandfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, his grandfather often looked at him with disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All the while, he told himself he had to be strong because if he was not strong enough, he would be devoured by the world and have no place to stand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the woman in front of him said she would be distressed for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was... The woman he fell in love with. She was probably the only person in the world who would be distressed for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kissed her lips tenderly, turning and sucking as if he was going to finish all his love in this lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Only you, Grace... I only have you..." He had always been alone in the world, and now, there was her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her around, he would not be so lonely&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, when Grace returned to the small restaurant after delivering food, she found Brian sitting at the table in the small restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked over to Grace's side and whispered, "Brian has been here for a while. He's here for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Grace walked to Brian's table and met his eyes. "How can I help you, Mr. Hart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I forgot my manners last night," said Brian. Yesterday was the day the little girl carried him down the hill and also the day he was separated from her.</p></div>
