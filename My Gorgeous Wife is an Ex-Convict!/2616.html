        <h1>Chapter 2614</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The domineering possessiveness was only because of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only one who made him possessive of her. He did not allow anyone else to covet her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His kiss almost drowned her in it. She managed to cling to a sliver of reason. "Jay... Don't... Don't go on. I'm not in the right condition to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know. I'm not going to do anything. Grace, I just want to kiss you and let you know how much I love you!" His magnetic voice was alluring. His breathing, eyes, and embrace was enchanting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was drowning increasingly deeper...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said&hellip; he would get over her. He said that earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because he wanted her to be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since it was her repeated wish, he would make every effort to fulfill her wish. Even if the fulfillment... was only an illusion, he wanted to make it happen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The so-called illusion was that all the people around him thought he had moved on. Of course, she thought so too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moving on... Perhaps not moving on no longer held any meaning. Moving on was the best thing to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it meant nothing to him. Her existence had become some sort of spiritual support for him for so many years. If he moved on, what would he have left?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian drove aimlessly. When the car stopped, he found himself in front of the noodle shop where Grace used to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the noodle shop had become a small restaurant, and the name on the signboard outside had changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had once asked Grace to be a substitute for the woman he was looking for at the noodle shop entrance. It was ridiculous that he had asked the real deal to become a substitute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told him that she would not become anyone's substitute. He kept on looking for substitutes, but they could never replace the real deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was right about that. He was only repeating the same mistake by finding so many substitutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when he went abroad, he met Whitney Cooper who looked 70 percent similar to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the closer he got to these women, the more he felt that they were not her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian parked his car in front of the small restaurant and walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was almost dinnertime, and the dining tables in the restaurant were occupied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The owner enthusiastically walked forward, asking if he was willing to share a table with others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll share a table," Brian said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the man led him to a dining table where only one person was occupying it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian sat opposite the person and randomly ordered a donburi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to eat anything. He only wanted to come in and sit down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh. It's you." A clear female voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked up and saw a round apple-shaped face.</p></div>
