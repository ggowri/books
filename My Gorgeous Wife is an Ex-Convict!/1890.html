        <h1>Chapter 1888</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My mommy harmed your mommy and your brother. Maybe I'll harm you too," he said with a rare look of inferiority. No matter how much others bullied him, he would not show such a look of inferiority in front of them. He would only feel inferior in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why would you harm me?" Jasper blinked her round almond-shaped eyes, looking adorable and innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes met her almond-shaped eyes. She was carefree like a pampered little princess. He should hate her because she was keeping him in the most inappropriate place. He was just her toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he could not hate her and even wanted to stay by her side longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because they said my mommy harmed your family and I&rsquo;ll harm you too," he said. Not only did the people at the kindergarten say this but the maids in Reed Residence often said it in private too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You won't harm me!" Jasper shouted back without any hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why are you so sure?" Even he could not help wondering whether he might harm her when he grew up. His mother killed herself because she harmed others, but... without aunt Cummins and the Reed family, she would not have died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because we're best friends!" said Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William froze. She seemed to stubbornly think that they were best friends and did not think about how different they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Can she and I... really be friends?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace quietly watched as she stood by the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not know what would happen to the two children, but at least she hoped that the previous generation's grudges would not be carried over to the next generation. She wished they would get along like they were now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The children were asleep, but Grace was still awake. She felt cold no matter how warm the bed was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She only realized how big the bed was and how empty the room was when Jay was not around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace went downstairs and sat down at the empty dining table where she and Jay had drunk the vegetable beef soup that night. He had drunk mouthful after mouthful of the spiked soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although she had made up an excuse and told the kids that their father was on a business trip, she could sense that Mick was suspicious. He would occasionally look at her with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to find Jay and ask for his forgiveness, but she did not even know where he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, she heard footsteps behind her. Grace trembled and subconsciously shouted, "Jay!" However, she was disappointed when she turned her head. It was Uncle Kwan who came over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Uncle Kwan, it's late. Why aren't you in bed?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Madam, Young master Reed is probably in the old mansion on the outskirts of town," said Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Old mansion?" Grace was surprised. She froze when Uncle Kwan told her the exact address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The mansion was the one Jay had taken her to. It was also the mansion where Jay's great-grandfather and great-grandmother fell in love with each other. It was the mansion where Old master Reed grew up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Did Jay... go there?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How do you know?" Grace asked Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I had this speculation after Terrence ordered me not to send anyone to clean the old mansion for the time being," said Uncle Kwan. After all, he was responsible for having someone clean the old mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now that there was a sudden change in the schedule and Young master Reed was not around these days, it was only natural for him to have such speculation.</p></div>
