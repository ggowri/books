        <h1>Chapter 940</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She eventually learned from her eldest brother that Grace had Jason as her backup, and she suffered all these because of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fearing that Jason would continue to take revenge on her, her family sent her abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when she was abroad, she still kept her eye on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She learned that Grace had moved out of Reed Residence and was currently living in a small rental house. She was also only working as a mere paralegal in a law firm. As such, she concluded that Jason must have dumped Grace and that was why she returned at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She planned to get back at Grace a few days later and make her crippled as well so that she could get rid of the hatred in her chest. However, she did not expect to see Grace at the banquet first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who are you with this time? You probably went all out to get in here because you want to approach Jason. Just look at you! Jason was momentarily interested in you. Now, without Jason, you're nothing. Do people like you have the right to stand here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe snarled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ignored Zoe. She caught a glimpse of Sean and Lily walking over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking about it now, it was only natural to see them at a banquet that was full of Emerald City's socialites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Lily was no longer a popular actress, she was still the second daughter of the Atkinson family. She seemed as conceited as ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she had walked up to her, Lily said with a smile, "What a coincidence to run into you here. Congratulations on your case reversal, but the Atkinson family doesn&rsquo;t owe you anything for this. It was the judge who found you guilty, after all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked so conceited. It was as if the word &lsquo;congratulations&rsquo; was an act of charity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said lightly, "Really? But you do owe Jennifer justice. Speaking of which, when the heiress of a family like the Atkinson family died in an accident, why didn't you look into it? Or did the Atkinson family just want a scapegoat like me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Lily's expression changed a little as she sized up Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Zoe told me that Grace has broken up with Jason, but why is Grace here wearing such an expensive gown and jewelry?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be&hellip;' Lily had a bad feeling about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Sean just stared at Grace in a trance. She was wearing a light purple dress with a pearl necklace, making her look so poised and elegant. She looked different from how she previously looked like in a fluorescent uniform while holding a broom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was even more radiant than she had been before she went to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had known she was beautiful, or else he would never have courted her and dated her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her beauty was not the eye-catching type, but a comfortable quiet elegance. The more you looked at her, the more comfortable you would feel. It was like a gurgling stream, instead of raging seas or rivers, that would seep into your heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought of the last time he went looking for her regarding Lily's blacklist incident. However, she had only looked at him coldly. There was no trace of their past affection in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Well, he did give her up like she was a sacrifice.</p></div>
