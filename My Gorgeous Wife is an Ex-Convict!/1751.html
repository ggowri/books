        <h1>Chapter 1749</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Instead of feeling the pain as expected, Grace heard Rosalind Bush's cries. "My... My hands are going to break..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Archer Barlow happened to come out of the house at this moment and saw a stranger gripping his wife's hands. His wife's face had turned crimson as she cried out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who... Who are you guys? L-Let go of my wife!" shouted Archer Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the stranger who was holding Rosalind Bush's hands did not move and ignored Archer Barlow. He just looked at the other handsome man standing beside him as if waiting for his orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Archer Barlow naturally saw that the handsome, elegant, and indifferent man in a dapper suit was the one in charge, so he said, "Ask him to let go of my wife, or I'll call the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You can try calling the police, then." Jason glanced coldly at Archer Barlow, which made him shudder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did not expect Jason to come so soon. Her eyes instantly reddened. "Jay... Mason has really been kidnapped!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even just by overhearing the conversation, she could figure out what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "We'll find him. Are you alright? Did this woman do anything to you just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Grace could speak, Veronica Barlow, who was being protected by Grace, said, "My stepmother wanted to beat me up and aunt Cummins helped me stop her. She twisted aunt Cummins's hand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as Veronica Barlow said that, the pressure around them instantly lowered. It was as if the air had turned cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"She hurt your hand," Jason said as he held Grace's hand and checked it. "Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It hurt a little earlier, but it's better now," Grace said nonchalantly, not wanting Jay to feel guilty about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had been feeling guilty about her hands for a few days now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As for the wrongs committed by this woman named Rosalind Bush, she would make her pay the price for all of them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason turned to look at Rosalind Bush. His delicate peach blossom eyes were filled with intense rage. "You deserve to die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Rosalind Bush was frightened by the rage in Jason's eyes but still said stubbornly, "She wanted to protect the brat. What... What does it have to do with her when I'm teaching my daughter a lesson..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason did not bother to listen to her nonsense. He ordered his subordinates, "Do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The bodyguard, who had been holding Rosalind Bush's hands, snapped them. Rosalind Bush instantly screamed and almost fainted from the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did not expect Jason to be so decisive. However, she did not sympathize with Rosalind Bush. She was only worried that Veronica Barlow, who was in her arms, would be scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Archer Barlow was so frightened that he immediately hugged Rosalind Bush. The neighbor next door heard the noise and opened the door to see what was going on. Jason ordered, "Clear the place and make everyone on this floor leave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Clear the place?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Archer Barlow was shocked when he heard these words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, he noticed that a group of people had formed a circle in the corridor. They were surrounding him and his wife, making it impossible for their neighbors to see what was going on.</p></div>
