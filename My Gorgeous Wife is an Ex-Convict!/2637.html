        <h1>Chapter 2635</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He must be trying to reassure me not to worry!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought to herself. Then, she smiled and said, "Thank you for the kind words. I hope he'll take the role. But it doesn't matter even if he doesn&rsquo;t. I'm content enough that my creation can be adapted and is given additional investment because they have high hopes for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glimmered slightly. Her smile was still full of contentment. 'Contentment is bliss?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What would become of a woman like her if she became greedy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if he found her to be greedy one day, maybe it was time to end their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the date was over, Brian returned to his car alone and called his secretary. "Get someone to contact Gloria and tell him to accept the comic adaptation role he was recently offered.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary could not help pausing. 'Get... Gloria to accept a comic adaptation? President Hart shouldn&rsquo;t have to personally give orders on such a small matter, right?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting an affirmative reply, the secretary hurriedly replied in acknowledgment. They were still a little stunned after the call ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why does the Mr. Gregoryddenly care what projects Gloria is accepting? Gloria is just an actor in one of the company's subsidiaries. Though he's doing well lately, it's not enough to attract President Hart's attention.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several speculations flashed across the secretary's mind, but there was no conclusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Chang Mingyu looked at Raymond Bowman. "I heard you've invested in a comic adaptation by Valda Theller."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman looked at his best friend. "You're well informed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How generous of you. Didn't you want to meet Valda Theller? Have you met her?" Chang Mingyu asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Raymond Bowman said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? What's with that look on your face? She didn't use your guilt to get you to invest in her adaptation, did she?" Chang Mingyu said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She didn't want to use me for anything." He might have felt better if she wanted to use him. "She said she doesn't hate me, but she won't forgive me either. She now has a boyfriend she loves very much and wants me to be strangers with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chang Mingyu was startled. "She has a boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman did not answer the question but said, "Mingyu, do you think I&rsquo;ve unconsciously grown feelings for Valda Theller?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should ask yourself that question. What feelings do you have for her?" Chang Mingyu said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman was silent. He wanted to know what feelings he had for Valda Theller too. He could not get her out of his mind even after all these years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The memories of them together and when she was bullied and laughed at school seemed deeply engraved in his head. He could not erase or forget them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller said that she loved her boyfriend deeply, he felt heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it possible? Is it possible that I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with Valda Theller after all these years? But if I don't love her, why does it hurt?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No matter what feelings they are, I'll find out in time!" he said. She did not want to meet him, but now that he had invested in her adaptation, she could not avoid him.</p></div>
