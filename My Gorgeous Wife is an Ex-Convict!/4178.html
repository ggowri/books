        <h1>Chapter 4176 Bargaining</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina frowned, "What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Of course, I want Miss Stephenson to pay a price," Mr. Perkins said. "If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have ended up being wanted by the police!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> That was entirely his own fault! Tina silently criticized in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But to avoid provoking Mr. Perkins even more, Tina swallowed back her criticism.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I didn't expect you to be wanted by the police, but I can find a way to get you out of the country and give you a large sum of money, no less than your previous wealth," Tina said. "You must understand that I have the capability to do it. After all, I am the Miss Stephenson of the Stephenson family and the wife of the Hunter family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I understand that Miss Stephenson can do it, but I don't trust Miss Stephenson, so I need some assurance from her," Mr. Perkins said maliciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina asked, "What kind of assurance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I kindly ask Miss Stephenson to undress completely right now, and then I'll film a video with my phone. Miss Stephenson just needs to say a few things to the camera," Mr. Perkins said, repeating the words Tina was supposed to say to the phone camera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina felt disgusted listening to it. It was completely obscene language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Well, considering Mr. Perkins was such scum, what good could one expect from him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "As long as I have this video, I won't worry about Miss Stephenson changing her mind. Once I'm safe, I'll naturally delete this video," Mr. Perkins said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Unfortunately, Tina didn't believe a single word he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> All she could do now was buy time, delay until her parents and Chandler came to rescue her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "This is quite difficult for me. Can I have some time to think about it?" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Sure, but I have limited patience. I'll give you ten minutes," Mr. Perkins said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Alright, ten minutes is better than nothing. Tina then pretended to have a conflicted expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia, on the other hand, couldn't stop berating Tina, calling her names like "fool" and "idiot," saying that if she agreed, she would only be ruining herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was dumbfounded. How could Eugenia not worry about herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If she didn't come, she would be completely useless and most likely be torn to pieces!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Mr. Perkins actually enjoyed watching Eugenia berate Tina, so even though Eugenia kept insulting her for ten minutes straight, Mr. Perkins didn't shut her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When the ten minutes were up, Mr. Perkins asked, "Have you made up your mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Um, about the sentences you asked me to repeat, I think it's necessary to discuss them. For example, the first sentence has a grammatical issue, and the second sentence is too clich&eacute;... Also, you asked for eight sentences, but I think three would be enough. After all, you just want an assurance!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia, who was tied up, felt like there was something wrong with her ears when she heard Tina's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This... um, bargaining with the kidnapper?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And it's even bargaining over how many sentences to say?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Tina, at this moment, naturally continued to procrastinate, pretending to have a few things to say and not being able to remember the details, making Mr. Perkins repeat them several times until he got really angry. Then she reluctantly remembered those few sentences and started discussing with Mr. Perkins whether she could keep her undergarments on and offer him more money...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#12288;&#12288;Even Mr. Perkins himself didn't expect to be so overwhelmed by Tina.</p></div>
