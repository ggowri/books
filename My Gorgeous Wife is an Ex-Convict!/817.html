        <h1>Chapter 816</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were pressed together in a straight line, and he looked at her quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I... don't want to think about you anymore. I won't think of you anymore from now on..." she continued to mumble as if she was speaking out the words that were buried in her heart through her drunken state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It turns out&hellip; it&rsquo;s so easy for you not to love someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me. Which of us&hellip; Uhh... Has betrayed the other?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I should also thank you&hellip; for today. Thank you for saving me... and paying the bill for me... but... I... I have nothing to offer you...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I... I can give you something in return... and that's... to get off your back. Don't worry. I'm not... Not someone who keeps pestering others..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She babbled, unaware that every word she said was hurting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a tightness in his chest that made him feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'We've broken up. I don't love her anymore, but why... does she seem to be controlling all my emotions?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words and silly smile were still able to cause him pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. Stop!" his thin lips finally blurted out with much difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, let&hellip; Let me just say one last word, one last... word..." she mumbled, tiptoeing lightly. Then, her lips just pressed against his thin lips, kissing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a soft kiss. Mixed with the alcoholic smell and warmth of her body, it spread out on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was so stiff that he forgot to give a reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kissed him intently and carefully as if she wanted to put all her feelings into the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the longer the kiss lasted, the more flustered he became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart could not help beating wildly. Even the hand around her waist trembled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... am I afraid of?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is there to be afraid of?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The woman in front of me is just a woman with no fighting power!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was afraid, very afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know how long it took, but the kiss was finally over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the moonlight, she tilted her chin back, gave him a sweet smile, and said, "Jay, I'm going to forget about you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop it. Stop saying that!' he cried out in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her voice went on. "I can... Forget about you... Forget... all my feelings for you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying this, Grace fell headfirst into Jason's arms and had completely blacked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared blankly at the person in his arms, but his body could not help trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a silver car suddenly stopped at the roadside, and a figure quickly got out and ran toward Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, what are you trying to do to Grace?" Lina said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she came over, she saw her motionless best friend being held by Jason on the side of the road. She panicked instantly.</p></div>
