        <h1>Chapter 3070</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was already lacking in self-confidence, and now... she's afraid that this feeling of inferiority will only get worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At times like this, it may not be helpful to rush things. It might be better to wait for Valda to work on her own psychological development before facing Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, Brian's driver pulled up to the entrance of a restaurant and led Camille to a private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian is already inside the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille walked in and Brian said to her, "What do you want to eat? Order for yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Camille absentmindedly ordered a few dishes and looked at Brian's almost emotionless face, which was much colder than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to before, Brian was now much colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he was frozen in an icy abyss, devoid of all emotions, except for a hint of humanity when talking about Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How happy would this man be if he knew Valda was still alive?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille secretly thought that Brian could help Valda feel less insecure and let go of her worries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you looking at me like that? Is there something on my face?" Brian's voice suddenly rang out in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille suddenly snapped out of her thoughts and hurriedly said, "Ah, no...nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly lowered her head, afraid that the other party would detect that she was hiding something, after all, the person sitting in front of her was Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced at Camille and didn't say anything else, his gaze shifting to the rag on his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think Valda is doing now?" muttered the coarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille was startled and stared at Brian with wide eyes. "What...what is she doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe she's injured and still recovering, so she can't come back yet," Brian continued. "Or maybe she suddenly got inspired and is drawing her favorite comics, forgetting about time. When she finishes drawing the story she wants to tell, she'll naturally come back..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But when will she come back? Camille wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She breathed a sigh of relief. So that's what he was talking about. She thought Brian had noticed something else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It won't be long before Valda comes back," Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, she'll be back soon!" he said, as if this belief had become his only reason to keep going.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If one day this belief were to collapse, could he still go on living?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After loving someone so deeply, losing that person made the whole world lose its meaning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If only he had realized it earlier, how good would that have been? If only he had told her how much he loved her earlier, how good would that have been?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The phrase "I love you" has now become an unforgettable regret in my heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um..." Camille pursed her lips and hesitated a bit before saying, "Brian, if Valda were to come back in the future, but she's not quite the same as before, what would you do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's different? What do you mean by 'different'?" Brian asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's like having an incurable disease, for example, it's better to... be disabled, or have some physical problems," Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked up and stared at the other person. "Why do you say that?"</p></div>
