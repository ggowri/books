        <h1>Chapter 901</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips rested on her hands that were getting warmer as he spoke. "Don't you want to be my Sis? You wanted to be my Sis when you were drunk. If you want, we can go back to how it used to be, or even if you don't want to move back to Reed Residence, I can live with you in this rental house as I did before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stunned, Grace instantly raised her head and looked at him in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin sexy lips were pressed against her palm while his light, warm breath sprayed on her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face looked handsome with those delicate features, and his eyes were beautiful. It was as if he had fused the two opposites&mdash;purity and amorosity&mdash;to such an extreme that you could not take your eyes off his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do I want to be his Sis? Do I want to go back to the way it was?' Grace asked herself. 'Perhaps... that was the warmest and uninhibited time for me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Back then, I felt like I had a family and would no longer feel lonely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I never expected love. I just wanted family affection.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A moment later, the surprise in her eyes gradually subsided and she became calm as well as indifferent again. "Jason, we&rsquo;ve broken up, so there&rsquo;s no way we can go back to the way it used to be. You don't have to insist on me being your sister. If you want to experience what it feels like to be a brother, I'm sure there are plenty of women out there who would love to be your sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes turned cold, and his fingers clenched her hand hard. Grace immediately felt a pain in her wrist!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does that mean you'd rather stay with someone like Chase Harper than me?" he asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Keep him out of this," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you worried about him? Didn't you say you don't like him? Even if we&rsquo;ve broken up, why did you choose a man like him? What's so good about him?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She repeatedly defended Chase Harper, and that upset him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'At least... Chase Harper's sincere. At least Chase Harper respects me! If I date a man like Chase Harper, maybe I wouldn't have to worry about being dumped randomly,' Grace thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... I can't tell him these. Otherwise, Chase Harper's dead meat if Jason loses his temper.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think much of him. I only came into contact with him because of work!" she said lightly, trying to distance herself from Chase Harper. "What kind of man do you think I should choose after breaking up with you? Someone like Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression changed immediately, and the fingers that held her wrist almost seemed to break it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car arrived at the neighborhood Grace lived in, Grace got out of the car and walked almost at a brisk pace toward her house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if a sharp glare was staring at her throughout the entire time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath once she walked into the rental house and sat on the chair with her legs feeling a little weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a red mark on her wrist. Back in the car, he had only loosened his fingers when she cried out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he lowered his head and kissed the red mark on her wrist. "Don't make me mad, alright? I&rsquo;m afraid I might hurt you if I get mad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gentle mutters were so sweet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had been the one who hurt her the most! She wanted to stay far away from him and forget him in peace, but he kept disturbing her!</p></div>
