        <h1>Chapter 4084</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, I'm not some upright gentleman, so don't trust me too much!" Chandler said. "After dinner, I'll take you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'll take you home. We're not married yet, so it's better to keep a certain distance on some things!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> His tone was like drawing a line between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And he wouldn't allow her to easily cross that line!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the following days, Tina noticed that Chandler was noticeably distancing himself from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although their interactions were still similar to before, sometimes he would deliberately avoid her gaze, and when she wanted to hug or kiss him, he would find excuses to avoid it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> What's going on?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Does he not have any interest in her anymore? Does he not like her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was full of questions, but when she asked Chandler directly, he just said calmly, "You're overthinking it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is she really overthinking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As time passed by, Chandler's return to Hunter was approaching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hunter's family, for Tina, was like a mysterious entity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just when Tina was worried about Chandler suddenly distancing himself from her, she met Weldon again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Coincidentally, Weldon was filming at Tina's school that day, and they naturally started chatting after meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Tina thought of Weldon's connection to the Hunter family, and curiously asked, "Have you been to Hunter's family estate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Estate?" Weldon glanced at Tina, "Why are you suddenly asking this? Haven't you been there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, not yet," Tina admitted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weldon suddenly laughed, "Haha...haha, you, as Chandler's fianc&eacute;e, haven't been to the estate yet, haha..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked at Weldon, who was laughing exaggeratedly, come on, she hasn't been there, is it necessary to laugh like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it that funny?" she asked unkindly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not really funny, but it's in line with Hunter's usual style," Weldon said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Usual style?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Conservative and...cowardly!" Weldon evaluated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina frowned. She had heard the conservative evaluation before, but cowardly...it just doesn't make sense to describe Hunter with that word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Weldon seemed to have read her mind and said, "Families like the Hunters are actually quite cowardly, especially Chandler."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Chandler is not a coward!" Tina retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If he's not worried, then why hasn't he taken you to the family's place yet?" Weldon asked. "Have you ever thought about why he won't take you there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina fell silent. Of course, she had thought about it, but she couldn't come up with an answer. In the end, she could only blame it on Hunter's traditions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If you really want to understand Chandler, then go to the family's place. Maybe everything will become clear," Weldon said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This statement was like the temptation of a devil, and Tina's heart skipped a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Could she really understand Chandler?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler had said before that what she saw of him was not the real him, and maybe her thoughts would be different once she understood the real him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But what was the real Chandler like?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Would she be different after going to the family's place?</p></div>
