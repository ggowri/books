        <h1>Chapter 3796</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the weekend, Veronica called Mason again, but as she suspected, the call didn't go through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that he had blocked her number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only call Jasper again, "Jasper, do you know where Mason is now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason went to the school to handle his withdrawal procedures today," Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was surprised, "He's dropping out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he came to Stanford University as an exchange student. Now he's dropping out and going abroad to continue his studies," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt her hand shaking as she held the phone, "He's going abroad again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's okay, Mason has made an appointment with his parents to leave in two months," Jasper said. "Sister Veronica, did you and Mason really break up? Is there no chance to save it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica tightly pursed her lips and after a while said, "Yes, we broke up, but...I will try to save it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she still loved Mason, and she didn't believe that his feelings for her could disappear so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does he mean by "tired"? She already explained the misunderstanding, but he still insists on breaking up. What is the real reason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wants to figure it all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great, Sister Veronica, I believe you can do it. Mason can't not love you. Breaking up with you was just a momentary impulse!" Jasper said. She didn't want Mason to go abroad again. She asked Mason, and if he did, he didn't plan to come back for at least two years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hoped that the family could meet frequently, rather than having someone absent every time they had a meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to Stanford University to find him now," Veronica said, and quickly ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the bus to Stanford University, Veronica looked at the pendant on her phone. She had only bought this cat paw couple pendant not long ago, but the relationship between her and him seemed to be undergoing earth-shattering changes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, this couple pendant still hung on her phone, and to her, it seemed more like a mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't want to take off this pendant no matter what, because as long as it was still hanging on her phone, it was as if she and Mason had not broken up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Stanford University, Veronica received a call from Jasper. Jasper helped her inquire </span><span>about Mason's current location and said that he went to the library after talking with the school leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not a student at Stanford University, so she could only ask others along the way to find the location of the library.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Entering the library, she searched for a familiar figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanford University's library was already very large, and with so many students, there were many people in the library. It was not easy to find one person among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However... Veronica found that it was easier to find Mason than she had imagined, because even if he was sandwiched in a group of people, she could still see him at a glance.</span></p></div>
