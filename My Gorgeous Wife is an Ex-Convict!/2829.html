        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled. "Yes, you can."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His assurance immediately dispelled her tension. A smile spread from the corners of her lips. He fell into a trance when he saw her smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He found the smile beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got out of the car, waved at him, and turned to walk into the apartment, he slowly raised his fingers and touched his lips where she had just kissed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His usually cool lips were burning slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You checked into a hotel room with Brian!" Camille Strickland looked at her best friend. Things had escalated a little too quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. We only checked into a hotel to dry our wet clothes," Valda Theller hastened to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But didn't you spend the night at the hotel? Do you know how worried I was? I couldn't get through to you. I almost went to the police!" joked Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller touched her nose awkwardly. She found many missed calls and text messages from her best friend after charging her phone as soon as she got home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Didn't I call you back as soon as I charged my phone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, yeah, but I wouldn't have been so worried if I had known you were with Brian yesterday," said Camille Strickland as she looked curiously at her best friend. &ldquo;Well... Did anything happen between you and Brian yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face turned red as soon as she asked this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No way. Did something happen? What did he do to you? Don't they say men tend to give in to their sexual impulses? He didn't..." Camille Strickland said nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was speechless. Brian had not done anything to her. She was the one who did something to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not what you think!" she said, looking awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland saw her best friend's expression and probed, "Did you do something to him?" Come to think of it, it was not impossible. After all, Brian's looks and figure were top-notch among men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller covered her flushed face with both hands. Camille Strickland instantly knew she was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland patted her best friend on the shoulder. "It's normal. I get it. I get it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Valda Theller was flabbergasted. 'Is that any consolation?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland asked, "Did you proceed until the last step? If you did, did you use any contraception? If you get pregnant, it's always the woman who gets hurt if the father doesn't want the child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, we didn't! We only shared the same bed yesterday," she explained quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good. But don't forget to use contraception if anything happens," warned Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," mumbled Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Pregnant... Will I be pregnant with Brian's child one day? If so, will it mean that Brian has fallen in love with me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, the film crew called yesterday about Starlight Charity Gala. You&rsquo;re invited. An invitation will be sent to your studio in a couple of days." Camille Strickland finally mentioned what she wanted to say when she called yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm invited?" Valda Theller froze slightly. She learned from the news that Starlight Charity Gala had invited many popular celebrities, producers, directors, and socialites from Emerald City.</p></div>
