        <h1>Chapter 1376</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially... when he met Hadwin Stephenson today, he was obviously trying to hide his emotions and thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he lost it when he heard about Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But he and that Katherine Jackson..." Grace said hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There must be a reason for that. Sometimes, you can't have things both ways. You naturally have to make a choice," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "Do you mean Hadwin Stephenson chose Katherine Jackson because he wanted to get the Stephenson family back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just one of the possibilities," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. 'Is Hadwin Stephenson really like that? What is he going to tell Lina?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason held Grace's hand tightly as if to soothe her anxiety and tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the ward, Lina and Hadwin Stephenson were looking at each other. The person in front of her was so close, but she somehow felt that he was very far away... Very far away...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The distance between them now was even further than it had ever been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it... true... what's on the news?" she stammered. It had been some time since she woke up from her coma, but she only managed to speak in the last few days. She was still not too fluent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was silent. After a long time, he replied, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina trembled. "Are you... dating... another woman?" She tried to open her eyes wide as she asked. It was as though she wanted to see him better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson slowly walked to Lina's bedside. He bent his knees and knelt, slightly raising his chin. Now, he was looking up at her while she was looking down at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, I'm not a good person. I thought it would be easy to be with you, but you're not the right one for me after all." His voice was gentle like a lover's mutter but each word seemed so cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know I&rsquo;ve always been the Stephenson family's b*stard and looked down upon, so I've sworn to trample all those who despised me one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I did like you, but you're not helpful to my career and will even become my burden. However, Manlin can use the Jackson family's influence to help me realize my wish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he raised his hand as if to touch her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just as his hand was about to touch her face, he stopped. He withdrew his hand as though he feared he would be more reluctant to give up on Lina if he touched her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes moved. "Do you... mean it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I mean it. Lina, I really loved you when I loved you, but you can't give me what I really want, so you're not the right one for me. What I need is a woman who can help me," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina slowly lowered her eyes as if thinking about something, while Hadwin Stephenson continued to kneel in front of her as if waiting for something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both of them were like statues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, Lina's somewhat dry lips moved and she murmured, "Hadwin Stephenson... It turns out... your love&hellip; Your love for me only amounts to this.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's pupils suddenly constricted, and his face instantly turned pale. His hands that hung beside his body were clenched into fists as if he was trying hard to suppress something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina smiled gently, but her smile was so bitter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never felt so much pain even when she was between life and death, but she was in excruciating pain now!</p></div>
