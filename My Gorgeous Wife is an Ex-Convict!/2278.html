        <h1>Chapter 2276</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was a pang of self-reproach in her dark eyes even as she said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her pain seemed to influence her as she suddenly hugged him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The abruptness of her gesture even surprised her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were before, she would probably never think of hugging Martin Weiss again one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was really hugging him right now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it guilt? Am I just feeling sorry? Or... is it something else?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, enough is enough... You don't have anything to blame yourself for, alright? I was even glad that the blood existed when it was transfused back to yourself. If they hadn&rsquo;t done that and if something had happened to you, then I..." Her voice broke. She was almost unable to go on. "Fortunately, you got off the operating table safely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was stunned. All he could smell was her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was hugging him... How long had she not hugged him of her own volition?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed to be a long time ago when she loved him and would always hug him voluntarily. She would ask him coquettishly to love her more and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she said back then was... "It isn't enough. I want you to love me more. Martin, I'm a greedy woman. If you can't give me a lot of love, I will never find it enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she was saying, &lsquo;Enough. That's enough!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss closed his eyes and opened his arms to gently hug the person in front of him. He was afraid that this hug was just his imagination and that it never existed at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened slightly, but she did not push Martin Weiss away. Instead, she continued to say gently, "You've done a lot for me. If I had fear and doubts for you before, then... they&rsquo;re all gone now. I know that you&rsquo;ll give your life to save us no matter what danger our children and I face!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she watched him lay on the operating table, all she wanted was for him to be safe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She also found out today that her heart ached for this man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Martin Weiss's hoarse voice muttered, "Aren't you afraid of me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, not anymore," she muttered. All she was afraid of was that he might get even more seriously injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla... Kyla..." he kept mumbling as he buried his face in her chest. His voice was breaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though every word he said now hurt his wounds, he could not help uttering her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the name that had been on his mind for so long...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla found herself lying in Martin Weiss's hospital bed when she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's ward was a VIP ward, and the bed inside was larger than an ordinary hospital bed. There was still room even if two people lay on it. However, it was still... awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was more awkward was that she opened her eyes to meet Martin Weiss's.</p></div>
