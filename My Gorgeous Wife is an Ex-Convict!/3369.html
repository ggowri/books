        <h1>Chapter 3367</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina's older brother is famous throughout the class! Many girls in the class like him because he is even more handsome than a movie star!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If only she had a big brother like this too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would definitely become the envy of all the girls in the class... no, the whole school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, she has a brother, but he doesn't look as good as she does!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Last time she was thinking of giving Tina something for Sleeping Cat, and asked Tina to give her this big brother's email address. But Tina accepted everyone's Sleeping Cat except hers! She was really angry about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If big brother likes it, then I can give this set of stamps to Tina!" Laura smiled at Chandler, hoping to appear cute and obedient in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler seemed uninterested after just glancing at Laura Mond, saying "Let? Why do you need to let Tina have what she wants?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just a simple sentence, and Laura's expression froze instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wrap it up," Chandler said to the nearby staff member.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff was about to respond, but Laura interrupted loudly, "Since you don't want to give it to me, then I'll buy this set of seals. No matter how many sets there are, I want them all! Lonny, help me buy them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, the butler of the Mond family is accompanying Laura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Lonny stepped forward and said to the staff, "My miss wants all the sets of this stamp that are left in the venue."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff looked hesitant and said, "There is only one set of this stamp, and it's a limited edition. Many people have bought it, and it's unlikely that we can get more from other places."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, it's sold out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Laura became even more determined to get this stamp, and Tina was also nervous, afraid that someone else might take it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If someone else took it, it would be fine, but they couldn't let Laura take it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Tina's opinion, Laura always tries to cause trouble. Once during an exam, Tina kindly showed her the answer, but because she used a different method from the teacher for that question, although the answer was correct, it was different from the other students' methods.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only she and Laura had different answers on their exam papers, so the teacher asked them about it. However, before Tina could say anything, Laura accused her of copying her answers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That incident caused a rift between Tina and Laura!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, later on, Tina explained her thought process to the teacher, and Laura couldn't explain hers, so the truth was revealed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But since then, Tina never looked at Laura kindly again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take this set of seals for my young lady," Lonny said to the staff. "My young lady's father is in charge of Mond Group and is an old friend of Vice President Gary from your company. We've already discussed this set of seals with Vice President Gary before and asked him to help us reserve it."</p></div>
