        <h1>Chapter 248</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director was momentarily dumbstruck, not knowing what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's voice was not soft, so many people heard it. All eyes immediately turned to Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she knew it, Evelyn was startled when she heard Jason saying, "Since this person doesn't think it's up to standard, let her demonstrate for us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said as he cast a casual glance at Evelyn as if the matter was now settled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn almost wanted to scream. What did that mean? Was she supposed to kneel and grovel? She was the second female lead! She was also Brian's girlfriend. How could she kneel and grovel in public when it was an extra&rsquo;s job?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was clearly standing up for Grace and trying to find fault with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn froze with a pale face. The director looked at Jason before once again looking at Evelyn. He considered for a while, then quickly walked up to Evelyn and squeezed a smile. He said, "Evelyn, since it was you who said the extras' were not up to standard last time, why don't you show the extras what&rsquo;s expected of them? Think of it as a demonstration for the extras. It's also kind to help the extras, is it not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn choked with resentment. "It's not my part. Why should I demonstrate it? "</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director lowered his voice and said, "Evelyn, I'm not trying to give you a hard time. It's Young Master Reed who wants you to demonstrate. If you really don't want to demonstrate, that's fine. Why don't you just go talk to Young Master Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the director said this, Evelyn's face changed again. She did not have the courage to talk to Jason. The thought of Jason looking at her made her shudder again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Through gritted teeth, Evelyn barely squeezed the three words out of her mouth. "Alright, I'll demonstrate!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After exchanging a few pleasantries, he made Evelyn demonstrate in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's face looked mortified. She could now clearly see that the cast and the crew looking at her with sympathy. Behind their sympathy, there was also mockery and amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had only been a small-time actress before this. All of a sudden, she became the girlfriend of the entertainment industry's crown prince and made many people were jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now she was in such bad luck that people were glad to see it happen to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Evelyn began to kneel and grovel in front of the entire crew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had never practiced this before. Some of the basic gestures, which she made according to the impression she had seen earlier, were not up to standard at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another thing was that her mind was in such a mess that she wanted to get the demonstration done as soon as possible, not caring whether or not it was up to standard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finally finishing the kneeling and groveling, Evelyn got up and thought that the matter was over with. However, Jason's voice rang again, "She looked as if she was kneeling and groveling to the air, which affected her performance. Her movements felt jerky. Why don't we find someone to stand in front of her so that she can properly kneel and grovel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said and went up to Grace. He pulled Grace into the crowd, looking lazily at Evelyn while saying, "Why don't you demonstrate one more time?"</p></div>
