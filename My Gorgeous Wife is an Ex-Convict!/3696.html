        <h1>Chapter 3694</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would she turn against him and even want to break free from their engagement and leave him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?" Tina asked strangely, raising her hand and waving it in front of Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly grabbed her hand and held it in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, I... hope you can love me in the future, but I don't like it because you 'have' to love me," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was his greed, hoping that she didn't love him just because of their engagement or his family's favor to hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina seemed a bit confused. "So...what should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand and touched her forehead. "In a few years, maybe you'll understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few years later... Tina felt a bit regretful. She wasn't as clueless about love as he imagined. After all, she had read so many comics, novels, and watched so many movies and TV shows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has she never seen a pig walking just because she hasn't eaten pork?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, there were classmates in her class who were in relationships. When the girls got together, they would talk about these things too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually wanted to date Chandler too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know when she could fulfill this wish, instead of being treated like a child by Chandler, who kept saying they had an engagement and hoped she would love him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlow, later you'll let Angelica choose which of these dresses to wear for tonight's ceremony." The manager of the agency said to Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Veronica responded and pushed the hanger with the dresses into Angelica's dressing room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The makeup artist was doing Angelica's makeup. Veronica said, "Miss Kinsman, these are your dresses for tonight. Which one do you want to wear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica stood up and walked to Veronica, but instead of looking at the dresses, she stared at Veronica and asked, "Don't you know the Reed family? Why are you still working as a little assistant here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I work as an assistant here or not, and whether I know those people or not, are not related." Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you know those people, it's not difficult to find a better job, is it?" Angelica looked at Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just know them, but they don't have any obligation to help me," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So... what's your relationship with Mason?" Angelica asked with a meaningful look in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's eyelashes trembled and her gaze gently lowered. "We don't have much of a relationship, just... acquaintances."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that really all?" Angelica asked with some dissatisfaction. "Didn't Mason protect you from the pasta I threw at you that day? If you don't want to tell the truth, you don't have to lie like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It really is just like that. Miss Kinsman, if you ask him, I believe he will give you the same answer," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica looked at Veronica suspiciously and suddenly said, "I heard from other assistants that you took a very expensive suit to the dry cleaners, and that suit wouldn't happen to be the one Mason took off that day, would it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It... was that one," Veronica's body stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you get the clothes back from the dry cleaners, give them to me and I'll return the suit to Mason," Angelica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was stunned and looked at Angelica in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Don't want to?" Angelica raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not that," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fine then," Angelica quickly interrupted Veronica. "Since I dirtied Mason's clothes last time, I'll apologize to him when I return the suit."</span></p></div>
