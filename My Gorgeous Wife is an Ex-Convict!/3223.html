        <h1>Chapter 3221</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When we arrived at the venue of the comic convention, there were already a lot of people there. However, most of the attendees were young people, and there weren't many people over the age of 30.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, many young people are dressed in trendy and even exaggerated clothing, some even wearing heavy makeup, resembling characters from a comic book.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Squeezed among this group of anime enthusiasts, Valda feels a sense of her own lost youth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them were strolling along when suddenly Valda's eyes lit up at a large display booth, and she found herself unable to move her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Among these prizes, the third prize is a set of rare comics," Valda said. "I used to really like these comics and would read them at the library. They're no longer available for purchase, so it's surprising to see them here, but unfortunately they're only being offered as a prize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it's for sale, she would like to buy it and keep it as a collection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although this type of comic book may not be worth much even if it goes out of print, it is still a keepsake at the very least.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This comic series can be considered as her initiation into drawing shoujo manga. Back then, when she first encountered this type of manga, she was deeply shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I never knew that love stories could be expressed in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, she fell in love with drawing comics, which was actually related to the comics she used to read.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So I'll talk to the organizers and suggest replacing the third prize with something else, and then buy this set of comics," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't do that, it's not good. Maybe there are many people, like me, who actually like this third prize and are working hard to win it!" said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the table, there were already several people who were preparing to participate in the competition and clearly aiming to win the prize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The host is still keeping the atmosphere lively and inviting the audience on site to continue signing up enthusiastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's go win this prize," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was stunned when she saw Brian raise his hand to apply for the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian is already tall, making him stand out in a crowd. So when he raised his hand, the host immediately noticed him and invited him on stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda stared blankly as Brian went up on stage, only to belatedly come to her senses and realize that he was really going to compete for a prize?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This action seems to have nothing to do with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's appearance on stage immediately drew gasps of amazement from the group of girls below. After all, the other contestants were all young people, and Brian clearly had an age difference with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this age difference gives him a mature charm, especially with the slight sense of detachment he carries, which adds to his mysterious aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's so handsome!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this guy also an anime fan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could he be a model?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girls in the audience were already discussing, and some were taking out their phones to take pictures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Brian on stage, knowing that he was doing something he wouldn't have done before for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, the number of contestants reached its limit, and the host began to ask each contestant their name, purpose of participation, whether they like anime, and their favorite anime character, etc.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When it was finally Brian's turn, he simply stated his last name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Mr. Hart, what is your purpose for participating?" the host asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My wife really wants the set of manga books for third prize, so I joined this competition," Brian said.</p></div>
