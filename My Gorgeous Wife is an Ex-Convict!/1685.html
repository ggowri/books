        <h1>Chapter 1683</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The weather was hotter now, so most people wore low-cut clothing. However, Grace wore a turtleneck, covering herself up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, don't you feel hot?" asked Jasper as she batted her almond-shaped eyes that were similar to Grace's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No," Grace replied awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After her and Jason&rsquo;s intimate time together yesterday afternoon, she almost could not get up from bed, let alone pick up the kids. She also had red marks all over her body. If her neck and neckline were visible, everyone would know what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Fortunately, Jasper did not ask any more questions but turned her head and began to whisper to Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace noticed that the two siblings often whispered to each other this week as if they had a secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she did not think much of it. After all, the brother and sister having a secret meant that they were close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" Jason's voice rang in Grace's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She turned her head, her lips almost touching his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I don't feel hot!" Grace said with some embarrassment. They were so close that she could see each of his eyelashes. The way she looked in his eyes, and... their synced breathing made her feel as though they were in their own world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" he asked with a slight smile on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She cleared her throat. "Next time, don't... leave hickeys... in such obvious places. People will easily see them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He raised his hand slightly to touch her neck. "Are you embarrassed? We're married, so what if someone sees it? It just means we have a great relationship, doesn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had deliberately left the hickeys. It was as if imprinting his mark on her so others would not covet her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace froze, suddenly finding herself unable to contradict him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you're embarrassed, then you can leave a mark on my neck next time," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"..." If he showed it in public, then she would be just as embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Some people looked their way. After all, a handsome man was holding an elegant woman in his arms. They stood so close that the tips of their noses almost touched. This scene of the couple looked just like a pleasing picture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, the melodious voice of a child rang out. "Daddy, Mommy, there seems to be someone playing the piano over there. Shall we go and have a look?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace came to her senses and quickly agreed to her daughter's request. "Okay." Then, she took her son and daughter to the spot her daughter mentioned with a blushing face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason smiled and followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When they came to where the music was being played, they realized that a child was playing the piano. The child looked to be almost five or six years old. He was a handsome boy wearing a regular white shirt and pants. He looked refreshing and smart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy played the piano deftly with all ten fingers. Beautiful music flowed from his fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, there were no changes in the boy's expression. Even though he was playing a happy tune, he was not smiling. It was as if he was just playing mechanically.</p></div>
