        <h1>Chapter 1164</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good to hear," said Lina as she took out the toy she had specially bought today to amuse the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thanks, Aunt Sweeney," said the little one. He seemed to like the toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Lina's phone suddenly rang. She answered it, and it was a call from the hospital&rsquo;s security guard. "Hello, are you the owner of XXX? Your car is parked in City First Hospital's parking lot, but the alarm keeps going off. Please come and deal with it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah. Okay, I'll be right there!" said Lina. She said to Grace, "Grace, I'm going downstairs for a while. There seems to be something wrong with my car's alarm system."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Grace. Once Lina got out of the room, another nurse came and asked Kyla Corbyn to go see the doctor. As such, there was only Grace at the bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Kyla Corbyn walked out of the ward, Nelson suddenly lowered his head and stopped playing with the new toy in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you stop playing?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aunt, am I... a bad boy?" Nelson asked dully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What makes you think that?" Grace asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I got into a fight, and the hospital bill costs a lot of money. Mommy has to work really hard now to make money," he said guiltily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace touched the little one's head. Nelson had always been more mature and sensible than other children his age, but due to him being deaf since childhood, he was also more reserved than other children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he was also lively like other children sometimes, he was quiet and shy most of the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Grace more or less knew the reason why Nelson had fought with his classmates when she came to the hospital yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said gently, "You fought for your mommy, didn't you? You did it to stop others from saying bad things about her and to protect your mommy. It's a good thing. It means you're a sentimental kid, and you have someone you want to protect!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one blinked his eyes and looked at Grace with some surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace continued saying, "But we shouldn't do things on impulse. We need to weigh our options and consider what we should do. For example, you'll get hurt and get hospitalized if you fight, and it'll make your mommy and grandmother sad, so next time, can you figure out a better way to solve the problem while protecting the people who are important to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's a better way?" asked the little one in his childlike voice. He only half-understood Grace&rsquo;s words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no idea what was a better way either. "Nelson, you can think about it, and I'll think about it with you, okay? But remember, no matter what happens, what you should do is to protect yourself because your loved ones will worry the most when you're hurt!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one gave a hard nod at that. "I'll protect Mommy! I'll protect Grandma, you, and Aunt Sweeney!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Nelson's manly indeed," Grace praised with a soft smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Lina returned to the ward and Grace asked, "Is the car okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's okay, but I'll go to a repair shop later to have it checked. The alarm system has been going off two or three times recently for no reason at all," said Lina.</p></div>
