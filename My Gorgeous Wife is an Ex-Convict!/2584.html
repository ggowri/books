        <h1>Chapter 2582</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she signed the divorce papers, she would have nothing to do with Martin Weiss anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They would no longer be husband and wife. Even if they have two children together, they probably would not see much of each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt nothing but an intense tightness in her chest at the thought of it. It was as if something was stirring in her chest, making it throb with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a car suddenly pulled up beside her. Grace anxiously ran out of it. "Did you sign the divorce papers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace?" Kyla froze and looked at her in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you signed the divorce papers?" Grace urgently asked. She was afraid that she was too late. If Kyla had signed them, she could only intercept the lawyers at the firm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "Not yet. But how did you know I came here to sign the divorce papers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I went to your house to look for you, but Aunt told me you came to this law firm to sign the divorce papers, so I hurriedly came over. Fortunately, you haven't signed them yet," Grace said as she let out a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's nothing fortunate about it. I should&rsquo;ve signed the divorce papers. It's just that... I'm afraid something's missing from the agreement, so I want to think it over," Kyla made an excuse and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're reluctant." Grace went to the point and said, making Kyla's excuse seem weak instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla turned pale slightly. She did not know how to refute her for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I have something to say to you. Let's find a place to talk. Get in the car first," Grace said as she opened the car door and signaled for Kyla to get on board.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, if you're still trying to talk me out of the divorce, don't. Martin Weiss and I were destined for divorce from the beginning," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I hope we can find a place to talk no matter what. I won't stand in your way if you still decide to divorce him afterward. I only want you to make a decision that you won't regret," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla sighed before finally getting into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got in the driver's seat and drove. She turned the steering wheel and drove the other way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace's car pulled into a hospital parking lot, Kyla froze. It was the hospital where she gave birth. "Why did you bring me here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because there are things I wish to have you see and words I wish for you to hear. Kyla, come with me. If you don't want to be kept in the dark about some things, come with me," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Grace led the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Grace's back hesitantly. She seemed to have a premonition that whatever Grace wanted to tell her was something shocking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it about Martin Weiss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If so, what do I not know?'</p></div>
