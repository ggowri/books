        <h1>Chapter 1009</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, Brian said he&rsquo;s in love with you the other day at the police station. What about you? What do you think of him? It seems that Mr. Jason also cares about you. Did you and Mr. Reed... really break up?" Stella probed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace merely looked at her and did not reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella put on a sad expression. "Grace, you know I'm not well educated, and I was with the wrong man. Brian is now the only one I can rely on, and... After spending time with him these days, I really like Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she put on another blushing expression. "You still have Jason, but I only have Brian left. You're not going to take Brian from me, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at Stella until the latter felt guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, why are you looking at me like that? I... I know I've said some things that have upset you in the past, but now I'm telling you this with all my heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you expect me to say that I don't love Brian and I don't have any ideas about him so that you can feel at ease? Did you think you could at least take the moral high ground so that if I like Brian someday, you would then try to stop me with the response you&rsquo;re hoping to receive from me at this moment?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expression on Stella's face showed that this was clearly the idea she had in mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Sis, don't you find it funny? You're asking someone else to make a promise for your relationship. For Grandma's sake, let me remind you again that Brian isn't easy to fool. It might not be too late if you get out of it now. The more you get, the more you'll..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If a man like Brian knew he had been lied to, a miserable fate would await Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean?" Stella's expression changed immediately. "Are you threatening me? I'll be fine with Brian as long as you keep your mouth shut."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her cousin, Grace knew it would only be a waste of effort no matter how much she said. "Do as you please. I'll leave it at that, and you don't have to come to me about Brian again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Grace turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella stood there with a gleam of pride in her eyes. She slowly pulled a recorder pen out of her pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The content she wanted had been recorded anyway. She just had to find a professional to edit it and she could get the effect she wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The black Bentley was parked in the shadows, and the car was quiet. Jason was sitting in the car, looking through the window at the building's entrance not far away. He appeared to be thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence did not even dare make a noise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some time, a thin figure caught Terrence's sight. Terrence was immediately delighted. 'Grace's finally back, and... The most important thing is that she came back alone!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence had been worried that a man might accompany Grace back. If it really was the case, it would put Master Reed in a bad mood again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to his surprise, Master Reed did not get out of the car and remained seated. Even until Grace's figure walked into the building, he still did not see any movement from his boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed, Miss Cummins has entered..." Terrence said, thinking Jason did not see Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason did not seem to hear him. He just continued staring out of the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Master Reed see Grace just now?' Terrence thought to himself. However, he did not understand why Master Reed did not get out of the car if he saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed had been waiting for more than an hour today, all for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After more than an hour, Jason finally ordered, "Go back to Reed Residence."</p></div>
