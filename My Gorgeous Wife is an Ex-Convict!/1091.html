        <h1>Chapter 1090</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that he was sleeping, he looked like a man who had lost his edge. He was no longer overwhelming, but rather, he looked like a beautiful angel one could not help approaching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the frown on his brows made him look somewhat vulnerable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Vulnerable?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed and was about to pull herself out of his arms when his hand seemed to grab her unconsciously. Then... he caught four fingers of her right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was startled and tried to pull her fingers out of his hand, but instead, she made him hold on tighter! It was as if he was clinging to his treasure and could not let it go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless. She still could not leave after all her efforts. 'Do I have to sleep in this bed with him tonight?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried several more times, but she could not withdraw her hand from his. In the end, she wondered if he was actually asleep or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his eyes never opened, nor did he do anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she could only comfort herself that they had slept together in one bed before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment's hesitation, Grace pulled the covers over themselves. Then, she put as much distance between them as she could and leaned against one corner of the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought it would be difficult for her to fall asleep in the same bed with Jason, but she fell asleep quickly and slept through the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took her a while to get used to the harsh sunlight when she opened her bleary eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What time is it? Where am I&hellip;' In a daze, Grace looked at the unfamiliar ceiling and habitually tried to raise her hand to rub her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her body stiffened. She felt another hand pulling the fingers of her right hand. Then, she turned her head and caught sight of Jason's face. The memories of the previous night flooded into her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I... slept here the entire night!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat up slowly, feeling that her right hand had gone numb in Jason's grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, he was not holding it as tightly as he had yesterday. She pulled it out of his fingers with a little force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, a murmur escaped from his mouth as though he had sensed something. However, instead of opening his eyes, he remained asleep with them closed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately got up to leave. However, she was stunned when she saw an abnormal flush on Jason's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was&hellip; red&mdash;an unusual red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to be... burning too when he held her hand just now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because he&rsquo;s a heavy sleeper or&hellip;' She hesitated and raised her hand to his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A burning sensation filled her palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's so hot!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surprised. 'He's... having a fever and the temperature doesn&rsquo;t seem low!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not have a thermometer at hand, let alone fever-reducing medicine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason!" She called to him, trying to wake him up. "Are... Are you conscious? Wake up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes fluttered a little. After calling him a few times, he finally opened his eyes slowly and looked at her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "You&rsquo;re having a fever! Is there any fever-reducing medicine in this house? Or you can contact the outside world right now and have someone take you to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sat up slowly and asked as he looked at her, "Why won't you leave while you can?"</p></div>
