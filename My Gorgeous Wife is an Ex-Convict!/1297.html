        <h1>Chapter 1296</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s mother only gave birth to him to become a part of the Reed family as the mother of their heir. However, once she found out she could not do so, he became nothing more than an abandoned pawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman in front of him was willing to sacrifice anything she could for her children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Children were never pawns to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were always as clear as water. Even if she had suffered so much in prison, it had never polluted the clarity in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because of this that... he would love her so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly hugged Grace. "I won't let your hands become crippled. I won't allow it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would cure her hands even if he had to give up his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled gently, raised her hands, and hugged Jason back. She was calm about the situation with her hands. "Jay, you don't have to worry about it! Even if these hands go crippled, you'll be my hands, won't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gave a loud nasal reply, "Yes. I'll be your hands..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ll give you everything you want&mdash;no matter what it is!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had an expert check the prescription prescribed by Dr. Russell. They concluded that nothing was wrong with it and it was indeed suitable for pregnant women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Jason had someone fill the prescription. That night, the medicine was boiled into a decoction and put in a foot basin so Grace could soak her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason carefully applied the residue on the backs of Grace's hands first, especially the joints.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it hot?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. It's pretty comfortable," said Grace. The medicine residue was a little hot, but it warmed her hands, making her feel comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he knelt in front of her, took her feet, and soaked them in the foot basin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The foot basin was equipped with heat retention technology, so they did not have to worry about the decoction cooling down after some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The warm heat gradually spread to her entire body from the soles of her feet. The unique smell of traditional medicine wafted throughout the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly said, "Jay, can you come with me to my mom's if you're free this weekend? I want to tell her about our marriage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though her mother had passed away, she still wanted to go and tell her mother about the news. Her mother would be happy for her if God existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," murmured Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her feet were almost done soaking, he squatted again, took a clean towel to wipe her feet clean, and removed the residue from the back of her hands. Then, he carried her into the bathroom, washed her hands, and carried her out of the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You carry me around so much that it makes me feel as though I can't walk," Grace could not help saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter if you can't walk. I'll hold you forever," he said gently as he looked at her with tenderness in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart suddenly began to beat faster. She could not help sighing to herself. 'Gosh, does he know how alluring the look in his eyes is right now?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Being stared at like that, I can&rsquo;t help but want to... Uhh... Press him down hard!'</p></div>
