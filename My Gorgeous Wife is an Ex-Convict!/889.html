        <h1>Chapter 888</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back when she was still living with him, they had a similar conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, her answer was...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Of course, I like you!" Grace grinned. It was a drunken grin, but her answer was the same as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she behaving like when we were together because she's drunk? Back then, she was my Sis and I was her Jason.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you be my Sis if I'm good?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Be my Sis. Stay with me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even though I can&rsquo;t give you love, I can give you something else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I can fulfill your dreams and your ambitions for you. I can make those who despise you bow before you, and I can get you to the top of the social hierarchy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'As long as... you stay with me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe this was the only way to make him feel less guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, but... I&rsquo;ve always been your Sis. Jason, don't worry, I'll... protect you. I'll protect you..." she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, her eyelids began to droop, and her voice became lower and lower. Finally, she tilted her head and fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gently helped her to lie down. Then, he helped her with the thin quilt and raised his hand to stroke her messy hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really want to protect me, then stay with me. That way, I won't be hurt..." he murmured. The palm of his left hand was slowly pressed against his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that as long as he stopped loving her, she would not be able to control his emotions and he could control his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it turned out that... he could not bear her leaving his side!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to keep her by his side and look at her all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not love her, but... he wanted to see her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin looked at Lina who was in such a drunken state that he dismissed the idea of sending her back to her home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the very least, he should make her drink some soup for her hangover later and wait until she was sober enough before taking her home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, he would have to get rid of the vest she was clutching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin glanced at the vest with resentment as he thought of this. He had never seen her clutch his clothes that dearly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she was so enthusiastic about grabbing another man's clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin drove the car to his mansion and brought Lina in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make a bowl of soup for her hangover," Hadwin ordered the servant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," answered the servant. However, before leaving, her curious eyes caught a glimpse of Lina's reddened cheeks and the vest she was clutching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Young Master Stephenson doesn&rsquo;t look quite right. Could it be that Miss Sweeney has done something?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servant had been working there for more than a year. Young Master Stephenson had always put on a poker face and no one could see through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was only with Miss Sweeney that Young Master Stephenson seemed to break his composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyone could see through him at a glance now.</p></div>
