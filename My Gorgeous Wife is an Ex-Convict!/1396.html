        <h1>Chapter 1395</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, why do you believe in Paisley Daniels so much? Is it just because she donated her bone marrow to you and saved your life?" she asked abruptly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His brows suddenly furrowed. "How did you know about this?" Only the Weiss family and the Daniels family knew about this. They had never announced it to the public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you believe me if I said she wasn't the one who saved you?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He snapped impatiently, "Are you trying to slander Paisley again? Kyla Corbyn, do you want to go to prison again? I don't care how you found out about this, but I&rsquo;m warning you not to sow discord between Paisley and me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly grabbed her jaw as he spoke. His eyes and voice were cold. "If it wasn't Paisley who saved me, could it have been you then? I've sworn that I'll protect her, love her, and be loyal to her for as long as I live. You can forget about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn burst into laughter, which gradually grew louder and louder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop laughing!" he yelled. He only found her laughter exceptionally irritating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla Corbyn was still laughing, even to tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. Stop laughing!" He immediately reached out his hand, covered her mouth, and stifled all her laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to hear her laugh like that again. Her laughter was like a sharp steel thorn that pierced his eardrums and stung his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her lips were pressed against his palm, but there was a slight coolness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did he realize how cold her skin was against his palm and how pale her face was. It was as if it was bloodless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes met hers. Her eyes were indifferent and cold, and there were tears in the corners of her eyes. Those were the tears from her fit of laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt as though her gaze had struck him hard in the heart. It made his heart ache as though he was suffocating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he no longer occupied an important position in his eyes and she had kicked him out of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who does she hold in her heart, then? Nelson? Her mother? Or is it the 'Uncle Harper' Nelson mentioned who looks like an honest man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How far along is her relationship with that man? Has she slept with that guy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought that she would be as close with another man as she had been with him made him very irritable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, don't try any more tricks and don't think you can get away with it! If you don't want to make things hard for Nelson, apologize to Paisley and the Daniels family!" Martin Weiss suppressed the discomfort in his heart and said in a cold voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn slowly closed her eyes. It was as if she did not even want to look at the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was using their son to get her to apologize again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Last time, she had wanted to fulfill her son's wish, so she knelt in front of Paisley Daniels and apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... It turned out that others could take a step forward if you took a step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, he was using their son as a condition to get her to apologize once more.</p></div>
