        <h1>Chapter 2125</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina lay down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla asked her mother to look after the store while she got into Grace's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace drove while Kyla called Hadwin Stephenson. "Hadwin Stephenson? Lina's water broke. We're sending her to the hospital..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How is Lina doing?" Hadwin Stephenson asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She... She's pretty calm right now," said Kyla as she put the phone in front of Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the phone, Lina said while taking a deep breath, "Hadwin... The... The baby and I will be fine. Don't... Don't worry. Don't... Don't panic when you go to the hospital. Don't drive yourself. Have the driver drive..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not forget to warn him. She was afraid he might drive himself and get into an accident if he was distracted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I got it. Don't be scared. Don't be scared! You have me," said Hadwin Stephenson, but his trembling voice sounded more scared than Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once the call was over, Lina continued taking deep breaths to relax, while Kyla kept talking to distract her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace only wished she could reach the hospital immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, the hospital Lina had registered in was not far away from Kyla's store. 20 minutes later, they finally arrived safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson had already contacted the hospital, so as soon as their car arrived, doctors and nurses instantly carried Lina onto a stretcher and pushed her to the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla then finally found herself a little weak. "Lina... will deliver the baby safely, won't she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, Hadwin Stephenson must have made all the preparations in the hospital. She also has all those specialists tending to her. She'll be fine!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two waited outside the delivery room. Moments later, Hadwin Stephenson also hurried over. As soon as he saw Grace and Kyla, he immediately asked, "How is Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't know. The doctors are still checking on her," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, a nurse came out of the delivery room and said, "Is Lina's family here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes!" Hadwin Stephenson replied immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The mother's water broke too soon. Please come with me to handle the paperwork, and a family member can go in to accompany the mother..." the nurse said as she took Hadwin Stephenson to the registration place. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson put on sterile clothing and followed the nurse into the delivery room, while Grace and Kyla continued to wait outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, as time passed, the feeling of unease grew. It grew stronger when Grace saw several doctors hurrying into the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, do you think... something happened in there?" Kyla asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, everything should be fine. Lina's pregnancy check-ups before this had all been normal," said Grace, but she felt intensely uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When a nurse hurried out of the room, Grace immediately asked, "I'm Lina's friend. How is Lina doing right now? Has she... Has she delivered the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The mother's having a difficult labor." The nurse hurried away after saying this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Kyla both looked shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Difficult labor...'</p></div>
