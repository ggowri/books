        <h1>Chapter 1748</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, that sympathy had now become a sharp pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the car reached the apartment where the He family lived, Grace almost ran out of the car and headed for the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The He family lived in an old apartment with no elevator and only stairs. They lived on the fifth floor. When Grace ran to the fifth floor, she only heard shouting from one of the units.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kidnapping? Who would kidnap an orphan? What good would kidnapping the boy do? You didn't gang up with that brat to extort money from your father, did you? Let me tell you, that money is your father's and mine. It has nothing to do with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sound insulation in an old apartment like this was horrible. Grace could make out that the bitterly scornful voice was the voice of Rosalind Bush, Mason's adoptive mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I saw someone carry Mason into the car with my own eyes. Mason must have been kidnapped!" Veronica Barlow's worried voice rang out. "If you won't save Mason, I will! I'm gonna use the money my mom left me to save Mason! I know my mother left me a lot of money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Your mother? Your mother's long dead!" snapped Rosalind Bush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if my mother is dead, everything she left me is still here. This house is my mother's! I'll sell the house so I'll have the money to save Mason!" shouted Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're even thinking of selling the house? Have you lost your mind? Even if the brat was kidnapped, we don't have enough money to save him. He's not even related to us by blood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Says who? Mason is my brother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yetian's your brother. He's related to you by blood. Who the hell does that brat think he is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, there was the sound of a slap and the door opened. Veronica Barlow ran out of the house and was stunned at the sight of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Aunt... aunt Cummins!" muttered Veronica Barlow. One of her cheeks had a distinct red mark caused by the slap earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Rosalind Bush's voice came from behind. "Where are you going, brat? I'm telling you, it's no use even if you go to your mother's lawyer..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Rosalind Bush rushed over and tried to pull Veronica Barlow over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace raised her hand, smacked Rosalind Bush&rsquo;s hand away, and pulled Veronica Barlow behind her. "What are you going to do to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"She's my daughter, and what does an outsider like you have to do with what I'm going to do with her? F*ck off! I'm educating my daughter!" said Rosalind Bush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm not your daughter!" snapped Veronica Barlow. She only had one mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You brat!" Rosalind Bush wanted to beat Veronica Barlow up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace protected Veronica Barlow's thin body as she raised her hand to grab Rosalind Bush's hand. "Stop it! I won't let you go if you touch her again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You won't let me go? Who do you think you are? Let me tell you, as long as she has the surname He, I'll beat her up whenever I want!" snapped Rosalind Bush as she countered Grace and twisted her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's hand, which was injured, instantly hurt when Rosalind Bush did that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Rosalind Bush became more aggressive when she saw that and started waving her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace protected Veronica Barlow in her arms tightly. The child was Mason's only warmth in the He family. She was the one who had always desperately protected Mason, so she would protect this child no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
