        <h1>Chapter 2457</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there... something on my face?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, and you're not who I want to protect. It's the baby you're carrying," he said against his conviction. It was as if he did not want to admit that he would always be overwhelmed whenever he saw her pained look, especially when her belly was hurting. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he wished he could endure the pain on her behalf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's wrong with me?' Martin Weiss secretly asked himself. Was even hypnosis unable to erase his love because the love was too deep?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The atmosphere in the car suddenly became awkward. Fortunately, the doctor and nurse in the ambulance eased the atmosphere by asking Kyla if she had any discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car arrived in Emerald City, Kyla was taken to Municipal Women's Hospital for a series of tests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the test reports came out, the specialists were already waiting for the consultation session.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not know that Martin Weiss would also be attending the consultation with the specialists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was wheeled back to the ward by the nurse, she saw her mother and Nelson, whom she had not seen for days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn's eyes reddened at the sight of the state her daughter was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, don't worry. There are so many specialists working together to treat me. It&rsquo;ll be okay," said Kyla as she comforted her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not sure either. She had no idea whether she could survive this, but she did not want her mother to be upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, are you sure you're going to be okay?" Nelson Corbyn's little face was grave. His eyes which were similar to hers were full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her son, Kyla only felt that Nelson was becoming increasingly like Martin Weiss apart from his eyes, which were similar to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled and said, "I&rsquo;ll be alright for you and Grandma. When your sibling is born, will you help me take good care of them, Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn nodded his little head sternly. "I'll take good care of my sibling."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled with relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Mrs. Corbyn had left with Nelson Corbyn. Kyla fell asleep on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The single-room VIP ward was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, someone pushed the door open and walked into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Kyla sound asleep, Martin Weiss suddenly found it ironic. She was sleeping peacefully, while he was sleepless because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He attended the consultation session and had a better understanding of how dangerous her situation was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did not have a liver transplant immediately after giving birth, her liver would fail much faster than normal. She might not even last a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A year? Does this woman only have a year to live?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he heard the specialists&rsquo; diagnosis during the consultation today, he felt a chill washing over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If she no longer exists in this world, what&hellip; what should I do?' His heart was contracting furiously as if it were sinking into a bottomless icy pond. The feeling continued to linger.</p></div>
