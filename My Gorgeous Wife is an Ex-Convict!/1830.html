        <h1>Chapter 1828</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She remembered how she often quipped, "Hadwin Stephenson, do you think we'll still kiss like this when we're in our 70s and 80s? Would we be tired of each other and no longer kiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Each time, he would say gently, "We won't get tired of each other. Lina, I will still kiss you when you're old. I will always kiss until I close my eyes and leave this world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... she and he would never have that. Not five years ago, not now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina did not resist or struggle but let Hadwin Stephenson deepen the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was like a farewell to her&mdash;a farewell to the relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the kiss finally ended, Lina heard Hadwin Stephenson's hoarse voice say, "Lina, you still love me, don't you? Do you know how badly I&rsquo;ve been wanting to kiss you like how I just did?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After five years, he could finally touch her like this again without the pain of the blood curse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, do you know that I chose to break up with you not only because I wanted to regain control of the Stephenson family and have what it takes to protect you in the future, but also because&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, before he could finish, Lina interrupted him. "If your idea of protecting me is dating another woman, then I would rather not have such protection."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stiffened and stared at her. There seemed to be a sense of imploring in his beautiful, deep, and dark eyes. "Lina, would you forgive me if I told you I did that to save your life and let you live?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at Hadwin Stephenson calmly. "You're not the one who protected my life but Grace. If it hadn't been for Grace, my family would have had to sell our house to pay for my surgery, not to mention the expensive fee from staying in the ICU!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She still remembered how worried her parents were when they told her this story after she recovered. If it had not been for Grace, she might have died!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson instantly turned pale. "Don't you... believe me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina asked, "How do you expect me to believe you? You keep saying you love me and you want to marry me, that you&rsquo;ve never loved Katherine Jackson. But why can she still enter your mansion if you&rsquo;ve broken up with her? It&rsquo;s been happening frequently too. Hadwin Stephenson, is this how you love someone? You're a liar!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson frowned. "It's not what you think. She came to my mansion because&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you mean it's not what I think? No one told me about this. I saw it with my own eyes. I saw her go into your mansion last night and leave this morning." Lina laughed bitterly and said, "Are you still going to tell me you have nothing to do with her? Are you going to say that although she stayed in your mansion the entire night, nothing happened between you two?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What if I say yes? I have nothing to do with her. She did spend the night at the mansion, but nothing happened between us! Lina, don&rsquo;t you believe me?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her answer disappointed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How am I supposed to believe you? Hadwin Stephenson, do you think I'm gullible? When we were dating, you told me we would never break up. I believed you, but then you broke up with me! Now, you want me to believe you again. You want me to believe that you and Katherine Jackson have nothing to do with each other and that you broke up with me so I could live? What a shame that I won't believe a word of it!"</p></div>
