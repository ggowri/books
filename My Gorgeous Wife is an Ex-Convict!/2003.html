        <h1>Chapter 2001</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "Since he cleared your name of his own accord, then I won't touch him. But now it seems that he might not have framed you for the eight million dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you mean?" Lina asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Anthony Sherman's sexual orientation is a little different," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sexual orientation?" Lina's eyes instantly widened. She asked with a face of disbelief, "Do you mean he likes men?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Although he doesn't have any intimate male lovers, he has been in and out of some special bars. He also regularly sees a psychological doctor. My mom bribed the psychological doctor and learned from them that Anthony Sherman is frustrated over having some inappropriate fantasies about men," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina did not expect Anthony Sherman to have such a problem. 'So he chose to frame me to keep his sexuality from being exposed?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'... If I think about it in another way, Hadwin's mother wouldn't have investigated everything about Anthony Sherman if I hadn't gone on a blind date with him. Anthony Sherman wouldn't have had to deal with this.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina thought of Anthony Sherman's apologies. He apologized once before the incident and once more today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If he just didn&rsquo;t want his private matters to be exposed, then I was the one who troubled him," said Lina. Suddenly, she seemed to have recalled something. "Is your mother going to expose that information now that he posted a clarification?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't worry, Yulai is just an abandoned pawn now. My mom probably won't even bother with an abandoned pawn like him. If Anthony Sherman's private information is exposed, it&rsquo;ll only prove that you two are innocent," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina thought about it and agreed, so she was finally relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, this is the end of the matter. Stop thinking about Anthony Sherman. He's... just a passerby in your life!" He disliked her thinking about another man, even if the man&rsquo;s sexual orientation was a little different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I got it," answered Lina. However, she seemed to say regretfully, "He could have just told me he was threatened with such a thing. I could have helped him think of a solution. He didn't have to take things so far. Besides, I wouldn't think less of him even if I found out. I'd even..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Help him find a boyfriend?" Hadwin Stephenson raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's expression instantly looked a little sheepish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Hadwin Stephenson's phone rang and he answered it. After listening to the other party for a moment, he said indifferently, "Okay, alright then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After the call ended, Lina could not help asking, "What's the matter? Is there something wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although he had the same expression, she could feel something different about him. At that instant, his body exuded loneliness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nothing." He smiled, looking like his usual self.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin, if something happened, I hope you can tell me. Maybe I might not be able to help you, but at least I can listen, lest I worry for nothing," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want to be the one receiving protection all the time. She wanted to share some of his burdens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's just that my mom has gone abroad. My staff was just informing me about it," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your mom... has gone abroad?" Lina was a little surprised. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;She went abroad... Does this mean his mom has run away in defeat?'</p></div>
