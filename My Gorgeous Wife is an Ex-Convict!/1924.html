        <h1>Chapter 1922</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If Katherine Jackson had asked Young master Reed to stab himself, he would probably have done it without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence walked out of the ward, leaving only Grace and Jason inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though the doctor had told Grace to stay in bed and rest as much as possible, she still got down from her bed and walked to Jason's bedside. Then, she sat in the soft chair beside the bed and quietly watched him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was alive, but he was seriously injured. He got all these wounds because of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, as long as he was alive, that was all that mattered to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace raised her hand and caressed Jason's hand that was by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His hands were also wrapped in gauze. He held her hand so tightly. He could have been safe if he had let her go, but he gave up the rope ladder and held her hand with both hands instead. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was tantamount to giving up his life just so he could be with her, regardless of life or death. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace gently held his hand when she suddenly felt his fingers moving slightly. She instantly turned her head and saw Jason's eyelashes quivering slightly. Then, his deep eyes slowly opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay..." Grace could not help shouting. Even though she did not manage to make a sound and it was painful, she could not help calling out his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes met Grace, and he seemed to freeze a little. He wanted to sit up but frowned when he felt the pain from his wounds. He had just undergone surgery. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace quickly raised her hands and pressed down on Jason's shoulders, gesturing him to lie down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason obediently lay back, looked at Grace, and asked, "Why aren't you lying down? You just got out of surgery too, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace picked up her phone and typed a line of words to Jason, telling him that her operation was only a minor operation. After all, the wound Katherine Jackson caused to her neck was only skin trauma and did not reach her trachea. It was just because the wound was relatively deep that it was slightly difficult to stitch it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His wounds were far more serious than hers. Before the doctor left the ward, she asked a few more questions and learned that his broken ribs had nearly punctured his organs. He might have been in real danger had the wounds been any further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace told Jason about her condition and the doctor's instructions by typing out the messages. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked at the words she typed line by line before looking at her face. He lifted his hand to reach her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;You're still on a drip. You can't lift your hand like this!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace urgently typed to remind him, but he held her face anyway. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His cold hand offset the warmth of her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'His hands are cold. Is it the drip?' Grace was thinking about it when she suddenly heard Jason say, "I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze and looked at him in surprise. She should be the one apologizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason muttered, "I'm sorry. I was wrong, Grace. I was wrong. I misunderstood. What I thought was real was fake. I misunderstood you. It&rsquo;s not because you didn&rsquo;t love me that you left me!&rdquo;</p></div>
