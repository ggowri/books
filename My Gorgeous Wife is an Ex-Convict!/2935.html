        <h1>Chapter 2933</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Grace is now married and if anyone should reveal Brian Hart's true feelings, it should be him, not her. Valda Theller struggled to find a response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Could it be... that you and he are not compatible in that aspect?" Madam Hart guessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart and Mr. Hart immediately understood and their expressions changed, but Valda Theller did not comprehend. However, Madam Hart's words gave her an excuse for her "just friends" relationship, so she quickly nodded and said, "Yes, that's right. So, we are not really suitable for each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she spoke, Mr. Hart looked at his son with surprise, while Brian Hart wore a helpless expression. He knew from Valda Theller's response that she did not understand his mother's meaning at all, but he did not know how to remind her of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Madam Hart quickly grabbed Valda Theller's hand and said, "I assure you, my son is perfectly healthy in that aspect. It may be due to stress or something else that caused your disharmony. I will find a way to get him some supplements to ensure that he is full of energy. You should also understand that he has little experience. Although some women prefer men who have been through many battles, lack of experience also shows that he takes relationships seriously."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller listened with confusion. Supplements? Full of energy? Lack of experience? She felt like she did not understand anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart could not bear to watch anymore and said, "Mom, this is between Valda Theller and me. Please don't interfere."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean don't interfere? This is a serious problem. You should know how many couples divorce because of disharmony in that aspect. Valda Theller thinks you are not good in that aspect, so she wants to break up with you. If you were good, I might have had a grandchild by now," Madam Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finally understood what Madam Hart meant. She felt embarrassed and wished she could bury herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What did she just say? Especially in front of the Hart family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um... Brian Hart is fine in that aspect, really fine. He doesn't need supplements, and lack of experience is also good..." Valda Theller tried to say something to make up for her mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But as soon as she spoke, she wished she could bite her tongue off. What was she saying? It would have been better not to say anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart and Brian Hart looked at her with a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, sometimes disharmony in that aspect can be resolved with good communication," Madam Hart said. "Valda Theller, my son is serious about you. Even if you have any conflicts, as long as you talk about it, you can solve it. Think carefully before you break up. He is not the kind of man who easily sacrifices himself for a woman, but if he does, it means he is serious about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Madam Hart's last sentence was spoken with great emphasis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was lost in thought even after Mr. Hart and Madam Hart left. He would sacrifice himself for her, which meant he was serious about her... Actually, she never doubted his seriousness. She was just regretful that the person he loved was not her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, I made your parents think that you..." Valda Theller blushed and felt embarrassed.</p></div>
