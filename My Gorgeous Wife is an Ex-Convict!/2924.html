        <h1>Chapter 2922</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a loud bang of the door, Valda Theller knew that Brian Hart had left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She collapsed onto the bed, sobbing uncontrollably. Why was it still so painful, even though she had already broken up with Brian Hart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain was so intense that even breathing felt like agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Brian Hart looked at the photos in his hand, his mind echoing Valda Theller's words from before - "These photos are not what they seem. He didn't hold me or kiss me. It's just the angle that creates this illusion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, it was true that from a certain angle, things could appear differently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As someone in the entertainment industry, the Hart family had a background in film and television, but he had never thought of this possibility!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even just these few photos had driven him to lose his rationality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had been calm, how could he not have thought of the possibility of a set-up?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, Brian Hart rubbed his head in frustration. What was wrong with him? He seemed to be becoming less and less like himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He couldn't bring himself to move on from Valda Theller, but he also couldn't bring himself to pursue her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This feeling of frustration was reminiscent of a long time ago, when he was with Grace and Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he really only like Valda Theller? Or perhaps this feeling was deeper than he had imagined?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">------------</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Valda Theller didn't go to the studio. She stayed in her apartment, crying all night, her eyes still swollen and red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she went to the studio, her two assistants would only speculate endlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All night long, all she could hear ringing in her ears were Brian Hart's apologies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sorry...sorry...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many times had he apologized to her during this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But did he know that every time he said sorry, it hurt her even more?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she could, she wished she would never hear him apologize to her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the next few days, Brian Hart didn't appear in front of her, and she saw news online about The Schuman family's tax evasion and fraudulent accounting. The relevant departments were checking the accounts of The Schuman family's industries, and the banks were also withdrawing their loans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It could be said that The Schuman family was finished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were also many gossip news about Barbara Schuman online, such as how she had recently sold all her designer bags and clothes, and was borrowing money from people everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was also news of Barbara Schuman entering a hotel with a certain boss late at night...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the photo of Barbara Schuman's haggard face, feeling a sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman who had given her a nightmare, the woman she thought she could only avoid, was now paying the price so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland, on the other hand, cheered at the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha, it's finally karma catching up to her. The Schuman family is finished, so what is Barbara Schuman? All her awards were just given to her through connections, and her friends all avoided her when they found out her family was in trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland suddenly thought of something and said, "By the way, do you think Brian Hart had something to do with The Schuman family's downfall?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was taken aback. "I don't know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Think about it, it's really possible. Otherwise, how could the timing be so coincidental? And that day, Raymond Bowman mentioned how Barbara Schuman bullied you, and she was going to pour wine on you, but Brian Hart stopped her. He must have been standing up for you, and that's why Barbara Schuman is in trouble now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller bit her lip. Could it be that Brian Hart had done all this for her...</p></div>
