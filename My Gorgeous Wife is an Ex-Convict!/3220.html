        <h1>Chapter 3218</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, even ordinary families have decent living conditions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for the Abbott family, Grace can tell that they are not well-off. She is worried that the child who is going to Jasper's place to learn music might have some psychological problems.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, I helped him. I don't want anyone to bully him," said Jasper matter-of-factly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So you must help him well, okay?" Grace gently stroked her daughter's hair and said with great emphasis, "You have to understand that you are the one who brought him into another world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper listened with a vague understanding, while Grace sighed inwardly, unsure whether this arrangement would be a blessing or a curse for Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, the Abbott couple is currently speaking to their son, saying, "Now that Miss. Reed has taken an interest in you, you must work hard. She wants you to learn to play more songs, so you must learn well, understand? You must please her! Our whole family's future depends on Miss. Reed! Do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence clenched his teeth tightly and after a while, he replied in a stuttering voice, "I understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Do you want to please Miss. Reed? But actually, even if Mommy and Daddy don't say it, he would still want her to be happy because he wants to see her smile more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her smile, he also feels happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But...after hearing this from his parents, he felt a sense of unease in his heart, as if he was doing something wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, when Jasper video called William, he enthusiastically mentioned Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh no, I forgot to record a video. Today, Lawrence and I took turns playing several songs, but I forgot to record it. However, Lawrence promised to learn the piano with me, so I can see him several times a week. I'll record a video for you then." said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was puzzled, "He wants to learn the piano with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, William, did you know? Lawrence never took piano lessons from a teacher before, he taught himself. He's really talented! If he had taken lessons from my teacher, he could have played even better." Jasper praised Lawrence, not realizing that the person on the other end of the video call had a change in expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you... like this Lawrence?" William asked, feeling uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper rarely uses the word "amazing" to describe someone's piano playing. In the past, he only used this word to praise someone, but now he has added "Lawrence" to the list.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I like it," she said readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's eyes dimmed and a feeling of discomfort suddenly surged in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... compared to me, who do you like more?" he suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at William strangely, "Why are you asking me this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I just want to know, do you like him more or me more?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But, you guys are different," Jasper murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's different?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence is my friend, but you, William, you are very important to me!" she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Very important...so I'm more important than Lawrence," William's heart warmed, and his face looked better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper nodded her head. Although she liked Lawrence's music and had good feelings towards him as a friend, William was very important to her and irreplaceable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's face improved after hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, you are the most important person to me," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To her, he was only a "very" important person because there were many people in her world who held important positions in her heart, such as her parents, siblings...but to him, she was the most important one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is so important to her that he is willing to do anything to protect her!</p></div>
