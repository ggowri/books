        <h1>Chapter 3571</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper quickly dialed the emergency number and then, after thinking for a moment, he also called his own bodyguards!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that her father would have bodyguards protecting her outside the school. Once she left the school gate, there should be Reed family bodyguards around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, after a moment, someone answered the phone on the other end. "Jasper, what's up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come save someone! Hurry to my alley and help me save the person who's been beaten up!" Jasper said urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment of silence on the other end of the phone, the person spoke in a strange tone. "Jasper, are you sure you really want to save someone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course I'm sure!" Is there any reason to doubt it? Every minute that passes, Roger will suffer more harm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But, that person probably doesn't need saving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Jasper was taken aback and turned his head to look down the alley. He saw that everyone around was lying on the ground, while Roger was standing there unscathed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked his eyes, wondering what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people around him who were watching were equally shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who would have thought that things would turn out so unexpectedly? The person who was supposed to be beaten up was actually the one doing the beating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thugs were writhing on the ground in pain when suddenly a police car arrived. Jasper saw a police officer get out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd that had gathered to watch the commotion immediately opened up a path as the police walked into the alley and looked at the thugs lying on the ground before turning to Roger. "Did you beat up these people?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Roger could answer, a woman's voice suddenly spoke up. "I can testify that he acted in self-defense!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, everyone's gaze turned to Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger looked at Jasper, who had her hand raised and wore a righteous expression, with a deep gaze. Her appearance... it only made him feel uncomfortable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group went into the police station, and Jasper, as a witness, also came to the station to give a statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing the transcript, she walked to the lobby of the police station and saw Roger coming out of the interrogation room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"According to the testimony of multiple eyewitnesses, it has been proven that the other party was the first to use physical force, so you can go now," the police said to Roger. "However, you need to keep your phone on and be ready to come back if necessary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, several injured thugs also came out of the interrogation room. When they saw Roger, they immediately shouted, "We're going to sue this guy! It wasn't self-defense, it was excessive force!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to sue him for excessive force, you can certainly do so!" a police officer said. "This is a police station, not a place for you to cause trouble!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The faces of those thugs changed slightly. The leader walked up to Roger and stared at him fiercely, saying, "Kid, I remember you. You won't have a good life from now on. Aren't you a student at Stanford University? I'll make sure you can't stay at Stanford University anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger frowned and was about to speak when a figure stepped in front of him faster and spoke in a proud tone, "If you dare to trouble him again in the future, believe it or not, I can make you unable to stay in Emerald City!"</p></div>
