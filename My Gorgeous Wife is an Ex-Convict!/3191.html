        <h1>Chapter 3189</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi was at a loss and said, "Mom, what do we do now? How can I continue in the entertainment industry? After today's incident, everyone at school will know that my cousin and I have fallen out. Even if I want to get some resources, it will be difficult!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert couple also looked worried. Auntie Sandy scolded her daughter, "Why did you provoke Valda again? Haven't you learned your lesson from last time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just can't stand Valda, who would have thought that Brian would protect that cripple like this!" Lexi broke out in frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Auntie Sandy looked at her daughter and sighed. But in the future, that cripple would be the glorious lady of the Hart family, and what about them, the Lambert family? Without the protection of the Hart family, how long could they hold on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps things would only get worse year by year and eventually they would become an ordinary family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's a pity that her daughter is still only thinking about the resources in the entertainment industry, without considering the more serious problems that the Lambert family will face in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert couple exchanged a glance, without saying anything. However, they both saw the deep concern for the future in each other's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, after Valda got into the car with Brian, they drove to the entrance of a bridal shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding dresses here are all high-end and therefore come with a hefty price tag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Brian and said, "You brought me here..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's look at wedding dresses. Although our wedding day is still half a year away, there are some things that we need to start preparing for," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda thought about it and decided to follow Brian into the bridal shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the store, she was a bit absent-minded when it came to choosing a wedding dress, as her mind kept wandering to Lexi's situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Lexi is not at fault for what happened, it was because of her that he had a falling out with his relatives. And in the future, how many more people will he have to confront in order to defend her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Brian's voice sounded in Valda's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much, just thinking, will people criticize you for falling out with your relatives because of me?" She expressed her concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If someone really wants to say something, then let them say it. I protect my own woman, and I don't see any problem with that," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have my own woman" - these words made Valda's heart fill with sweetness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being protected by such a man is truly a happy thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, don't overthink it. It's time to choose a wedding dress. Look at which style you like and you can discuss the details with the designer later," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And inside the store, rows and rows of wedding dresses are all beautiful and exquisite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crystals and diamonds embedded in the wedding dress are rarely seen on ordinary wedding dresses. As a result, the price is definitely not affordable for ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at all these wedding dresses, Valda was a bit overwhelmed and didn't know which one to choose. They all looked so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff then brought out a booklet which contained pictures of models wearing some of the key wedding dresses, as well as introductions to various wedding dress designers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The designers who collaborate here are well-known wedding dress designers from both China and abroad, many of whom have won numerous awards.</p></div>
