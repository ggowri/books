        <h1>Chapter 3256</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing special," Valda said awkwardly. "But I haven't really played much in the past two years, so I don't know if I've gotten worse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Brian's forehead immediately formed a black line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What level of proficiency would it be with an average technical level, plus a decline?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If... um, if you really had to take off your shirt today, don't mind me," Valda stuttered, "I'll make sure to practice my card playing skills and try not to do that next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Next time?" Brian raised an eyebrow. Did his wife still expect to have such a bet again in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After chatting for a while, the four women began to choose their partners by directly showing their palms and backs of their hands to see who would be paired with whom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The final outcome is that Lina and Grace are a team, and Kyla and Valda are another team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Four women sat around a square table, while four men gathered on the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How good is your wife's card playing?" Brian asked Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"About the level of a middle school student," said Martin. Kyla usually loses to Nelson, this middle school student, when playing cards at home, so Martin's comment is understandable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Upon hearing this, Brian was momentarily at a loss for words and could only silently mourn to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, as long as Valda is happy, it doesn't matter. It's just taking off a piece of clothing for his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Jason and Hadwin, they have known each other for many years because of their wives and often meet each other. They have played cards together before and both know each other's wives' card skills, so there's no need to ask about that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just because he understood the situation, Hadwin was feeling particularly embarrassed at the moment. "If it really comes down to us having to take off our clothes later, please forgive us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lina's card skills, Grace probably can't handle unless the opponent has worse card skills," said Jason bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin chuckled dryly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My own wife is really... not only is she bad at playing cards, but she also came up with this terrible idea and ended up tricking her own husband and her teammate's husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regarding this, Hadwin is speechless and unable to comment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The game began, and because it involved the issue of the four men's clothing, all four men became interested in the game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Overall, Grace is the most skilled player and can also count cards. However, unfortunately, she was dragged down by her teammate Lina, who played like a pig, and suffered a miserable defeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some games that were originally winnable ended up being lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla and Valda's card skills are not very impressive, but luckily they are evenly matched and cooperate well with each other, so they can still hold their own in the game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Four people, back and forth, you win one round, then I win one round.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four men on the side looked pitiful as their clothes became increasingly scanty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Four men looked at each other, their clothes were all worn out and barely covering their bodies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If another woman were to come in and see this, she might not be able to resist screaming out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the game is being played exceptionally fiercely, and four men are paying particularly close attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, in this game, the husbands of the losing team may end up playing shirtless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The men were staring intently at the card game, as if it was more important than a multi-billion dollar business deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the contrary, women are playing cards while chatting casually, appearing extremely relaxed.</p></div>
