        <h1>Chapter 278</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the problem was that people like him had seen a lot of cute people. Was the photo of her when she was little so cute that he had to keep one for himself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, however, meeting Lina was the most important thing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was about to leave, Jason asked the driver to take her there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew from experience that it was useless to refuse. Once he had made up his mind, there was little room for negotiation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she got into the car, Grace told the driver where to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, she arrived half an hour earlier for what was supposed to be an hour-long trip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked into a fast food restaurant. She took a seat, ordered a drink that cost six dollars, and sent Lina a message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While she was waiting for her best friend, she casually looked through the transparent French window and watched several food delivery riders running in and out of the restaurant from time to time with their food delivery orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Food deliveries... Grace felt a twinge of emotion. Grace's driver's license had been canceled, but that did not mean she could not ride a motorcycle. Besides, the food delivery job was distributed according to the work done. She would not get a basic salary, but the more she did, the more she would get paid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she could pass the recruitment process with her criminal record, then perhaps delivering food could be a good occupation for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she kept taking leave from her job at the Sanitation Service Center, Claire's workload would increase greatly. It was like pushing someone else to help her finish her work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the salary at the Sanitation Service Center was fixed. Now that she needed to bear a quarter of her grandmother's medical expenses, she was short of money...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you thinking?" Lina's voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace instantly came back to her senses and looked at her friend who had already arrived. "I'm wondering whether I should be a food delivery rider," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was shocked. "You want to deliver food? It's hard work, and you&rsquo;ll receive complaints from customers. Women rarely work as food delivery riders and don't have the stamina to keep up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Usually, these jobs were done by men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At least I won't drag others down," Grace said. "Doing a good job or a bad job is my business. It's not like the Sanitation Service Center where if you ask for leave, you have to get someone else to do the work for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's true," Lina said. As if she had thought of something, she then said, "By the way, why are you here so early today? Are you on leave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered that her best friend's off-duty time was later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I hurt my hand, and I had to take a few days off, so I thought I might as well just change my job," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina realized that her friend's fingers were covered with gauze. "How did your hands become like that? What happened?" she asked hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not keep her best friend in the dark but briefly told her what had happened last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina listened, gritting her teeth. "How can there be a father like yours? Even if he wants to play favorites with Evelyn, he can't do that to you! He knows how much that album means to you, and he still burned it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed at herself. 'Yeah, a man like that is my father!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, her mood had changed to indifference. After all, she had already known that her father's heart no longer held a single affection for her mother, let alone blood ties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, her father would have visited her when she was in prison.</p></div>
