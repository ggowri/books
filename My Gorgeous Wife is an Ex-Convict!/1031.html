        <h1>Chapter 1030</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately felt like she was being spoiled. 'Come to think of it, besides my parents, only Hadwin Stephenson would spoil me like this.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She leaned on the couch as she hummed. Hadwin Stephenson saw the grimace on her face and asked, "Does it hurt a lot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." She nodded miserably. "You men are lucky that you don't have to suffer this pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand and gently rubbed it against her tummy. "Does this help?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um. That's pretty good. Go on and let me enjoy a while," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the Stephenson family's patriarch continued to gently rub a woman's tummy as he bent a little while sitting on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was enjoying herself. Moments later, she comfortably narrowed her eyes and yelled, "Hey, don't stop. Keep going... Wow, you have skills."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was rendered speechless. 'Does she have any idea how ambiguous her words sound?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina never expected her boyfriend to be so good at &lsquo;massaging&rsquo;. If she knew how comfortable it was to have him rub her stomach, she would have asked him to do it every time her period came. That way, she would not have to bother saying she wanted to rest at home every time she had period cramps!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the servant's voice rang in her ears. "Mr. Stephenson, the brown sugar ginger tea is ready."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately opened her eyes and said to the servant, "Give it to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servant then handed her the enamel cup filled with the drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can go," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servant responded, but before she left, she could not help stealing a glance at the two people, feeling that there was about to be new gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina lowered her head and started to drink her brown sugar ginger tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take your time. Be careful," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," she muttered. After taking a small sip, she realized the temperature was acceptable and continued sipping it in small sips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes she thought he paid more attention to the little things than her mother, so that was probably why she felt spoiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Being spoiled by the person you loved felt really good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Feeling better?" he asked after a while, his beautiful eyes full of concern for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if she was being seduced, and her heart started racing. If she was not in this unfavorable condition today, she might have pressed him on the couch and had her way with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" he asked again after seeing that she was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah, no-nothing. I feel much better now," she said quickly, getting rid of the jumble of thoughts in her head. 'Um, it seems that I easily turn into a pervert in front of him!'</p></div>
