        <h1>Chapter 3279</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the weekend, Lawrence and Jasper finished their piano lessons and returned to the Reed House. Jasper was thinking about the new piece he learned that day and asked Lawrence, "The teacher said you played it very well. Can you play it again for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." Lawrence obediently nodded his head. For him, playing the piano for her was actually the happiest thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he feels useful because she likes his music!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence put down his backpack and sat in front of the piano. He lifted his hands and began to play on the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fingers moved nimbly across the keys, producing a continuous stream of notes from his fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was deeply engrossed in listening. Although it was a new piece he had just learned, he played it smoothly. One would have to listen carefully to detect the slight imperfections in his playing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the teacher said, Lawrence has made significant progress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, she always found it difficult to find someone her age who was at a similar level to her. The feeling of not having a worthy opponent always left her feeling a bit disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she participated in some piano competitions and met some peers who played very well, their piano sounds did not give her the urge to keep listening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Lawrence's music would not be like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Jasper was thoroughly enjoying the music, Lawrence suddenly stumbled in his playing. The music continued, but it was no longer as smooth as before, and there were even a few mistakes in the notes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper furrowed his brows involuntarily, his eyes filled with confusion. Could it be that he played the wrong notes because of the new song?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, her face suddenly changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On Lawrence's face, there was a look of pain, as if he was trying to endure something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with you?" Jasper quickly approached and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...it's nothing," Lawrence replied, suppressing the pain and continuing to play. He had made a mistake in his playing because he had been distracted by their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper noticed Lawrence's discomfort and quickly grabbed him, asking, "What's wrong? Where do you feel uncomfortable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of the piano abruptly stopped, and his right hand was trembling uncontrollably. She was startled and immediately held his right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He tightly bit his lip, preventing the pain from screaming out of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is your hand hurting?" Jasper asked, carefully examining Lawrence's right hand. It was still trembling and there was a slight swelling around the wrist when he touched it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Lawrence spoke with some difficulty, "It's...it's okay. I'm just a little bit sore, it'll be fine soon." As he spoke, he seemed to want to prove that he wasn't in too much pain and that he could still play the piano. He also wanted to put his hands back on the piano keys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was quickly grabbed, but his right hand was accidentally clenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cry of pain suddenly burst from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, I'm sorry!" She quickly apologized, "Does it hurt a lot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, just a little bit painful..." he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll tell the butler and take you to the hospital," Jasper said. At the moment, her parents were not at home, so she first looked for the butler.</p></div>
