        <h1>Chapter 1846</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts said, "We really want to pay our respects. We think it&rsquo;d be disrespectful not to pay the dead our respects since we're already here. Why don't you bend the rules this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace only found what her mentor said a little far-fetched. After all, they did not need to pay their respects, but since her mentor and his wife wanted to do it so much, she said, "Okay, I'll talk to Jay. I'll take you there if Jay agrees."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright," said Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace told Jason about the matter in the evening. "My mentor and his wife would like to go to the Reed family's cemetery to pay their respects to my father-in-law. Can they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Pay their respects?" Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "Whose suggestion was this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "Mrs. Watts suggested it, and my mentor also wants to do it. I know outsiders aren't allowed to enter, but they mean well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason pursed his thin lips. His eyes showed that he seemed to be thinking about something. Moments later, he said, "You can take them there if they want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You&rsquo;re not coming?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He muttered, "Me? I'll be there later." The results would be out tomorrow, and he would find out whether the woman was really her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she was not, he would personally thank them for paying their respects to his father and make sure they left Emerald City safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, if she was her... then he would make that woman confess and repent her sins in front of his father's grave!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, you&rsquo;ll never betray me, right?" She would not betray him like how that woman betrayed his father, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why are you asking me that again?" she asked with a smile. She knew he was sensitive and skeptical. She just wanted him to feel more secure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could sense his unease, though she thought she had imagined it because he seemed normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, I won't betray you. I&rsquo;ve told you this before. I'll give you the same answer even if you ask a hundred times or a thousand times," she said as she took his face in her hands, stood on her tiptoes, and kissed him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The warm kiss seemed to be proof of what she said. His body stiffened before relaxing. He opened his mouth to accept her kiss. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I already know this. She's not like my mother. She won't betray me. I&rsquo;ve known this all along, haven&rsquo;t I?' He told himself not to think about it even if his mind was full of images that should not appear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, I love you. You're the one I love the most," he said to her when the kiss was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Likewise, she was the person who could hurt him most if she betrayed him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Three DNA reports were placed in front of Jason. Terrence lowered his head, not daring to look at his boss' reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Who would have thought that the biological mother Young master Reed had been looking for was the wife of Grace's mentor? He wondered if it was a small world or Young master Reed was shrewd enough to investigate Mrs. Watts's past and check her DNA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can leave first," Jason said coldly, his cold face showing little emotion at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," Terrence quickly walked out of his office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason picked up the three DNA reports and looked at the final results. They were all the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was enough to prove that Mrs. Watts... was the woman he was looking for!</p></div>
