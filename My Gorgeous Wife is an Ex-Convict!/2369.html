        <h1>Chapter 2367</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." Skye Maldonado hesitated for a moment before saying with a smile, "Alright, I'll call you Kyla. I've made some breakfast suitable for pregnant women. See if it&rsquo;s to your taste."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Skye Maldonado said as she brought out the breakfast from the kitchen. Then, she saw Kyla searching for something on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, what are you looking for? Let me help you find it," said Skye Maldonado.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I left a book on the couch last night. Did you see it when you came over this morning?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it the one with a red cover?" asked Skye Maldonado as she recalled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, the one with a red cover."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I saw Mr. Weiss reading it this morning. Did Mr. Weiss take it with him?" Skye Maldonado said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was immediately petrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin Weiss was... reading that book?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But the problem is... that book is a romance novel!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin Weiss was reading romance novels? Or is it because of something else?' Kyla did not know how to describe what she was feeling at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in the office, Mallory Malcom was at a loss for words as he looked at the romance novel sitting on the chairman's desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Loving You For The Rest Of My Life&hellip;&rsquo; Uh... The title clearly indicated that it was a romance novel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The chairman doesn't seem to be a fan of such romance novels, though!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was lying open, obviously half-read. It was set aside as though the reader intended to return and resume reading it later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "I've had a look at LJ's acquisition proposal, but there are still many problems. If we proceed with the current plan, we'll likely fail. Tell them to come up with a new proposal. No more half-baked proposals or they can leave... What are you looking at?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Mallory Malcom suddenly came back to his senses. "N-Nothing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss followed his gaze, landing on the novel. "What's the matter? Are you interested in novels like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An awkward smile instantly appeared on Mallory Malcom's face. It seemed inappropriate no matter what answer he gave. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">" It's good to read... such books once in a while." It took him a long time to think of such a statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you read them occasionally?" Martin Weiss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My girlfriend enjoys them, and I occasionally read them. But most of what she reads is online. She rarely reads physical books," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you think women like such novels?" Martin Weiss's fingers caressed the book. "Is it because they enjoy the romance these books talk about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think so. Every time my girlfriend reads such novels, she says how good the male protagonists are and how envious she is of the female protagonists." Mallory Malcom could not help complaining.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His girlfriend always compared him to the male characters in novels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Envious of the female protagonists in novels?" Martin Weiss murmured. 'What about Kyla... Is she also envious of the female protagonists in novels when she reads them?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Mallory Malcom left his office, Martin Weiss continued flipping the pages and reading the novel.</p></div>
