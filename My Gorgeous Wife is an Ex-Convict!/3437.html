        <h1>Chapter 3435</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, the girls at school also started to pursue Mason one after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every day, there are girls who give love letters or gifts to Mason, but he always throws them away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, those girls are not discouraged. After all, he is the second son of the Reed family. If they can really catch him, their destiny could be changed forever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Look, isn't Veronica the perfect example?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Mason only treats Veronica as a sister, Veronica can live such a good life. If there is a chance to become Mason's girlfriend, wouldn't it be better than Veronica's current situation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After school, Veronica watched as Mason packed his backpack. Another love letter fell out of his drawer, along with a beautifully wrapped gift box. It must have been a carefully chosen gift from some girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason simply picked up the love letter and gift, and threw them directly into the trash can at the back of the classroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked and couldn't help but say, "Why don't you open it up and take a look? Maybe this girl could be someone you like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't." He said with absolute certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You haven't even seen the love letter the other person wrote, let alone met them. How do you know you won't fall for them?" She asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he looked at her with unwavering eyes and said, "I am certain that I won't fall for this person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because for him, there was already someone he liked, and this person was the most important person in his life, someone he would never give up to anyone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if he had to resort to any means, he would get this person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under his gaze, her heart suddenly fluttered, and she quickly avoided his eyes and said, "Okay, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason didn't say anything and just picked up their backpacks and headed towards the school gate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when they reached the bottom of the teaching building, they ran into Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel looked at the two of them, seeming hesitant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong, Mr. Cross?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel felt a bit embarrassed and said, "Actually, I just wanted to ask if you're free this weekend to come watch me play basketball. Our school team has a game against No. 3 Middle School."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica remembered that she had promised Daniel that she would go watch him play a game, but for this weekend... She looked a bit embarrassed and glanced at Mason standing next to her. After a moment, she said to Daniel, "I had originally planned to go to the bookstore with Mason this weekend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see." Daniel's expression seemed a bit disappointed, but then he said, "If you don't mind, how about coming to watch me play basketball? After the game, I can accompany you to the bookstore to buy books. The game won't take too long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Daniel had conflicts with Mason in the past, he naturally hoped to have a better relationship with him because Mason is Veronica's "brother".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" Veronica furrowed her brow upon hearing Daniel's suggestion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she knew that Mason didn't like Daniel. He had even destroyed the ointment that Daniel had given her twice before. They had even had a cold war for several days because of Daniel's relationship. So it was clear that Mason would never agree.</p></div>
