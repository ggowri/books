        <h1>Chapter 3302</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll let you see it alone," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled and couldn't help but start touching his face with her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" He glanced at her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just touch it however you want," she chuckled, "with such a handsome husband, it's not worth it if I don't touch him a few more times." In reality, she was a bit aroused by his gaze just now, but she couldn't do anything to him, so she could only satisfy herself by touching him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He finished massaging her left leg and switched to the right leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, she was touching his cheeks, then moved to his neck, especially her fingers were stroking his Adam's apple back and forth, as if playing with some new toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Brian usually had good self-control, he couldn't resist the teasing of his beloved wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His phoenix eyes became deeper, and his voice became a bit hoarse as he asked, "How long do you plan to play?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" She was startled, looking at his expression, she realized that she had gone too far, "I...um..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you like to play?" he said softly, looking at her with a gaze that carried a hint of heat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face turned red involuntarily, and she subconsciously wanted to retract her hand, but his hand was faster and pressed hers against his neck. "Is it intentional?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" she looked at him blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He leaned closer, his face getting closer and closer to hers, his breath spraying on her cheek, making her face even redder. All her attention seemed to be taken by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you intentionally teasing me like this?" his low voice sounded in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it's not intentional," she denied weakly after a while, but her denial seemed so weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whether it's intentional or not, please try not to do this during this time," he whispered, "Do you know how much self-restraint I need to hold back my impulses?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blinked her eyes, and she could only hear Brian's deep voice continuing, "Valda, do you know how much I want you? And how afraid I am of your touch? I'm afraid that for my own pleasure, I might hurt you and the child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda then noticed that there were faint veins popping out on his forehead, and the veins on his arms were even more obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So... he was enduring, and enduring very hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Valda felt a twinge of guilt in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was just a passing fancy, but it made him have to endure so much hardship. "I'm...I'm sorry!" she apologized with guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't need to apologize, you haven't done anything wrong," Brian said, kissing her lips. This was the most he could do right now, as he was afraid of losing control if he did more. "Actually, I'm glad you're interested in me. It's just that my self-control isn't as good as you might think, so please bear with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he gently embraced her and said, "After you have given birth to our child, you can have whatever you want, and I will provide it for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The low murmuring voice was hoarse and magnetic. Valda's face was starting to blush because his words felt like the biggest temptation to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a while, she murmured, "Then you... must keep your promise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I will keep my word."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he loved her so much.</p></div>
