        <h1>Chapter 2131</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at Kyla, then at Martin Weiss. She hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Alright, someone's taking me home, so why don't you go home first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, we'll go home, then!" Grace and Jason then headed for their car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla followed Martin Weiss to his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two got into the car, and Martin Weiss said as he drove, "Are you really going to have the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I want to give birth to this baby. Besides, we haven't had the results from the consultation with the doctor. Maybe it isn't as serious as we think," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But haven't you seen what happened to Lina today? Didn't you say everything went well with her pregnancy check-ups? But she still had a difficult labor and almost died," said Martin Weiss. Even though it was not Kyla who had a difficult labor, his heart still fluttered with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He kept thinking about what he would do if the same situation arose. He was afraid he would end up like Hadwin Stephenson in the delivery room!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What happened to Lina was a coincidence. Some incidents will still happen, but they&rsquo;re rare,&rdquo; said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said quickly, "But I don't want that coincidence to happen to you! I don't want to take the risk even if it's one in ten million."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The atmosphere in the car suddenly became grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the car arrived at the store&rsquo;s entrance and Kyla was about to get off after saying goodbye, Martin Weiss grabbed her hand. He leaned over. "Give up the baby, okay? I was wrong to have knocked you up, and I shouldn't have insisted that you keep the baby. I beg you to abort the baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was scared! He was truly scared!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was scared every minute he spent outside the delivery room today. He was scared that she would have the same near-death experience one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He never thought it was difficult for a woman to give birth. At most, those like Grace who was pregnant with triplets would struggle a little, but giving birth to a baby normally should be a no-brainer. Moreover, with advanced medical technology nowadays, there would be nothing to worry about as long as one had arranged good doctors and hospitals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, only today did he find out that he was wrong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One could only watch some things happen but were powerless to change them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla glared at Martin Weiss and suddenly sneered. "Martin Weiss, you're so full of yourself! You wanted this baby, so you forced me to keep them. Now that I want to keep the baby, you said you were wrong and you want me to abort the baby. What do you think I am? What do you think this baby is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I just don't want to lose you!" Martin Weiss said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's smile grew colder. "We're not your belongings. We're not something you can keep and throw as you want. Martin Weiss, you're still the same after all these years. Didn't you treat me the same way back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His face instantly paled, and his blood seemed to freeze because of what she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She shoved him away and got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He sat in the car in a daze. Suddenly, he began to laugh madly. However, the laughter turned into a sob as he laughed. Then, tears rolled down his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It turned out she still thought he was the same as back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She thought he was trying to manipulate her, but she could not see how much he cared about her!</p></div>
