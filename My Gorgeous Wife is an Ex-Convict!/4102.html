        <h1>Chapter 4100</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina thought she would meet someone from the Hunter family, but after a meal, she didn't see anyone, not even Mr. Hunter. Chandler took her back to the car directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where are your parents and grandfather? Shouldn't I say goodbye to them before I leave?" Tina couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My parents are not at home, and there's no need to see my grandfather." Chandler said. He went to see his grandfather this morning, hoping that his grandfather would not act on his own and not touch Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter what happens between him and Tina in the future, he doesn't want her to be bound by the Hunter family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she doesn't want to, he won't force her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for last night, it was the best memory for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler drove the car towards Emerald City himself, without hiring a driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the way, Tina asked again, "By the way, last night, I heard Grandpa say outside the church that he wanted us to get married soon and have children early, so that you wouldn't be in pain. Is there any connection?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler's hand on the steering wheel tightened. "I'll tell you slowly in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Couldn't he tell her now? Fortunately, Tina wasn't the type to pry into things. She just said, "But Grandpa was wrong. I'm not the kind of person who can be easily tempted. I will definitely marry you. It's hard to find a husband like you now. Eugenia said I was lucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler hesitated for a moment. "We didn't use protection last night. Let's go to the pharmacy to buy some medicine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Buy medicine?" Tina was surprised. "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You're still too young. If you really are pregnant..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Then I'll give birth!" she said confidently. "There are many mothers at my age, and when my mom was pregnant with me, she didn't think about getting an abortion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So if she really was pregnant, she would definitely give birth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler pursed his thin lips and a complex emotion flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Don't you like children?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No, I don't dislike children," he said. In fact... if she really gave birth to their child, it would mean that the parasites in his body could be cured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But if she really was pregnant, did he have the courage to tell her everything?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Would she be disappointed in him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Would she think he had been using her all along?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In fact, he had been with her since she was very young, cultivating their relationship, with the intention of using her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But he never expected that he would be the one who fell deeper in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I also like children," Tina smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Especially their child, she should like him/her very much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In her mind, she began to imagine what their child would look like, waving little hands in her arms, calling her "mommy," and she would kiss the baby's little face...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm, just thinking about it feels wonderful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But will your parents agree? If you really get pregnant, it could mean dropping out of school and affecting your studies," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But compared to a little life, it's worth it, isn't it?" Tina said. "And don't worry, my mom will definitely support my decision. As for my dad...well, you just have to dress a little more modestly when you come to my house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought her dad would probably beat up Chandler, though!</p></div>
