        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, he flicked Lina on the forehead. "What on earth is going on in your head? How could I possibly fall for him? You're the only one I&rsquo;d fall for!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, thanks to what Jason just did, she started becoming concerned about him. Hadwin Stephenson wondered if he should thank Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She finally closed her eyes and fell asleep, feeling relieved after he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson glanced at her sleeping face and continued driving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Our wedding should be on the agenda too. I want her to be my wife, the official mistress of the Stephenson family!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the car, Grace asked Jason, "Would you have kissed Hadwin Stephenson if Lina hadn&rsquo;t stopped you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows and asked, "What about you? Did you want me to kiss him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'This question is...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're my husband. How could I possibly expect you to kiss him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said nonchalantly, "Really? I thought you enjoyed watching these things but was too embarrassed to tell me. Otherwise, I would have known what TV shows you were watching."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ahem, ahem..." Grace almost choked herself. "You... You're overthinking it. Why don't I tell you about all the TV shows I'm watching from now on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is the TV show on tonight?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah, yes... There's an episode every Monday to Friday,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really? Let's watch it together tonight,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was dumbstruck. 'Watch it together tonight?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you sure... you want to watch it with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Of course. I think I'll enjoy the TV shows you like too." He smiled slightly, and it was so enchanting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina woke up in the lounge in Hadwin Stephenson's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was sitting beside the bed, looking intently at his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you looking at?" she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nothing, I'm just checking the documents we need to bring for marriage registration online," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's sleepy eyes instantly widened. What little drowsiness she had was instantly gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What did you say... Marriage registration?" she asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at her and smiled. "What's the matter? Don't you want to marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Uh..." She hesitated. "I... I do want to marry you, but I... I'm a little shocked when you brought up marriage all of a sudden."</p></div>
