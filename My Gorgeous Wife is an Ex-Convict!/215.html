        <h1>Chapter 214</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn had always felt uneasy at the thought of Brian. After all, up until now, Brian had not really &lsquo;touched&rsquo; her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, she was Brian's official girlfriend now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Grace, she would make her understand that everything in life was cyclical. Previously, she had asked Grace for help but got rejected. Now, she would make Grace understand what she had to pay for saying no!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">-</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director got the extras to rehearse twice before the formal shooting. When they were rehearsing, Grace did not see Lily. Lily's stand-in was representing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn did not let her stand-in represent her. Instead, she did it herself and stood next to the male lead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was the second female lead in this film. She was the male lead's mistress and had a lot of scenes with Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had given Evelyn a few films to choose from, and she immediately chose this one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian even said, "I thought you'd choose the ones where you can be the leading lady. You'll only be the second female lead in this one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This drama's a big production, the director's a famous director, the male lead has won the best actor twice, and the female lead, Lily, is really popular right now. Even if I'm just the second female lead in the cast, it's still better than being the female lead in other low-budget films," she had replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, only Evelyn knew that these were just excuses. The reason she joined the cast was just to show off to Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily used to look down at her! When she went to Sean for a role, Lily treated her like trash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she wanted Lily to know that even if she was only a second female lead in this film, she could also overpower the female lead, Lily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was a surprise that Grace had come here as an extra!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a great pleasure to be able to show off in front of these two people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they finished the second rehearsal, the director was about to start filming when Evelyn suddenly said, "Director, I think they didn't kneel orderly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not orderly?" The director was stunned. He felt that it was alright. After all, they were only extras, so it was impossible for them to be completely uniform like soldiers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's not orderly. I think it'll affect the scene. Why don't they kneel a few more times and practice until it's neater? I don't mind practicing with them. After all, I just want a good scene!" Evelyn said as if she was a professional who was doing it for the film's sake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the director was confused at Evelyn's sudden request, she was, after all, the entertainment industry prince's new girlfriend. He could not offend her right now and could only try his best to meet her requirements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, at the director's command, the extras once again kneeled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, of course, kneeled and groveled with the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was intentionally standing in front of her, making it seem that Grace was kneeling and groveling to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that Evelyn was doing it intentionally, but now, it seemed that even the director was following Evelyn's lead. Unless she no longer wanted her part-time salary, she would have to obediently follow orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking about how she still owed Lina her grandmother's medical bills, Grace gnashed her teeth and forced herself to hold on.</p></div>
