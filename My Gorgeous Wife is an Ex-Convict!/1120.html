        <h1>Chapter 1119</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We&hellip; We should get married, but... don't you think it's a bit too soon?" stammered Lina. After all, in just three months, she was about to go from being an unmarried woman to being... a married one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all happening too fast!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it?" he murmured, his eyes growing darker. "But it's too slow for me. Ever since you pressed me under you that night, I had already thought of making you my wife someday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was a serious person, and if he had not wanted to be with this woman for the rest of his life, he would never have let her do that to him and have a night of passion with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, it was not fast but slow for him. It was so slow that he waited until today to ask her to marry him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's face turned red, and she looked blankly at Hadwin Stephenson. Taking a deep breath, she held his face as if she had made up her mind and said earnestly, "Okay, we'll get married in three months!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she kissed his lips!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter what happened in the future, they would hold each other's hands and grow old together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The night was dark. Terrence stood in front of Splashes of Blood's door, looking at the closed door with some anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed had been in this room since after dinner and had not come out yet. Calculating the time, it had been almost six hours!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did something happen to... Master Reed in there?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence suddenly thought of the long sword in the room in the glass display case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the long sword had lost its sharpness after so many years, but... If one wanted to do something with it, it was not impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Terrence thought about it, the more uneasy he became. As he saw time ticking by, he suddenly stepped forward. He was about to knock on the door when the door was suddenly opened and Jason came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed!" said Terrence. He looked at the boss in front of him. 'Good, he doesn't seem to have any injuries.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Master Reed was like a piece of ice, making people feel as if they would be covered in frost whenever they got close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed had been like this since Miss Cummins left with Young Master Hart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence could not help sighing in his heart as he thought of the scene where Grace knelt in front of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though it looked like Grace was begging Master Reed, he was actually the one begging Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Master Reed was looking down at Grace, who at the time was kneeling on the ground, Terrence felt that Master Reed could not have been any meeker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After following Jason for many years, Terrence naturally knew that his boss was really hurt by Grace this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was probably the only one who could hurt Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Seal up the mansion!" Jason's voice came coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was stunned. "Seal it up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, no one is allowed to set foot here from now on!" said Jason.</p></div>
