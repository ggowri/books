        <h1>Chapter 1192</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Innocent?" Brian suddenly sneered. "The police have found the surveillance footage of the scene that proves that everything was as Stella said. Besides, none of the five witnesses know each other, so there&rsquo;s no possibility that they&rsquo;re lying! The statements of all five are consistent so far!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly said, "Have you ever felt what it&rsquo;s like to be wronged?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" He was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've been wronged, and all the evidence and witness statements point to you. Even if you know you're innocent, you&rsquo;re unable to convince others. Have you ever felt this way?" She smiled faintly. "I have, so I can understand how Chase Harper feels right now. I'll help him no matter what!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were pressed together tightly, and his eyes seemed to see through her. "Will you still help Chase Harper even if I ask you not to interfere in his affairs?'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's my friend, and I believe him." She met his eyes without flinching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air around them had a stagnant depression!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After studying Chase Harper's case for a few days, Grace found that everything was indeed against Chase Harper. Although she had various doubts, she knew Chase Harper had no intention of raping Stella. Everything was probably set up by Stella!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her suspicions did not produce a chain of evidence. Instead, the surveillance footage, witnesses, and Stella's confession formed a powerful chain of evidence against Chase Harper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, the witnesses did not see what had happened in the car. All they saw was Stella running out of the car while shouting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that in law, what they &lsquo;did not see&rsquo; could be ignored once the chain of evidence was formed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to the police, Chase Harper's family hoped to settle, but Stella refused to settle at all. She even said that Chase Harper would be put in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If so, he would not even get probation once the case was decided!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt heavyhearted as she thought of Chase Harper's case. She remembered meeting Chase Harper's parents when she went to the detention center. They were a simple old couple. They almost knelt and groveled to her as soon as they saw her, hoping she could keep their son safe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed very hard... to keep him safe now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was almost a lost cause, but she did not want to lose! She knew what it felt like to be unjustly imprisoned, and she did not want someone like Chase Harper to suffer the same thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some thought, Grace decided to go to Stella. After all, she wanted to find out what Stella's motives were in making such a fuss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hospital was naturally the best place to find Stella, for she had been visiting Brian every day since he was hospitalized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, she saw Stella in Brian's room, but Brian was not there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're looking for Brian, he's going through some tests right now and won't be back for a while." Stella smiled at Grace, clearly in a good mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, everything was going according to her plan with Evelyn. How could she be in a bad mood?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've come to see you," said Grace. She walked up to Stella and went straight to the point. "Why set Chase Harper up?"</p></div>
