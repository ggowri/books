        <h1>Chapter 1355</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, Lina would be awake for one to two hours a day. The rest of the time, she would be asleep. It would take some time before she could stay awake longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn came a little earlier than Grace and saw Lina when she was awake through the transparent glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn had always thought that Lina's temper was like hers back then, so when she saw Lina like this, her eyes could not help but redden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had led an unfortunate life. Even if she only had six months left to live, she still hoped Lina could be alive and well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, there was nothing she could do to help Lina with her current illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After visiting Lina, Kyla Corbyn and Grace walked out of the hospital together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, how are you doing? Shall I look for another specialist for you?" asked Grace, feeling concerned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. My condition is stable so far. Besides, the doctor I'm seeing now is an expert in this," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had looked it up previously and found that Kyla Corbyn's doctor was indeed a famous expert in treating liver cancer. "You must tell me if you don't have enough money for treatment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it." Kyla Corbyn smiled. Although her life had been bumpy, she was lucky enough to meet a friend like Grace in the last year of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, how's Nelson? Is he okay? Does he like the toys and clothes I bought him last time?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He likes them very much. He has been playing with the toys you bought him these days. He's also reluctant to wear the new clothes you bought him. He said he'll wear them the next time he goes out to play."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed. She recalled wanting to wear her new clothes every day when she was little, which was the exact opposite of Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll bring him out to play next time to see how he looks in his new clothes," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Kyla Corbyn. Then, she seemed to think of something, and a hint of dejection flashed in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They walked to the hospital&rsquo;s entrance. Grace wanted to see Kyla Corbyn off, but Kyla Corbyn hurriedly said, "No thanks. I still have some errands to run today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take you there, then," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s okay. It's more convenient for me to take the subway!" With that, Kyla Corbyn quickly scurried toward the subway&rsquo;s entrance near the hospital without waiting for Grace to reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After entering the subway station, Kyla Corbyn breathed a sigh of relief and gave a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How should I tell Grace? Am I going to tell her that during a kindergarten activity, Nelson had said that his dream was to go to the amusement park with his daddy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I going to tell her Nelson had painted a picture of a family of three with his parents holding his hands, looking happy and sweet?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One time when she went to pick up Nelson, the kindergarten teacher had implicitly told her that Nelson lacked paternal love and hoped she could talk to Nelson's father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was sensible enough not to show her that he missed his father in front of her. Therefore, she was shocked when she heard about it from his teacher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her son's understanding and kind nature made her sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had always thought that she could be both a mother and a father, providing both maternal and paternal love to the child. However, it turned out it was still impossible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have much more time left, but at least... she wanted to fulfill some of her son's wishes before she died so that she could perhaps die in peace.</p></div>
