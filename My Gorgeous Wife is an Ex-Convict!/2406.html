        <h1>Chapter 2404</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh?" Whitney Herrera raised her eyebrows in surprise. "What&rsquo;s the plot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A story about the return of an heiress. She&rsquo;s involved in a love triangle. In a car accident that took place later on, the second male lead went against human instincts and turned the steering wheel so that he would take the brunt of the impact in order to save the female lead. The second male lead died while the female lead went mad and was admitted to the mental hospital by her family and fianc&eacute;," Brian briefly explained the story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Whitney Herrera&rsquo;s and Grace's expressions changed when they heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera looked at Brian in surprise. "This story..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Someone gave me this script. I read it and thought it might make a good movie, but I overheard someone saying the story is quite similar to what had happened to your husband's eldest brother, Herman Moss, and the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family. Mr. Herman Moss died when he got into a car accident with Amber Mitchell. Amber Mitchell was rescued but became mentally disturbed. She was then sent to a mental hospital, wasn't she?" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera bit her lip, and there was a tint of embarrassment on her face. "Mr. Hart, this story is indeed similar to what happened to my husband's eldest brother and the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family. To be honest, the Moss family has worked hard to suppress the news after the accident. If this is made into a movie, I'm afraid that it&rsquo;ll cause sorrow to my family again, so I hope you could reject this script."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian replied, "We're already in the pre-production stage. We can't just call it quits. Besides, it's still different from what had happened to Mr. Herman Moss and the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family. They were only friends. It's not like they had feelings for each other like in the script. Besides, I can also ask the scriptwriter to modify the second male lead's character so that others won&rsquo;t be reminded of Mr. Herman Moss. Is that okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, Whitney Herrera was still unwilling to make the script into a film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, if you really make this script into a film, I'm afraid it&rsquo;ll hurt not only the Moss family but also the Mitchell and Gregory families," said Whitney Herrera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? However, the female lead doesn't know who she loves in this script. She hurt her fianc&eacute; as well as the second male lead. If they associate the script with the real people involved, they might find the Gregory and Mitchell families unjust after watching the movie. After all, George Gregory married Louise Mitchell shortly after Amber Mitchell was admitted to the mental hospital. Didn't people call him unfaithful after that? In this movie, the fianc&eacute; is portrayed in a positive light!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera was instantly speechless when Brian said this. "But Mr. Hart..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Unless the Moss family has something to hide regarding what had happened back then? Otherwise, I don't think the Moss family should worry about it. After all, Mr. Herman Moss sacrificing himself to save his friend. It&rsquo;s something worthy of respect. There's nothing to hide!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera hesitated a little before hurriedly standing up and saying, "I... need to go to the bathroom. Excuse me." With that said, she and her assistant left the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Brian and Grace were left in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Brian. 'Is the script he said earlier just a coincidence? Or...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You seem to have a lot of doubts," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does the script exist?" she asked.</p></div>
