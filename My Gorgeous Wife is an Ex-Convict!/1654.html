        <h1>Chapter 1652</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked out the window toward the apartment floor Lina was staying on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She's in that apartment right now. What is she doing? Is she still mad that I caused her to be in such a predicament?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Aren't you going upstairs, Mr. Stephenson?" the driver asked somewhat curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I'll just stay here for a while," muttered Hadwin Stephenson. He still maintained the same sitting posture and looked quietly at the apartment floor through the window. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Tomorrow... I can clear Lina's name tomorrow!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next day, news broke out that Katherine Jackson had been dating a mystery man for years. She even kept him as a secret lover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They soon found out his identity. He used to be a male stripper in a nightclub. However, he now lived in a luxurious mansion and had people waiting on him when he went out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The reporter even claimed to have followed Katherine Jackson for several years and had many photos of Katherine Jackson's private meetings with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Some of them were posted online, of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In these photos, Katherine Jackson was seen being intimate with that man, even kissing him passionately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The reporter also said they had something juicier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson was surrounded by reporters when she finally left Hadwin Stephenson's mansion. Looking at the photos they showed her, she instantly understood that this was the &lsquo;show&rsquo; Hadwin Stephenson had mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The news about the male stripper was true. She had indeed been trying to conquer Hadwin Stephenson for five years, but it did not mean that she was ascetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She naturally had needs and would want to see other men kneel at her feet and worship her like a dog!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, these photos were two to three years old! Katherine Jackson did not believe that a reporter had taken these photos as they would have immediately asked her for money upon taking these juicy photos!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson probably gave these photos to the reporter who broke the news!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I can't believe Hadwin Stephenson&hellip; has been so calm this whole time!' Katherine Jackson found the man increasingly unfathomable and frightening. Why did she ever set her eyes on him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Jackson, do you have an explanation for these photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're so intimate with this man while dating Mr. Stephenson. What relationship do you have with this man? Are you cheating on Mr. Stephenson?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What about your engagement to Mr. Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They bombarded Katherine Jackson with a series of questions. She now had a taste of Lina's predicament back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is Hadwin Stephenson trying to give me a taste of my own medicine?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Lina had Hadwin Stephenson to rescue her. No one would help her. She even needed to &lsquo;perform&rsquo; as best she could!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next day, a piece of even more exciting news broke out. The Stephenson family had canceled their engagement with the Jackson family!</p></div>
