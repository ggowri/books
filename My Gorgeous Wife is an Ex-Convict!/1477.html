        <h1>Chapter 1476</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is Jason locking you up?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Lock me up? How did he get that idea?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing her confused face, Brian said, "The number of security guards at Reed Residence has more than tripled these days, and I heard that the security system has been upgraded as well. Besides, I wanted to see you twice, but Jason stopped me both times. I couldn't meet you at all. When I called your phone, the signal was automatically blocked."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was shocked when she heard this. It turned out it was not her illusion that the number of security guards had increased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Speaking of which, Jay had also sent more people to follow her around. On one occasion, she wanted to walk around the neighborhood but the area was cleared out. She was surrounded by a group of bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since then, she never wandered around and only walked around Reed Residence these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, there seemed to be more surveillance in the residence too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is Jay scared... I'd run away? So he 'locked' me up in such a way?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace wondered while Brian said worriedly, "What's going on between you and him? Did he treat you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was afraid that after Grace found out the truth, the relationship between Grace and Jason would become tense and there would be a conflict between them. However, Jason suppressed all information about Grace. He could not even get in touch with her. He could only grab this opportunity to find out about her matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Jay didn't do anything to me. Maybe... it&rsquo;s because I'm about to go into labor, so he's putting in extra security. You don't have to worry about me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" Brian stared at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really," she said, but her heart was doubtful too. 'Jay suddenly strengthened the security and the number of guards was even tripled. Is it just because I'm about to give birth?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Or... is there another reason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'When I said I wanted to take some time apart, was Jay afraid of me leaving and this is what he&rsquo;s doing... to spy on me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian looked down slightly. Whether what she said was true or not, she seemed alright for now. "If Jason is really locking you up and you want to leave in the future, then I..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before he could finish, the door of the consulting room was suddenly pushed open. Jason walked in. "She can't leave, and you can't take her away either!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace and Brian both froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian narrowed his eyes and said suddenly, "You knew I was here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said nonchalantly, "Yes, I knew. I just wanted to find out what you're up to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he could not stay outside any longer when he found out that he was trying to talk Grace into leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Was he afraid that Grace's answer would be something he did not want to hear, so he would rather interrupt in this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian looked at Jason and said, "I hope Grace has the freedom to make her own choice no matter what. If she wants to stay with you, then I'll never interfere. But if you want to lock her up and deny her any freedom, then I'll set her free."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason suddenly sneered, "Who are you to set my wife free?"</p></div>
