        <h1>Chapter 2782</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I forgive you?" Brian asked back nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Rhea Oliver froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hate forgiving others the most. There are few people in this world I can forgive for messing with me." With that said, he indifferently instructed his men, "Pull her away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His men pulled Rhea Oliver aside, and Brian strode to leave with Valda Theller in his arms. He left a group of people behind as they looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver desperately shouted, "Mr. Hart, wait. Forgive me. I'm sorry. I... I can kowtow and apologize to Valda Theller and you. Please don't go. Mr. Hart... Mr. Hart..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian did not stop no matter how Rhea Oliver pleaded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver's behavior made the people who used to taunt and beat Valda Theller shudder. They seemed to have seen their future when they looked at Rhea Oliver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"X-Camille, is Valda Theller really Brian's girlfriend?" someone finally asked, remembering Camille Strickland was here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland sneered and said, "Could it be fake? I told you but you didn't believe me! You&rsquo;d better think it over if any of you wants to hurt Valda. Also, Brian will help Valda to get payback for everything she suffered in university!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said, glancing at Barbara Schuman as if she were hinting at something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's red lips were pressed together tightly. Her expression was utterly ghastly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Damn it. No wonder Valda Theller doesn't care about Raymond Bowman. It's because Valda Theller already has Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Raymond Bowman is nothing compared to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is Valda Theller doing better than me? Valda Theller should be unfortunate and pathetic!' Barbara Schuman's eyes flickered with jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's eyes had also been this jealous when Valda Theller's comic won the competition!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian carried Valda Theller into the car. The face of the person in his arms was red, and her eyes were closed. She looked so pitiful with wet tears on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never been a sympathetic man, yet he could not explain why his heart broke at the sight of the way she looked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because she's my girlfriend? Or... is it because this woman was willing to help me and be my girlfriend when I was most miserable even when she knew nothing about me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian could not tell what he was feeling at the moment. The only thing he was sure of was that he wanted the woman to be okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whatever happened to them in the future, he wanted her to be fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">15 minutes later, the car drove to a hospital's entrance. Brian carried Valda Theller to the emergency room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor looked at the drunk Valda Theller, frowned, and asked, "What's going on? Did she have a lot to drink?" After all, Valda Theller reeked of alcohol right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," said Brian.</p></div>
