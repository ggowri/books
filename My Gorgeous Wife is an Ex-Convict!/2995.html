        <h1>Chapter 2993</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Valda wore a blue casual outfit, while Brian wore a blue shirt paired with white casual pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at them, and they looked like they were wearing matching couple outfits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian drove towards Valda's school while Valda talked about their high school days on the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At that time, my art teacher in our class was very kind to me. Later on, I developed an interest in drawing comics, and it was also his encouragement," Valda said. "At that time, many people only thought that drawing comics was not a serious job, but he encouraged me and said that since I had this talent, I should not easily give it up. While studying, I could also pay attention to comics. At that time, our art teacher had a partnership with a comic training institution outside of school. He talked to them and arranged for me to attend their classes for free."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, in that case, I really have to thank you, teacher," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, I really have to thank him," Valda said. Going back to high school, this teacher was the one she most wanted to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon arriving at the school entrance, Brian was about to park his car when his phone suddenly rang. After answering the call, he furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, he turned to Valda and said, "Valda, I have some urgent matters to attend to at the company. It should take about one or two hours, not too long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You go ahead first, I'll just wander around the school by myself," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll finish up here and come find you later," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian drove away in his car, while Valda walked into the school alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it's the weekend today, the school is unusually crowded due to the anniversary celebration. Banners are hung everywhere and there are student booths scattered throughout the campus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There are classes and clubs, making it exceptionally lively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Apart from some school students, there were also many people who looked like working adults, just like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Most of the visitors here are like her, former students who graduated from this school and have come back to visit during the anniversary celebration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at the things on each booth, most of which were small gadgets made by students. Although some of them were a bit rough, they were quite interesting to look at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was a bit taken aback when passing by a stall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That is the comic book society.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was in school, there was no manga club yet. Although both she and the art teacher wanted to have one, the school's limited resources and funding prevented them from passing the manga club application.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, there is a comic book society that makes Valda feel quite emotional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the comic book club, you'll find things related to comics, such as students' own comic drawings and some comic books for sale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And among them, Valda saw her own comic book.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you like to buy some comic books?" A girl greeted Valda warmly and picked up a comic book from the shelf. "This comic book was drawn by one of our senior members in the comic society. She's really talented, you know. She has many published comic books, and some of them have even been adapted into TV dramas."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The girl was boasting about how her favorite manga artist was the shining star of the manga club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda, the original being who was being praised by her, couldn't help but chuckle at being called "senior?"</p></div>
