        <h1>Chapter 3893</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the three, Mason was the groom. Although he usually had a habit of being expressionless, his lips would occasionally curl up into a smile from the bottom of his heart on this occasion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was the best groomsman, with a polite smile on his face that was obviously more friendly than the Reed brothers, making him look gentle and likable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Mick, although he was not as cold and indifferent as his younger brother, he was not someone who smiled often. Now, because he had been maintaining a smile, he felt like his mouth was almost cramping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the reception of guests finally came to an end, William patted Mick's shoulder and said, "Your smile looks so stiff."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You noticed?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ask anyone, they can tell," William replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I feel like getting married is really exhausting. If every wedding is like this, I'd rather not get married," Mick said, rubbing his sore jaw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is the only time in your life, or do you think you'll get married more than once?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William smiled and said, "Don't let Uncle Reed and Auntie Grace hear you say that. They'll worry if they know you have this attitude towards marriage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is marriage really that great?" Mick asked. He used to think that marriage was a distant concept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when Mason was getting married, he realized that they were already at the age to get married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And in another two or three years, Jasper would also marry William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course it's great. Being with the person you love every day, isn't that great?" William said. "I thought you would have a lot of longing for marriage when you see how loving your parents are to each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Longing?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick raised his eyebrows. He didn't really have much longing for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although his parents were loving and his siblings were harmonious, he didn't seem to have much interest in this area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was interested in many things, such as computer science, linguistics, business, and management... Learning seemed to be a simple thing for him, and he could even teach himself many things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People around him always liked to describe him as a genius.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he still remembered when he was a child, he pretended to be asleep with his eyes closed, but he heard his mother and father talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, his mother said, "I actually hope that Mick isn't such a genius. Once someone is a genius in one aspect, they may be lacking in other aspects."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lacking? What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"...Actually, everyone thinks that compared to Mason, Mick is a child who lacks emotions, is indifferent and cold, not easy to approach, but... that's just how it looks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you think Mick actually lacks emotions more than Mason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you? Don't you feel that way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It doesn't matter. Whether he lacks emotions or not, he is my son. Even if he never falls in love with anyone in his life, as long as he feels comfortable, it's okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But in that case, he may miss out on a lot of happiness in his life. I'm afraid the five years we were apart may have had an impact on him... After all, from birth to the age of five is a critical period for a child's personality and psychological development..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After his parents left, he opened his eyes.</p></div>
