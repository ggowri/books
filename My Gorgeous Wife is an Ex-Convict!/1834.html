        <h1>Chapter 1832</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Didn't you ask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina didn't want to talk about it, so I didn't pursue it." Grace pondered for a moment and said, "Jay, can you find Hadwin Stephenson? I want to see Hadwin Stephenson and ask him what happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You care so much about Lina," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She's my best friend." Without Lina, she would not be here right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What about me? Do you care more about her or me?" asked Jason as he suddenly leaned over and put his face right in front of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Those bright peach blossom eyes stared at her intensely. They were amorous and full of longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though he knew how much Lina meant to her, he still could not help wanting her to care more about him. He wanted all her attention. If he could not get all of it, then... he at least hoped he could get the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was greedy, but only for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said, "You can't be jealous of this too, right? You&rsquo;re my husband while Lina is my friend. There's no comparison!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I'm even jealous of this. It's silly, isn't it?" His lashes fluttered slightly as he slowly looked down. His long fingers helped her fasten her seat belt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What he said made her heart ache a little. Just as he was about to withdraw his hand, her hand suddenly caught his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a few days of recovery, she was able to grasp things now, but not too hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now, she was holding his hand as hard as she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter?" He looked up at her with some confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're not silly. Why would my Jay be silly? It's just because you love me so much." She said as she looked at him sternly, "Jay, Lina is the most important friend in my life. If she's in trouble, I'll try everything possible to help her, but you... are the man I&rsquo;ll share my life with. I won&rsquo;t hesitate to trade my life for yours!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was stunned. His dark eyes stared straight at her. He did not even notice the tears falling from his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His heart was beating wildly, and his blood seemed to boil. He had just heard the most beautiful voice telling him how much she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, why are you crying? Don't cry! I... I didn't say all these to make you cry," Grace said in a panic as she fumbled to get a tissue and wiped away his tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, he instantly held her in his arms. "Grace, just love me like this forever, okay?" He wanted her to love him. He wanted her to love him very much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His scent enveloped her, and she leaned against his chest to feel his warmth. Then, she raised her hands, hugged him back as hard as she could, and answered, "Okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason had no problem finding Hadwin Stephenson, but the results surprised Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The airport... Hadwin Stephenson was now in Emerald City's airport, ready to leave Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson's leaving? That's too soon!" Grace said in disbelief. Then, she said to Jason, "I want to go to the airport. I want to see Hadwin Stephenson and ask for clarification! I have to do it no matter what!"</p></div>
