        <h1>Chapter 2703</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Patrick, who was in front of her. He was nothing like the ruthless man he was in front of Queenie Mack earlier. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks." Valda Theller shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick wanted to say something else, but Brian frowned and said, "That's enough. If Valda is upset, I&rsquo;ll help her vent her anger. There's no need for you to meddle in this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're right." Patrick smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Valda Theller's face and said, "It's getting late. I'll send Valda home first. You guys can go on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick smiled and did not ask them to stay. "Okay, we'll get together again next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Brian bade goodbye to the others before taking Valda Theller out of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't look well. Were you shocked?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Shock? I was a little shocked, I guess.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated and said, "Do you guys usually treat your escorts so... bluntly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought about it and used the word &lsquo;blunt&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you mean Patrick's attitude toward Queenie Mack?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded. After all, the other people around them did not seem surprised, so it was probably not the first time it had happened. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess so. They're only taking what they need from each other. Most women understand the rules of the game, but some have other ideas," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? Have you ever experienced it?" Valda Theller regretted it as soon as she spoke. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm not his real girlfriend. Why did I ask? Besides, he probably won't answer such a question.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to Valda Theller's surprise, Brian answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze, not knowing what to do. After a long pause, she muttered, "So, did they mean your former escort when they said you could be indifferent even if someone was jumping off a building in front of you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Yeah, she told me she refused to break up and wanted to jump off a building. She told me that she love me with all her life and that she was as good as dead if she couldn't be with me. Hence, she wanted to jump off a building in front of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What happened after that?" she could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"After that?" He smiled faintly. "I told her that she should jump if she meant it. I'd pay her funeral expenses if she did. If she didn't want to jump, she should just leave me alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Valda Theller paused. She asked after a long while, "She... didn't jump?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she didn't." He sneered. "So much for loving me with all her life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said as those phoenix eyes looked up at her somewhat dazed face. "Will you think I'm too heartless?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller did not know how to comment on Brian's character. Judging from what he just said, he was indeed heartless, but... she knew he loved a woman deeply. He waseven willing to sacrifice everything for that woman.</p></div>
