        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Grace. According to the information she collected, Chase Harper's car and Baldwin's car were driving one behind the other at the time of the accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could say that Chase Harper was the first witness when the accident happened!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could ask Chase Harper if she wanted to learn more about the details of the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Want to join me for dinner? It's almost time anyway," said Chase Harper after looking at the time. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks." Grace declined with a smile, clearly keeping her distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know if Chase Harper was still interested in her, but... she did not want to send out the wrong signal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's something else I wish to tell you in regards to this case. I was thinking of having dinner with you and telling you about it as we eat. It won&rsquo;t take much time," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated. "Then&hellip; let's go Dutch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," answered Chase Harper with a shy smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she would have dinner with him, he was elated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina came to see Grace afterward, but she did not expect to see her friend getting out of a car that was being driven by a man at the neighborhood where Grace's rental house was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only saw her best friend saying something to the man with a smile. Then, she waved goodbye before the car drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Um... Is there something going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina quickly ran to Grace's side. "Grace, who&rsquo;s that guy just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback by Lina's sudden appearance. "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to see you. Tell me, who&rsquo;s the man who sent you back? You guys look close." Lina looked like her passion for gossip was ignited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled helplessly and said, "He&rsquo;s my former colleague from the Sanitation Service Center, but he's now left the Sanitation Service Center and is a shareholder of a car dealership. There was a case today, and the victim happens to be a colleague of his at his car dealership. He&rsquo;s also a witness, so we had dinner together and he drove me home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's all?" Lina was disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What were you thinking?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought you had someone you could consider dating," grumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed. "Lina, I'll never date again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina suddenly stopped and looked at her friend in surprise. "You&rsquo;ve only failed once. You don't have to&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not once, but twice." Grace corrected. "It doesn't feel good to be kicked away so easily every time. I don't want to go through that suffering again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt sorry for her best friend. "Maybe the third time's the charm? Maybe you'll meet someone who deserves your love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Instead of spending my time on relationships, I'd rather spend my time on what I really want to spend on. Perhaps I'm just not suited for love. Besides, you know that my body makes it hard for me to conceive. How many men in this world would like to have no children of their own?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina threw her arms around Grace. "You mustn't talk about yourself like that. Nothing is absolute. People who really like you and love you will be tolerant of these things. Besides... My child will be your child. Our child will have two mothers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina choked up while talking. 'I don't like Grace saying such things. It feels as if she&rsquo;s done with her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But she&rsquo;s still so young. She's only 28!'</p></div>
