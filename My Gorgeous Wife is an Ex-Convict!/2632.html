        <h1>Chapter 2630</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought she was only a tool. After all, she was not the one he had fallen in love with at the time. He was only using her to complete a bet with another woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he saw her taunted at school and even humiliated in public, he felt a painful pang in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A person who had once been cheerful in front of him had become tremblingly fearful of her surroundings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew she was being bullied and became the laughing stock of the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He caused all this. It happened to her because he used her. However, he still did not explain anything at school even when he saw her so miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hurried abroad as an exchange student half a year later as if to escape all this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the scenes of her being bullied by others still appeared in his mind from time to time even after going abroad. She had imperceptibly held a place in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would wonder how she was doing and whether she was alright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It never occurred to him that the woman he did not care about but only wanted to use could not be erased from his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when other women were friendly to him, deliberately approached him, and made intimate gestures, her face would recur to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not get rid of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, have you ever thought you might have fallen in love with Valda Theller?" His former university classmate and current best friend Chang Mingyu had said to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I've fallen in love with her?' He found it ridiculous as soon as he heard it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I have fallen in love with Valda Theller? That woman has never been my cup of tea. Besides, I was attracted to another woman at first.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How is that possible? Stop joking around!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How else would you explain it? Why do you still think of her after all these years? Is it really because you feel guilty? If so, you have a lot of people to feel guilty about. Since childhood, many women have been rejected by you. Why don't you feel guilty about them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he found out about her whereabouts, secretly investigated her current situation, and asked Keith Sharp to take him on the blind date.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only wanted to take this opportunity to reconnect with her, but he did not expect her to have a boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have a boyfriend when he investigated her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Where did this boyfriend of hers come from? And she's in love with him? I was the one she loved!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought of this sent another pang of pain through his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought she would hate him, try to avoid him, or rush up and beat him when they met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never thought she would not hate him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not hate him because she had no feelings for him anymore! Her love for him was gone, but he...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If there was karma in this world, perhaps this would be it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
