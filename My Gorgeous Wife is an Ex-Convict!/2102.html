        <h1>Chapter 2100</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if he had given up everything as the dagger cut again and he had another wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was more and more blood on his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla became more and more frightened. As he was about to cut himself again, she rushed forward and grabbed his hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, stop hurting yourself!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyelashes fluttered as he looked up at her. "You don't want me to die, do you? Kyla, you still have feelings for me, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together. "Even if I have no feelings for you, I'm not heartless enough to see you bleed to death!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She carefully removed the dagger from his hand as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, he did not insist on holding on to the dagger. Everything went well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was still bleeding as he grew increasingly paler. He would bleed out if it went on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said promptly, "You need to stop the bleeding now. I'll get you to the hospital! Where is your medical kit? Is there any gauze or cotton?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, before she could finish, he suddenly hugged her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was shocked. "Martin Weiss, let go. You&rsquo;re wounded right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he held her so hard that the smell of blood rushed into her mouth and nose as if it enveloped her whole being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Will you... give birth to the baby?" He was still clinging to the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her body trembled. Just as she had no idea how to answer, someone suddenly opened the door. Grace, Jason, and several bodyguards barged in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was startled when she saw what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's going on? Kyla, you and Martin Weiss..." Grace asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He's bleeding a lot because he cut himself with a dagger. We have to dress the wounds immediately and take him to the hospital," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace hurriedly had someone separate Kyla from Martin Weiss and asked them to treat Martin Weiss's wounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, while they treated his wounds, Martin Weiss kept holding Kyla's hand. Even when he was about to be sent to the hospital and was getting into the car, Martin Weiss still held Kyla's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla could not shake Martin Weiss's hand off, so she could only get into the car Martin Weiss was in and go to the hospital with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Jason got in another car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace muttered, "It's a good thing Kyla didn't get hurt. What the hell is going on with Martin Weiss? How could he hurt himself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When they first barged in, she almost thought Martin Weiss had hurt Kyla!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to hurt Kyla, so he could only hurt himself," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's too extreme. If Kyla remained indifferent and if we hadn't come, he would have died!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He was gambling on whether Kyla would be indifferent toward him or not," Jason said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But the stakes are too high. He's risking his life!" Grace said with a frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's because it doesn't matter to him if he does lose," said Jason.</p></div>
