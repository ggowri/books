        <h1>Chapter 2688</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But what motive could the crown prince Brian have for Valda? Money? Body? People would probably laugh if I told them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian even gave Valda the right to break up with him. It can only mean that... Brian has feelings for Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And Valda...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman smiled bitterly at the thought of it. It must be easy for Valda to fall in love with a man like Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What about me? Have I lost Valda?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman who used to blush for hours at the slightest touch of his finger on her cheek would no longer blush for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the ward, Camille Strickland was still staring at Brian, unable to pull out of her trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really... the crown prince?" Camille Strickland asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The crown prince?" Brian smiled. "It's just a nickname from others. You don't need to call me that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, thank you for sending someone to save Valda. Otherwise, Valda would&rsquo;ve been in so much trouble." Camille Strickland was still terrified when she recalled what happened at the time. "Queenie Mack is so mean. Though she was sent to the police station, she&rsquo;ll probably be released on Stephensonl soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She can't get out on Stephensonl," Brian said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No way. Queenie Mack has a backer and should be able to get out easily," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said she can't get out on Stephensonl, so she can't," Brian said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland's eyes lit up suddenly. 'Yes, so what if Queenie Mack has a backer? Valda has a backer like Brian too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Queenie Mack is in trouble this time.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I won't disturb you two. I'll go home first. Please take care of Valda, Mr. Hart." Camille Strickland left the ward in a good mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Valda Theller and Brian were left in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want to happen to Queenie Mack?" Brian asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Valda Theller froze, unable to come to her senses all of a sudden. "I don't understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jail time? Or do you want to have her fall from grace? Should we let her go through what you went through today? What about letting her suffer the pain you suffered tenfold or a hundredfold? What do you think?" Brian said casually as if he were talking about something simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could not help gulping. 'Is he trying to stand up... for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Let the police handle her. Just do it according to the law," Valda Theller said weakly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Why did you do all this for me?" Valda Theller could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes glanced at her bruised face and swollen cheek. Her round deerlike eyes were full of confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you're my girlfriend. Someone laid a hand on my girlfriend. Of course, I'm going to get justice for you," he said.</p></div>
