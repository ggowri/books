        <h1>Chapter 3720</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our relationship is different now than it was before. You don't need to apologize for just moving my bangs," he said, taking her hand and using her fingers to gently push aside the hair on his forehead. "Our relationship has changed, hasn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of relationship do we have now?" she couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they had agreed to "try things out," she wasn't sure what that meant for their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of relationship do you want?" Mason asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica hesitated. Were they still just brother and sister? She had hoped they could maintain that kind of relationship as they grew older, but it seemed impossible now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're... trying to see if we can have a romantic relationship, but it's not really dating, is it?" she said, feeling like they were testing the waters before committing to anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like some people who tried living together before getting married, just to make sure they were compatible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Testing the waters?" Mason's gaze flickered over her face, as if he was deep in thought. After a moment, he said, "That's a good way to put it. We're testing the waters. What did you do in your past relationships?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face turned red and white as she struggled to come up with an answer. She had only dated Daniel once, and that had caused a rift between her and Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, that was also a past she didn't want to recall. And now, he was asking her what they would do if they were in a relationship? Was he asking her what she and Daniel did when they were together?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why aren't you saying anything?" He asked again, as her silence had gone on for too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's...nothing. Just normal things that people do when they're dating," she replied vaguely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he kept pressing, "What kind of normal things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just...like that," she ran out of words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like what?" He continued to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt her cheeks getting hotter and hotter, the embarrassment becoming more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something you can't say?" He asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pursed her lips and took a deep breath, "When I was dating Daniel, we went out to eat, watched movies, did homework at the library, bought books at the bookstore...you should know all of this. Do I really have to tell you every detail?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her, and he did remember all of those things she mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like watching a movie that someone else was acting in. He knew, but it didn't really affect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about after Daniel?" He asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one," she said, "After breaking up with Daniel, I never dated anyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?" His gaze seemed to pierce through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I didn't meet anyone I liked," she said, feeling like she had lost that feeling since they broke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, when seeing those handsome idol male stars, many young girls would have some admiration and fantasies. Even the younger version of themselves would hope for a sweet romance and couldn't help but envy others' happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after breaking up with him, those feelings seemed to disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she works at a talent agency and has met many celebrities, some of whom are popular among fans and have good looks. But she doesn't feel anything towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when watching romantic dramas, she doesn't have any daydreams or feelings of fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She often feels that although her body is still young, her heart seems to have aged and lost all fantasies about love, as if she were already in her seventies or eighties.</span></p></div>
