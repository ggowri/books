        <h1>Chapter 1116</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace planned to continue hiding the truth from Brian, so she could not even tell the truth if she wanted to!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled faintly. Just then, Lina's WeChat notifications rang. It was a WeChat message from Hadwin Stephenson. Lina took a look, and it was Hadwin Stephenson asking when she was going over to his place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace accidentally caught a glimpse and said, "Alright, Hadwin Stephenson is waiting for you. Go to his place first. Let's get together again sometime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright then. Remember to call me if you need anything. Don't suffer on your own," Lina said a little worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it!" Grace smiled. Only when she was with Lina could she relax and show her true self.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that Lina would stand by her no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina left Grace's place, her heart suddenly became a little heavy. She did not know whether this was good for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She broke up with Jason only to be faced with Brian now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace did not love Brian and did not want to accept him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that in relationships, being able to share mutual affections and trust was some sort of luck and blessing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina also felt luckier and luckier. Although there were some twists and turns with Hadwin Stephenson at the beginning, it was still smooth sailing after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She drove to Hadwin Stephenson's mansion. Once she walked in, she saw Hadwin Stephenson talking to someone on the phone. His expression was serious, and a solemn look flashed across his face while he was on the phone. It was something she had never seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when his eyes saw her coming in, they instantly turned into a familiar gentleness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's heart warmed. She put down her bag and sat on the couch nearby. Then, she held her chin and silently watched Hadwin Stephenson talking on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Hadwin Stephenson did not turn on the speakerphone, Lina could tell to some extent that Hadwin Stephenson was talking to the &lsquo;first wife&rsquo; of the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was because Hadwin Stephenson referred to the caller as &lsquo;Mother&rsquo;. Even though he was talking to the other end of the line in his usual tone and sounded gentle, at the same time, something cold still flashed across his face occasionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call was over, Hadwin Stephenson put away his phone and looked at Lina. "How did it go with Grace? Is she alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She looks okay, but actually..." Lina sighed. "I don't know if Grace is really okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her hand and embraced Hadwin Stephenson as she spoke. She buried her face deep into his arms. "I think my relationship is going smoother than Grace&rsquo;s. I'm so lucky to have met you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson lowered his head and looked at the person in his arms. "I'm the lucky one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, "Let's just say we're both lucky. By the way, were you on the phone with the Stephenson family's first wife just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was the conversation unpleasant?" she asked curiously.</p></div>
