        <h1>Chapter 2433</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of Grace retching came from the washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Has she been unwell lately?" Brian asked Jason in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned. "I'm not sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not sure? Aren't you her husband? Why don&rsquo;t you know if she hasn&rsquo;t been feeling well?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes darkened, and he said coldly, "Who are you to ask me that? Just like what you said, I'm her husband. I'll take care of her. Don't say things you shouldn't say!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression stiffened suddenly. 'Yeah, who am I?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not even know if Grace still regarded him as a friend or if he was someone she wanted to avoid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I don't care why you're helping Grace, but you'd better remember that Grace will forever be my wife. Don't ever have any ideas you shouldn't have. I'm the only one she loves!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cold warning made Brian's face pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could not argue because he did not have the right to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace loved Jason, not him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace walked out of the washroom. As soon as she came out, she saw Jason and Brian standing opposite each other. Jason looked solemn, while Brian looked pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's... going on?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing." Jason smiled, stepped forward to help Grace, and said, "What came over you? Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I'm a little uncomfortable, but I feel better after throwing up. Maybe I ate too little at noon and got too hungry. My stomach probably got a little upset because I suddenly ate," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll order you some porridge later. It'll be easy to digest and warm your stomach," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Grace said with a nod and glanced at Brian's pale face. "Are you two okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s fine. We were just chatting a little. Right, Brian?" Jason said to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes fell on Grace's almond-shaped eyes that were filled with concern. 'Is her concern partly due to me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, we were just making small talk," replied Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in the private room, Mick Reed came to Grace's side. There was obvious worry in his peach blossom eyes that were similar to Jason's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine. My stomach's just a little upset, so I went to the washroom to throw up," Grace said as she patted her son's small head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one frowned, recalling when his stomach was upset in the past. "Mommy, are you okay now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm okay now," said Grace as she smiled at the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed seemed slightly relieved but still anxiously watched Grace finish the bowl of porridge before the expression on his face finally stopped being so tense.</p></div>
