        <h1>Chapter 1510</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Little Young Master was the exception!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps Little Young Master was the only one who Young master Reed cared about. However, the interaction between them was always very cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The thought of it made Terrence sigh to himself again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If Grace were still alive and Young master Reed hadn&rsquo;t forgotten about their relationship, I think he would&rsquo;ve treated Little Young Master like a treasure and pampered him. He might even behave like any ordinary father who loved his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He wouldn&rsquo;t be so cold like how he currently is.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Unfortunately, everything would not go according to plans. It was only because Young master Reed had forgotten about the love he had for Grace that he was able to continue living!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was also because of this he was able to witness Little Young Master slowly grow up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Back then, your feelings for Young Madam&hellip; You were indeed in love with her," Terrence answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Love?" Jason sneered. Even when the people around him told him about his relationship with Grace back then, he merely felt as though he was listening to a story. Despite him being the protagonist of the story, he still felt like he was an outsider.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was like no matter what was being said, it had nothing to do with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If I had really fallen in love, I wouldn't have so easily forgotten about the love story between us. Since I've forgotten about it, it only proves that I was never deeply in love with her," said Jason coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence held his breath. He could not bring himself to tell Young master Reed about it. In reality, it was because of Secretary Wang&rsquo;s trick that caused him to forget about Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Currently, Young master Reed was not at all concerned about his past relationship with Grace. This was the best thing they could all hope for. After all, if Young master Reed suddenly remembered again, perhaps he would fall into despair once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He drove the car to Reed Residence. The butler stepped out to greet Jason who just got down from the car. He said, "Miss Lynch and Young Lady have been waiting for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch was the girl Jason adopted. However, the official process could not be carried out because her biological mother was still alive. However, the Reed family had already revealed it to the public. Hence, in everyone's opinion, even if they could not proceed with the adoption process, she was still deemed as the adopted daughter of the Reed family. Hence, the butler would greet her as &lsquo;Young Lady&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, for Oriel Lynch's biological mother, Irene Lynch, she was just a young and unmarried mother. The butler could only greet her as Miss Lynch. After all, greeting her as Miss Lynch would be more inappropriate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason frowned and walked into the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the hall, Irene Lynch's eyes suddenly sparkled when she saw Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back then, she would not have thought that she would have such a fate with the man holding the most authority in Emerald City. Her daughter had caught Jason's attention and became his adopted daughter. She was also able to get closer to Jason without using any underhanded means.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Initially, she was just a woman who got pregnant before getting married. She was also ditched by another man and became a humiliation to the family. However, she had become someone whom everyone admired now. Those relatives who used to look down on her were now trying their hardest to curry favor with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Naturally, she knew that all this was only happening because of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It&rsquo;s just that my daughter has become an adopted daughter&hellip; I still lack that one step. After all, there&rsquo;ll be a day when Jason will marry as well. When the time comes, I'm afraid that with my daughter having the status of an adopted daughter, things will become awkward for her. If Jason has a biological daughter in the future, then no one will care about the adopted daughter of the Reed family anymore.'</p></div>
