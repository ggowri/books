        <h1>Chapter 1975</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Rosalind Bush was surprised when she heard that her former stepson was going to be in the first grade. "Well... Is Mason going to be in the first grade? Why don't you just transfer Veronica to another school? Emerald City's Foreign Language Primary School is a great primary school..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Rosalind Bush began to ramble on about Veronica Barlow and Mason studying in Foreign Language Primary School. Then, her son could study there too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"When the time comes, we'll just move somewhere near Foreign Language Primary School so it's convenient for the kids to get to and fro from school. We'll be able to take better care of them too. Don't you think so, Mrs. Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at Rosalind Bush with a half-smile. She knew what she was up to. Foreign Language Primary School was an aristocratic primary school in Emerald City, where many rich and powerful families sent their children to study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With tuition fees running at hundreds of thousands of yuan a year and houses in the neighborhood being ridiculously expensive, Rosalind Bush wanted the Reed family to pay for it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's not impossible. How about this? I can pay for Veronica and Mason's tuition fees. But moving to a place near Foreign Language Primary School isn't cheap. You need to make sure that you can afford to buy or rent a house nearby," said Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Rosalind Bush's expectant look suddenly turned pale as if she had eaten something nasty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace lowered her head and said to Mason, "Okay, I've done what I promised you. What about what you promised me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you promise I can video call Sis every day?" the little one asked sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "I promise, and Veronica also has my phone number, so she can call me whenever she wants to reach you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason extended his hand to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace held Mason's hand as they prepared to leave the He family&rsquo;s house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Rosalind Bush instantly panicked at the sight of this. "Hey, where are you taking Mason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Can't I take my son and leave?" Grace asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But... But..." Rosalind Bush panicked. It took her a while to come up with a reason. "Veronica will be worried if she doesn't see Mason when she comes back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, having Mason in the He family was equivalent to the He family being associated with the Reed family. Besides, the Reed family had been paying them money every month to take care of Mason as he was staying with them. It was a lot more money than their salaries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll tell Veronica about it," said Grace as she ignored Rosalind Bush, who was stomping in panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace returned to the Reed family&rsquo;s house with Mason. Mick Reed and Jasper were already there waiting. Grace had also packed Mason's luggage last night and was ordering the servants to load them into the MPV.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Madam, are you sure we don't need to tell Young master Reed?" the butler Uncle Kwan asked in worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, just tell him I'm taking the kids on a trip if he asks," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Uncle Kwan responded in acknowledgment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, Grace and her three children got into the MPV. It slowly drove away from Reed Residence.</p></div>
