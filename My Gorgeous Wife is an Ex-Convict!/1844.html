        <h1>Chapter 1842</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay!" replied Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once she got back to her desk, Lina dealt with the projects at hand and handed over what she ought to hand over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">By afternoon, everyone knew about her pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Many nosy colleagues wondered who the father of her baby was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, is the baby in your belly Hadwin Stephenson's?" Some colleagues surmised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Another group of colleagues instantly rushed over. "Wow, is Lina going to marry into a rich family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina is going to be a young madam!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Wow, I'm so envious of her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before Lina got to say anything, someone poured cold water over her with their words. "Oh, some people just want to get to the top through their baby. If it were so easy to marry into rich families, those rich families would have long been overcrowded."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know, right? I heard that Hadwin Stephenson left Emerald City a few days ago. If he wanted to marry Lina, he would have brought Lina with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, let's hope it's not all for nothing. Rich and powerful families have no lack of children. As long as they're rich, many women are willing to bear children for them. However, there aren't many who get to join them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, rich and powerful families look at family backgrounds when finding someone to marry! Does she think she can do anything she wants now that Hadwin Stephenson has broken up with the heiress of the Jackson family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was no shortage of cynicism in these remarks. Lina glanced indifferently at the colleagues around her and did not care about their comments. Since she planned to have a baby out of wedlock, these gossips and cynicism were inevitable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had already mentally prepared herself, so she just continued handing over her work. Once she was done, she packed up her things and went to human resources to go through the procedures for her sabbatical leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once Lina got out of the design office, she took a long breath and looked down at her flat belly. "Be good and stay in my belly for ten months!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She hailed a taxi and headed to the community health center to get her progesterone shots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she watched the flashing street scene outside the car, she recalled Hadwin Stephenson's face. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Has Hadwin Stephenson... left Emerald City? He won't have anything to do with me anymore, just like I wanted. Are we really strangers from now on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina smiled wryly, telling herself to stop thinking about Hadwin Stephenson. Since she had said in front of Hadwin Stephenson that she would not regret it, then there was no point thinking about that man now. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The taxi stopped at the entrance of the community health center. Lina got off and walked inside. She did not notice there was a car parked not far away. The person in the car was looking at her coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Miss Jackson, we've looked it up. Lina comes to this community health center every day for her progesterone shots, which were prescribed by Municipal Women's Hospital. She has to get these shots regularly for the long-term,&rdquo; the man in the front of the car said to Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What about Hadwin Stephenson? He has gone back to J City. How is he doing?" asked Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Everything is as usual after Mr. Stephenson returned to J City, but he has attended two parties held by J City's socialites. It seemed to be of Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s own volition," the subordinate replied.</p></div>
