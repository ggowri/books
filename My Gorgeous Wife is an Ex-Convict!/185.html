        <h1>Chapter 184</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark eyes stared only at her. Grace who was drunk looked so delicate and alluring. &lsquo;How many people have seen this side of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Has Sean Stevens seen it before?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A sudden wave of jealousy rose in his heart. He was jealous that Sean Stevens had dated her before. While she was dating Sean Stevens, had she ever used such a gentle tone to call out his name? How intimate were they while they were dating?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Are you being truthful that I&rsquo;m good-looking?&rdquo; he murmured back. He had the urge to keep her by his side and not allow anyone else to see such an attractive side of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yup. Very much. Jason is the most handsome man I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo; She smiled as her fingers playfully tapped on the tip of his nose as if he was an interesting toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps, she was the only one who could treat him like a toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her expression changed. Her smile faded and was replaced with sadness. &ldquo;Jason, I&rsquo;ll treat you very well. Please don&rsquo;t leave me, okay?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her almond eyes looked misty. It seemed that he was a very important existence to her, and if he left, that would be a burden she could not bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I never wanted to leave you. You were the one who did not want to stay by my side. Have you forgotten?&rdquo; He knew that she was drunk at the moment and probably would not recall what she said now tomorrow, but he could not stop himself from conversing with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She cocked her head trying to ponder. &ldquo;Why... Why didn&rsquo;t I want to stay by Jay&rsquo;s side? I want to stay by Jay&rsquo;s side... I so badly want to...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he would only get to hear such words when she was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fingers traveled from the tip of his nose to his lips and tapped on them. It was as if she had found a new piece of land as her face inched closer to his lips. She stuck out her tongue and lightly licked his lips once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body stiffened as his gaze darkened. &ldquo;Do you realize what you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she did not know what she was doing. She merely smiled at him, looking elated as if she had just tasted something sweet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason felt his body heating up. Usually, he would never have any physical reactions when faced with women who did more intimate movements when trying to seduce him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yet a simple action from her had evoked a response that he could hardly control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, she ignored him and lowered her head once again. Their lips came in light contact as the tip of her tongue licked over his lips again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sweet...&rdquo; she slurred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, she was like an innocent child, unlike her usual repressed self after coming out from prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He quickly closed his eyes as his hands unknowingly curled into fists. He was trying his best to control his urge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You think that I won&rsquo;t do anything to you no matter what you do to me, is that it?&rdquo; his gruff voice said, but he was not sure if he meant that for her or himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked her almond eyes as if she did not understand what he said. It was followed by a look of consideration. After some time, she smiled suddenly and pressed her lips on his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so sweet. Jason, have a taste of this...&rdquo; she said and kissed him just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened his body and passively received this kiss from her. He was inevitably drowning in such sweetness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her lips parted from his lips, he felt a sudden loss and wanted more.</p></div>
