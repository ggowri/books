        <h1>Chapter 1205</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Mr. Sweeney said to Grace, "Lina is in bad shape. As you can see, our family is in a mess now. We're already in a bad mood, and we hope that you won't show up in front of us. Although we know what happened to Lina this time has nothing to do with you, we're reminded of how much Lina gave up for you when we see you, so we'll always bear a grudge against you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I understand that," said Grace. She had never blamed Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney. Any parent would not like to see their child sacrifice their promising future for a friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a nurse came over and handed a bill to Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney. "We've deducted the deposit from before. You still owe some money, so you should pay up as soon as possible. Lina still has two more surgeries to go. And with the cost of the ICU ward and the subsequent costs, family members better prepare... more than a million dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That knocked Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney out of their wits. More than a million dollars? How could an ordinary family like them have so much money?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That... That much money?" Mr. Sweeney asked with a quiver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That depends. You need to ask the doctor about the details, but more than a million dollars is only the minimum you need. It&rsquo;s possible the treatment will cost more money later,&rdquo; the nurse said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the nurse left, Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney looked miserable as they held the bill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do we do? The money..." Mrs. Sweeney said helplessly. The couple's savings were down to a little more than 100,000 dollars, which was just a drop in the ocean to save their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if they failed to pay up, the hospital would only give their daughter basic treatment and stop her medicine. They would only keep her alive. If that was the case, how long could their daughter stay alive? Perhaps even if she could stay alive, she would only be a living dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney furrowed his brows. After a long time, he seemed to have made up his mind. "If there's no other way, let's sell the house. We can sell the house for more than a million dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... What if it's still not enough? Didn't the nurse say they have no idea how long she has to stay in the ICU ward? And the recovery treatment fees later on..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We don't have much of a choice. Our daughter's life is what matters the most. If we run out of money afterward, I'll find a way to cure my daughter even if I have to beg for food on my knees. Besides, we have Hadwin. When Hadwin shows up, he'll surely find a way to save Lina!" said Mr. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Hadwin's missing. No one knows what happened to him. Could he already..." Mrs. Sweeney sobbed, not daring to think about it any further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as if a knife had pierced her heart as she listened to what they just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sell their house? She knew Lina's parents had only one house. Where was the elderly couple going to stay if they sold it? Rent a house? Lina would then wake up only to find her home gone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uncle and Aunt, I... I'll find a way to raise the money for Lina's medical bills," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney did not believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Sweeney even said, "What are you talking about? What money can you raise? Go away. Don't bother our family again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath and cast another deep glance at her best friend lying on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina, you must hold on and wait for me to raise the money for your medical bills. I must make Lina survive and recover no matter what!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurried out of the hospital. Now, the only person she could think of who could come up with such a large sum of money at once was Brian.</p></div>
