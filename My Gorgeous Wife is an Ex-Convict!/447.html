        <h1>Chapter 446</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked. Then, a blush came over her face. "I... I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was suddenly at a loss. It was as if answering with either yes or no would both be wrong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't say no!" Jason bossily put his hand around Grace's waist and said to her, "If I do have children, it will only be with Sis, so... If you want to be a mother, you can only be the mother of my children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face grew redder. "This is the hospital." There were still people moving back and forth where they were, and there were already people looking this way as he put his arms around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what?" His lips pressed close to her ears. He was breathing down her ears and neck. "Do you understand what I just said, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body could not help but tremble. His voice and breath seemed like a spell, enchanting her into nodding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting into the car, Grace's face was still red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was driving, and she could not help but glance at him from the passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From her point of view, she could see his side profile&mdash;sharp outlines, deep eyes, and a tall, straight nose that made his face look much more defined than the ordinary Asian. His features, the lines of his jaw, and the lines of his neck all seemed exquisite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they had children, what would they look like? The thought instantly filled her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like looking at me that much?" Jason's voice suddenly rang in Grace's ear, interrupting her trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" She suddenly realized that she had been staring at him in a daze. Grace was embarrassed and at a loss when her phone suddenly rang. Grace immediately picked up her phone. The caller ID showed that it was a call from her best friend, Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed the answer button, and Lina's voice sounded from the other end of the phone. "Is it convenient for you to talk now, Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, sure," answered Grace immediately. She would also like to thank Lina for calling and saving her from that awkward moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When are you free? Let's go to S City, but we'd better hurry. The witness is in custody at the police station right now. Hadwin said he has a way to make him talk. He asked if you want to be a part of this," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "Hadwin? You told him that I want to reverse my case?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hehe... Well... I thought he had more connections than I did, so I asked him to help me investigate that You guy to see if he can find any other clues. I'm sorry I forgot to tell you," answered Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have anything to apologize for. You're just helping me," said Grace. In her opinion, Hadwin was not a helpful person, but Lina had probably tried hard to get him to do this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When will you be free? I'll make an appointment with Hadwin, but we'd better hurry. That You guy is only being detained for seven days," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tomorrow, then," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tomorrow? Don't you have work tomorrow?" asked Lina. Although tomorrow was a weekend, it seemed Grace only had Saturday afternoons off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The small restaurant where I work is closed these days, so I'm free tomorrow. What about you? Are you free tomorrow?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I am," said Lina. "Tomorrow, then. I'll pick you up tomorrow. I'll go inform Hadwin. I'll talk to you later once we've fixed the time."</p></div>
