        <h1>Chapter 2110</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The neighbors were beaming as they received the wedding candies. They all crowded to Kyla's store and congratulated her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, you found a good husband. He's rich!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Congratulations! I heard your husband say that you two separated for years because of an accident, and he kept saying that he did you and Nelson wrong by letting you raise Nelson by yourself. After all that hard work, you're going to have a good life now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"This groom is so handsome. No wonder Nelson is so good-looking. He took after his father!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla could only smile dryly as the neighbors congratulated her. Mrs. Corbyn smiled less reluctantly. After all, the neighbors would gossip less after Martin Weiss did this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once the firecrackers finished sounding and they were done distributing the wedding candies, it was just about time for school to be over. As soon as Nelson Corbyn left the school, he saw his father standing at the store&rsquo;s entrance while their neighbors congratulated his parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A classmate approached Nelson Corbyn and asked curiously, "Is your family celebrating a happy event?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn blinked his eyes. After he heard the words &lsquo;may you live a long and happy life together and have many children and grandchildren&rsquo; sandwiched between the words of congratulation, he recalled what his mother had told him about getting married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Has Daddy and Mommy... gotten married?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">By this time, a student was rushing back after going to the store to find out what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as they saw Nelson Corbyn, they immediately said excitedly, "Nelson Corbyn, is that your father? Wow, he's so handsome! Besides, all those cars belong to your father and they said all those men in black suits are your father's. He's so amazing. He looks just like the big shots in TV shows."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The other classmates immediately looked at Nelson Corbyn with envy, and many female students' eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn only looked blankly at his father standing not far away and his mother standing at the store&rsquo;s entrance. He was still shocked by what was going on... &lsquo;Are Daddy and Mommy... married?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the Corbyn family's small living room, Kyla, Martin Weiss, Mrs. Corbyn, and Nelson stood silently while looking at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Compared to the excitement outside, it was quiet inside here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Finally, Mrs. Corbyn spoke first. "Ask... those men at the entrance to leave first, or others will think we're doing shady business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, Mom," Martin Weiss answered naturally. Then, he took out his phone and told his staff to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn choked when she heard the word &lsquo;Mom&rsquo;. Never in her life did she dream that Martin Weiss would call her &lsquo;Mom&rsquo; one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla and Nelson Corbyn looked at Martin Weiss with the same look of shock as if they were looking at something bizarre.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? What's wrong with me calling her &lsquo;Mom&rsquo;?" Martin Weiss looked at the three startled faces and slowly said, "Others will find it strange if I don't call her &lsquo;Mom&rsquo; but &lsquo;Aunt&rsquo;."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla had no idea what to answer for a moment. Just like what he had said, it was perfectly normal for him to call her mother &lsquo;Mom&rsquo; now that they were married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if their marriage was just a show, they should at least act their part.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn choked for a moment before saying, "Then... Then you can call me that for now, and..." She changed the topic. "Since you and Kyla have received your marriage license, let's have dinner together. There's something I want to say too."</p></div>
