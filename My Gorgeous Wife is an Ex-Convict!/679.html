        <h1>Chapter 678</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She patted him again and again before saying softly, "Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. There are no more nightmares. I'll stay with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know whether to laugh or cry. 'Does she think of me as a child?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was as if that lingering fear faded little by little along with her pats and gentle voice. Then, sleep caught up to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stay with me&hellip;' It seemed that with her company, he would not be afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not even Jason himself knew he would fall back asleep so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing the sound of his even breathing, Grace stopped and called out softly, "Jay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had fallen asleep and did not answer her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She breathed a sigh of relief. He was asleep, and his brows did not furrow as before. In his sleep, he looked just like an angel&mdash;So pure and serene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was completely different from the way he looked in front of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps, he was an angel only to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the dream of the little boy and the little girl, she did not want to tell him until she got to the bottom of it, or she would raise his suspicions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to know whether she had that dream because she once heard her cousin talk about it as a child, so she put herself in those shoes and dreamed about it, or... Was it because of another reason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay soon made the tabloids after she appeared beside Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, with Brian's protection, no media dug deep into Stella Lindsay's background. Even if they did, they dared not report it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people were wondering if she was Brian's new girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, there were a lot of people who did not think so. Firstly, Brian did not acknowledge her identity but just called her a friend. Secondly, she looked far worse than his previous girlfriends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she looked alright after dressing up, that was thanks to the skills of the makeup artist!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, there were all kinds of assumptions being made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay might be anxious and hoped to become Brian's girlfriend, but after all, she just got divorced. She could not behave too obviously for fear of undermining her reputation in Brian's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, when she was having dinner with Brian, she pretended to say casually, "By the way, have you been watching the news these days? A lot of people are wondering if I'm your girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry for causing you trouble. I'll make it clear to the reporters later," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's not troublesome. I'm single anyway, and I don't have anyone pursuing me, so it doesn't matter. It's just..." Stella Lindsay said immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She slightly bit her lower lip and said with some hesitation, "I read on the internet that you've had several girlfriends over the years, but you were only looking for substitutes. They also said&hellip; What if I'm a substitute too? What does that mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was stunned and stared at the face in front of him.</p></div>
