        <h1>Chapter 603</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Prove? How can I prove it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, as she watched him stare at her, she looked as if she had suddenly realized something. She hesitated, then took the initiative to raise her hands and put them around Jason's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she lifted her chin slightly and kissed him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips were cool, and his scent reassured her. Her kiss was shallow, only a touch on the lips, but it was an initiative from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The friction on the lips was filled with love... It was her proof of how crazy she was for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, such a kiss was not enough for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to withdraw from the kiss, his right hand grabbed the back of her head. His lips pressed hard against hers. He turned and sucked, prying open her teeth and squeezing the tip of his tongue into her mouth. He demanded all her sweetness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was startled by the sudden intensity of the kiss, but immediately, she became addicted to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss grew deeper and deeper, and he seemed to rob her of everything. He was kissing her until she could hardly breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace instinctively wanted to stop, but he would not let her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she slightly withdrew, his lips would chase after her once more, taking her lips and kissing her tenderly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He finally ended the kiss when her lips ached and she felt as if she was suffocating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ahem... Ahem..." Her lungs finally took in the fresh air. Grace choked while breathing in and out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, why did you..." However, his voice cut her short before she could finish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not enough... Not nearly enough... Grace, your proof is not nearly enough..." he said, pressing his finger against a seat button. Suddenly, the back of the seat she was sitting on tipped back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was caught off guard and had not loosened her seatbelt, so she was now in a lying position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He shifted from the driver's seat to the passenger seat. With his body upright, he took the tie off his neck completely and unbuttoned his shirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His deep, dark eyes stared at her. There was a clear desire in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Was he... Planning to do it in the car... They had sex before, and she did not mind having sex with him again. After all, she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they were currently in a car and in such a public place too. Even if there was no one around, it did not mean that there would be no one later!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If anyone was curious enough to walk up to the car and take a look... Well, she could not imagine that. Maybe then they would actually make the headlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" Grace wanted to unfasten her seatbelt and sit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand had just touched the buckle of the seatbelt when his hand immediately grasped the back of her hand. "Why, won't you prove it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not that. It's just this place..." Her body shuddered, and the rest of her voice seemed to be stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a click of the seat belt, his fingers had ripped open a part of the dress, revealing her bare shoulder. His lips moved to her shoulder, collarbone...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the thin and dense kisses kept pouring against her skin, he muttered, "Didn't you just admit that you desire me? Show me right now. Let me know how much you want me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're in a car and on a mountain..." Her skin had turned pink. She looked absolutely ravishing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what?" he asked in a mutter. All he wanted right now was to have her, to have her completely as if that was the only way to soothe his restlessness.</p></div>
