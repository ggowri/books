        <h1>Chapter 3055</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Reservoir, the reservoir is releasing water!" someone exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Immediately, someone exclaimed, "Damn, who released the water at this time? It's not the time to release water at all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What should we do? The person is still in the middle of the river, and the water is coming too fast. We don't have time to rescue them!" someone shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, there's no time! Valda could even see the water rushing towards them from afar!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Brian's mind went blank. He watched as Valda held onto the half-broken basket with one hand and a crying baby with the other. If anything else happened...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then both she and the baby would fall into the river!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never been so scared before, scared that something would happen to the woman holding the baby. His heart felt like it had stopped beating, and even breathing became difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never hated anyone so much before. He wished he could chop Phoebe and Whitney into a thousand pieces!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Basket, hurry! Get on the basket!" Suddenly, someone shouted at Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This voice also brought Brian back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That's right, the basket!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The basket that was originally intersecting with theirs is now moving towards them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as Valda climbs into the basket with the child, they can safely reach the shore before the water from the reservoir reaches them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But then, Brian's pupils suddenly shrank, and the voice he was about to shout out got stuck in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Valda doesn't have any extra hands to climb into the slowly moving basket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There are only two choices: either she throws the child down and climbs into the basket herself, or she throws the child into the basket first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The basket is moving and is about to pass the range she can reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she throws the child into the basket first, with the speed of the basket's movement and the reaction force, she won't have time to grab onto the basket again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda obviously also thought of this problem at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In fact, it has only been less than ten seconds since the basket she was riding in was detached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Time does not allow her to think too much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, she also understands why Phoebe said that she and the child could not both survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because... only one person can enter the suspended basket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Or it could be herself, or it could be Trista!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And the decision-making power is entirely in her own hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she were to abandon Jasmine at this moment, Grace would be heartbroken, and the Reed family would inevitably be shrouded in darkness in the future. Brian would live in self-blame and pain for the rest of his life because he would feel that it was his fault that Jasmine lost her life! He would feel responsible for Grace losing her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She doesn't want Brian to live in that kind of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, she has seen too much self-blame and guilt in Brian... The pain that is reflected in his eyes has gradually imprinted itself on her heart, bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And she didn't want him to be upset like this anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda quickly used the remaining time to throw the baby in her arms towards the hanging basket, hoping that Jasmine could be saved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least she completed her tasks well today and picked up Jasmine without any issues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment she threw the baby into the cradle, the cradle moved out of Valda's reach, and she could no longer catch the moving cradle.</p></div>
