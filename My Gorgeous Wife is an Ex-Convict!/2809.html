        <h1>Chapter 2807</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hurriedly said, "Of course, it's okay if you're not free. I... I'll go by myself. I always go by myself anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "I'm free. I can go with you. I was only thinking about what I'd need to take with me if I'm going to pay my respects."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She breathed a sigh of relief. "You don't have to bring anything. I'll prepare the incense sticks, candles, and food. You only have to show up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she lowered her head and continued eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching her lower her head, he felt pity rising in his heart. Speaking of which, he was an indifferent man. He seldom pitied others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he wanted to protect the woman, or at least ensure she did not get hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss soon arranged the accommodation and asked Kyla to move there. As Martin Weiss put it, they should go out since they were pretending to be a loving couple in front of the reporters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had also talked with her mother, but Mrs. Corbyn said, "Take Nelson and Trista with you. I'll stay in the store instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That won't do." Kyla disagreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not? We still have to run the store. Besides, I won't get used to it if I move in with you and Martin Weiss. You two are only faking it anyway. It'll bother me if there are reporters secretly taking photos. I&rsquo;d better stay in the store," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip and said nothing else in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She understood her mother's concerns and awkwardness. She and Martin Weiss were moving in not because of love but to put on a show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a marriage that would end sooner or later. It would only feel more awkward if her mother moved in and had to face Martin Weiss all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then call me every night before you go to bed, or I'll worry," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it," said Mrs. Corbyn as she looked at her daughter pitifully. "What about you moving in with Martin Weiss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla consoled her mother, saying, "It's not my first time anyway. Didn't I move in with him for a while before? It&rsquo;ll be over in a year or so anyway. I&rsquo;ll send Nelson to school during the day and bring Trista to look after the shop with you. I'll take the two children home with me after Nelson comes back from school."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, do whatever is convenient for you," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla began moving the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she was moving, she only brought some clothes and shoes she usually wore and the kids' items. Martin Weiss had already prepared the daily necessities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Nelson Corbyn finished school in the afternoon, Kyla took the two children and went to the place Martin Weiss had prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's men came to pick them up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her daughter in her arms and her son beside her, Kyla walked into the mansion Martin Weiss had bought in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the mother and children standing before him in the huge mansion. "Are you sure you don't need a nanny to look after Trista?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I can manage on my own," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, it's your choice," Martin Weiss answered indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn had been silent. He knew about his parents' deal. He knew his parents were only pretending to be a loving couple and that they would divorce in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not hate his father anymore, but he would choose his mother if he had to choose between his parents. He had to protect his mother!</p></div>
