        <h1>Chapter 3623</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just her silence alone has caused a wave of voices around her, saying, "They can't possibly be boyfriend and girlfriend, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I mean, wasn't it William's mother who almost destroyed the Reed family? How could Jasper really be in a relationship with William?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the end of the day, William is still the son of a criminal. Even if he's now the young master of the Barlow family, this stigma will follow him for a lifetime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These voices kept reaching Jasper's ears, and she knew that William was hearing them too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hands were still clasped together, but as these voices grew louder, his grip started to loosen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's heart suddenly tightened. Somehow, she had a feeling that if she let go of his hand now, she might never be able to hold onto it again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, her fingers tightened their grasp on his, gripping his hand tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her action clearly caught him by surprise, and William turned his head to look at Jasper with a hint of bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jasper's face remained focused on the cameras, and she spoke with a clear voice, "Yes, it's true. William and I are indeed in a relationship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as those words were spoken, there was an uproar around them. Even with security guards trying to hold back the crowd, some people managed to push their way to Jasper and William once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Reed, is what you just said true? Are you really in a relationship? Do your parents know? Will they agree? Or is it a secret relationship between the two of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you afraid that William is really as the internet says, deliberately getting close to you to seek revenge for his mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there any compelling reason for you to be in a relationship with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All sorts of questions were thrown at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Jasper simply held William's hand tightly and said, "I am in a relationship with William because I genuinely like him. My parents also approve of our relationship. I like William for who he is, regardless of whose child he is, it's him as a person that I like, not anything else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper continued, turning to look at William standing beside her. "Because I like him, love him, I also trust him and his sincerity towards me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William stared blankly at the person in front of him. Her voice was close to his ears, but it also felt somewhat distant, unreal, and dreamlike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has what he desperately longed for really become within reach?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her statement, Jasper turned to the cameras again. "Therefore, I hope everyone will not disturb our lives. Our relationship is our business, what does it have to do with all of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, you are all meddling in matters that don't concern you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pulled William and quickly rushed into the school gate while the security guards were blocking those people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled him and ran forcefully towards a secluded place, not wanting any more cameras to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They ran for who knows how long, until they reached a bamboo forest behind the school. She finally stopped her steps!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it was night time, the bamboo forest was pitch black, with only moonlight shining through the bamboo, sprinkling some light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper turned her head, panting, and looked at William. "Okay, it should be temporarily safe here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her with a fixed gaze, as if his eyes were filled with a thousand words. "Why did you say in front of those people that we are boyfriend and girlfriend?"</span></p></div>
