        <h1>Chapter 2916</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she loves me. Other women can give jewelry, cars, houses, and even various resources. I and those women are just using each other, but she..." What she wants is his love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he has not fallen in love with her yet, but he can't bear to let her go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wants to keep her by his side, to see her all the time, and most importantly, he wants to be the only one in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knows he is selfish, hoping that she can do what he cannot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, his phone rang. Brian Hart took out his phone, and after answering it for a moment, his face changed slightly. He put down his glass and prepared to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, where are you going?" Patrick Weiss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have something to take care of," Brian Hart said coldly, with a hint of gloom in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick Weiss was surprised. It was rare for his friend to show this expression. Could it be related to Valda Theller again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian Hart walked out of the hotel, the car was already waiting at the door, and the hotel staff respectfully opened the car door for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart was about to get in the car when Barbara Schuman suddenly rushed out from the side. However, before she could approach Brian Hart, she was stopped by the hotel security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Hart, I... I am Barbara Schuman. I beg you to spare my family. I... I can publicly apologize to Valda Theller and admit what I did to her back then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she could save The Schuman family, what did it matter to bow down in front of Valda Theller? After all, if The Schuman family was gone, she would be nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman knew very well that all her confidence came from The Schuman family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart's expression remained cold and indifferent. "I told you not to appear in front of me again. It seems that you really have a short memory."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After speaking, he ordered the security guard beside him, "Call the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." The security guard then dialed the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman watched as Brian Hart was about to get in the car, and she panicked, "Mrs. Hart, as long as you can spare The Schuman family, I can do anything for you! Mrs. Hart, I can repay everything I did to Valda Theller!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't repay it," Brian Hart said coldly. "What you did to Valda Theller, I want you to repay it a hundredfold. As for The Schuman family, since your parents condone you, they should also bear the consequences!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman stared at Brian Hart with hatred. Her fear and begging had turned into a twisted emotion. "You... What's the difference between what you're doing now and what I did to you back then, Brian Hart? You're just using your power to oppress people!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Brian Hart ignored her and got into the car. The car quickly left the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman collapsed on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was over. Everything was over. The Schuman family was over, and she was over! And all of this was because of Valda Theller!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who could have thought that an ordinary Valda Theller could make Brian Hart do such a thing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Barbara Schuman regretted it deeply. If she had known earlier, she would never have touched Valda Theller back then!</p></div>
