        <h1>Chapter 872</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted the rest of the crew to understand her relationship with Brian so that she could put on airs even though she was only playing a supporting role. Besides, the director would also give her extra scenes if that happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had planned all of this out, and at first, it was going just as she planned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Once Grace came along, everything changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Especially when Brian grabbed Grace by the wrist&hellip; A lot of the crew members saw this. Now that Brian's gone&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella could feel the gazes of those around her changing from envy to ridicule and sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's all because of Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I mustn't let Grace steal Brian away from me! Brian's my hope for my future. If I want to live a good life, I have to seize this chance with Brian!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to the prison again the next day to find Pansy Dittman. Pansy Dittman was sentenced to one year in prison for the accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, Grace just wanted to try her luck and see if she could sound her out. However, Pansy Dittman immediately rejected her and asked her to leave as soon as she heard Grace was the assistant of the plaintiff's lawyer, saying that everything should be decided by the court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace left, she deliberately asked Pansy Dittman if she had been scared by a dog darting out onto the road on the night of the accident. To which she immediately replied, "It wasn&rsquo;t a dog. It was a cat. A cat with yellow and gray stripes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her answer was too quick, too urgent, and too sure. She even said the cat's fur pattern as if to convince people that there was such a cat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it was a cat. I remembered it wrong," Grace said with a smile, but she already had an answer in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sure enough, there's something fishy about this! Pansy Dittman probably took the blame for this. The real driver behind the cause of the accident was probably Elise Dean!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had been thinking about the case on her way home. Although she had a general conclusion in mind, the law was all about evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'All I have are the witnesses' testimonies and... my speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'These are not enough to form a chain of evidence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What can I do to get the police to re-investigate the case?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace still had no idea what to do when she got down from the bus and approached the neighborhood of her rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, two men stopped her. One of them asked, "You're Grace, aren't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. Looking at the two unfamiliar faces in front of her as well as the aggressive expressions on their faces, she only found them hostile. As such, she immediately said, "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, her denial did not make any difference. The other guy smiled and said, "She has some brains, but we've seen your photos. You're definitely Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a pity that some people aren't smart enough and did more than they needed to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they spoke, the two men attacked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to run away, but the pair quickly grabbed onto her. As she struggled and screamed, one of the men shouted to onlookers, "My girlfriend and I are just quarreling. Mind your own business!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people in the neighborhood were complicated, and most were riff-raffs. They saw it more as a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace was about to be dragged into the car by the two men, one of the men who was holding her was suddenly kicked to the ground. When the other man was about to strike back, he was already grabbed by the collar and knocked to the ground.</p></div>
