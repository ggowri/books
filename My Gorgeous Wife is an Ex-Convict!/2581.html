        <h1>Chapter 2579</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her best friend's red eyes, Kyla knew what was on her mind, so she stood still nearby and did not make a sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were some emotions that outsiders simply could not help with. They could only process those emotions themselves. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Kyla's phone suddenly rang. She took it out to see an unfamiliar caller ID.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she pressed the answer button, what the person said shocked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this Miss Corbyn? I'm Mr. Martin Weiss's attorney. Mr. Weiss has entrusted me with full authority to handle your and Mr. Weiss's divorce. He has entrusted me to draw up a divorce agreement. I hope you can come to our law firm to take a look at the agreement when you're free. You can also let us know if you have any objections. We'll pass the message on to Mr. Weiss and revise the agreement accordingly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze, only feeling as though the voice on the other end of the line was becoming infinitely distant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn?" The lawyer's voice on the other end of the line grew louder due to the long silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Kyla suddenly came to her senses. "Okay... I... I got it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The address of my law firm is..." The person gave the address and said, "I wonder when you'll be free? I&rsquo;ll make time for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated slightly. "Tomorrow, then. I'll come over tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, how about tomorrow afternoon? We can send a car to pick you up," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to send a car to pick me up. Tomorrow afternoon it is, then," said Kyla before putting her phone away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell, who was nearby, saw her best friend's pale face and asked, "What's wrong? What happened? Is there anything I can help you with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly. "No thanks. It was a call from the law firm. Martin Weiss has entrusted them to draft the divorce agreement. They want me to go over and take a look at it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss's divorcing you?" Amber Mitchell froze. She remembered how Martin Weiss had accompanied Kyla to the mental hospital to see her and visited her after she was rescued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought Kyla's suffering had ended. Besides, Martin Weiss seemed nice to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, divorce. I married him just so that the child would have a legitimate identity. Now that the baby is born, divorce is inevitable," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell stared at her best friend. Although she said it was inevitable, the expression on her face was a clear sign of her reluctance to give up the marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You married him for the baby and nothing more?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent for a long moment before saying with a bitter smile, "He loved me when I married him, but I only wanted to give my unplanned baby a legitimate identity. However..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla told Amber Mitchell about her and Martin Weiss&rsquo;s story. Finally, she said, "Funny, isn't it? I thought I didn&rsquo;t love him enough while he loved me too deeply, so I chose to separate. But now that he has stopped loving me, I love him too deeply."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell had never heard of hypnotizing feelings in such a way. It was not amnesia, but one could diminish such unforgettable feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He didn't seem to have no affection for you when I saw the way he treated you in Deer City," said Amber Mitchell. She even thought Martin Weiss loved her best friend deeply.</p></div>
