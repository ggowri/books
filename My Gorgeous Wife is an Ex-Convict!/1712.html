        <h1>Chapter 1710</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It&rsquo;s nothing. I just thought I'd come and have a look," said Jason. After all, he did not want her to get excited before he confirmed things. It would be better to wait until he got the final result before telling her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you in a bad mood?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think I came here because I'm in a bad mood?" Jason said with a slight twinkle in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You&rsquo;re not in a bad mood?" Her almond-shaped eyes stared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No." He shook his head and pulled her into his arms. "I'm not in a bad mood. On the contrary, I'm feeling quite good." At the very least, Mason might be their lost child, and she would be overjoyed if it turned out to be true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would be able to see her smile. These days, there would be a lingering sadness in her eyes even though she was smiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was confused. "Did anything happen today that made you so happy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Isn't the fact that you're right by my side good enough to make me happy?" he whispered as he lowered his head to kiss her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His father would have been happy to see that he could be with the one he loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace and I are still together after going through so much. I won't end up like my father! Grace... isn't like my mother. She'll always be by my side and will never leave!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Never!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the restaurant, Anthony Sherman looked at Lina who appeared to be in a trance as she stared at someone passing by the restaurant window. He could not help asking, "What's wrong? Why do you keep staring?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ah!" Lina finally came to her senses and quickly said, "Nothing. I just thought that person&rsquo;s back is a little familiar, but... it's not someone I know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, Lina lowered her head and began to eat the food in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That person's back looks a bit like Hadwin Stephenson&rsquo;s." Anthony Sherman's voice rang in Lina's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's body stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Yes, that person's back did look like Hadwin Stephenson&rsquo;s. For a moment, she even thought she saw Hadwin Stephenson but realized it was not him after taking a closer look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sorry!" she looked up at Anthony Sherman and said earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman smiled. "What's there to be sorry about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina hesitated a little before saying, "Perhaps we can't be a couple, after all. Sorry. After everything that has happened, you've been encouraging me, supporting me, and believing in me. I appreciate that, but... I'm sorry that I can't seem to like you romantically."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is it because the person you like has always been Hadwin Stephenson?" Instead of getting furious, Anthony Sherman said it as though he had expected it.</p></div>
