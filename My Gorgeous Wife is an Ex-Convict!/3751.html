        <h1>Chapter 3749</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the security guards were not as polite as before. They directly grabbed Vanessa and her friends' hands and dragged them out of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it! Who do you think you are to drag me? Do you know who I am? You and your restaurant will pay for this..." Vanessa kept cursing and struggling, but it was useless. In just a moment, she was dragged out of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for her group of friends, they naturally left obediently when they saw this scene. However, before leaving, one of them said to Veronica, "Veronica, don't be too happy. You'll have a hard time at school later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's face darkened as he heard the threat from the girl to Veronica. He stared at her with his cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl trembled and quickly avoided Mason's gaze before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, the manager hurriedly approached Mason and apologized for the disturbance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. It's not your fault," Mason said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mason. Let me comp your meal today," the manager tried to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," Mason declined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager then left and the restaurant returned to its quiet state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want me to take care of those girls for you?" Mason asked. The things they said disgusted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," Veronica replied. "The truth will come out eventually. If we try to fight every rumor, we'll never catch up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know we won't catch up?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was taken aback. Well, with the Reed family's power, they could definitely catch up. But...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those girls you saw earlier, Vanessa, my classmate, clearly thinks her family's money gives her the right to bully others. I know you could bully her back, but I don't want you to become someone who uses money to bully others. Besides, they already got what they deserved," Veronica explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do unto others as they do unto you. Isn't that a good thing?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that it's not good. Sometimes, society works that way. And sometimes, it's the most effective way. But I'm afraid that if we use this method, we'll lose ourselves," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you don't like this method?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that I don't like it. It's just that I'm afraid we'll lose ourselves while punishing </span><span>others," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like earlier, the manager clearly kicked Vanessa and her friends out without hesitation because of your status," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica understood all of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was to deal with bad people or for self-defense, she wouldn't mind, but she didn't want him to use this kind of method on innocent people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Daniel back then... he was actually innocent! Although in the end, it was Daniel's choice, if Mason hadn't made Daniel choose between money and love, maybe her breakup with Daniel wouldn't have been so unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, if I'm really targeted at school and can't solve it, I'll let you know." Veronica looked at Mason. "And... thank you for caring about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze met hers, and his expression suddenly seemed off as he lowered his head. His heart beat more violently than usual, and a feeling that he was once familiar with surged up.</span></p></div>
