        <h1>Chapter 833</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stumbled as her knees went weak. She was about to fall over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, an arm grabbed her waist and prevented her from falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong with your leg?" Brian asked coldly. He saw her limping over earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's an old problem," said Grace before she thanked him for his help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together and withdrew his hand while his gaze fell on her legs. 'Old problem. Does she have such old problems?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, are you okay?" Stella was quick to show her sisterly affection. "If your legs are uncomfortable, you can sit down and have a rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glanced coldly at her cousin. If her cousin really cared about her, she would not have looked on coldly while happily playing pool as she stood there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row was stunned and said with an unnatural expression on his face, "You know... each other?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, Grace's my cousin," Stella said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row's expression suddenly became more unnatural. Then, he turned to Grace and said, "Hey, why didn't you tell me earlier? If you had told me, I would&rsquo;ve signed it already."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you sign it now?" said Grace as she handed the document to Curtis Row.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, sure!" Curtis Row replied quickly. Then, he took the document and signed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the document back, turned around, and was about to limp away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had only taken a few steps when a hand grabbed her arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up in surprise at Brian. "Mr. Hart, is there anything else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed distracted as he stared at his hand that was holding Grace's arm. 'What's wrong with me? I've told myself not to bother about this woman.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had made an exception for not watching her fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he saw that she was about to limp away, he subconsciously wanted to offer to send her home!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So what if she has some old problem with her leg? This woman brought this upon herself.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could easily get Curtis Row to sign the document through Jason's connections, but she just had to go to so much trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian." Stella looked anxiously at Brian and wished she could just pull his hand away from Grace's arm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I should be his savior, but why does he have to bother about Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian finally seemed to come back to his senses and promptly withdrew his hand. "Why didn't Jason come with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace did not answer. She just lowered her head and limped away from the banquet room, suppressing the pain in her knee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at the figure that left somewhat awkwardly, his thin lips pressing into a straight line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella looked at Brian with unconcealed concern and jealousy. The way he looked at Grace's departing back made her feel as if he only had Grace in his eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even if I&rsquo;ve taken Grace's place... Is there still something I can&rsquo;t replace?'</p></div>
