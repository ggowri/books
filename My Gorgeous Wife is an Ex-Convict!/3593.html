        <h1>Chapter 3591</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you... have nothing else to say?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Something else?" he looked at her, "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip slightly, the post on the school forum had already become popular, he couldn't possibly not know about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially since he had told her he liked her and would wait for her to give him an answer after considering it carefully. This post made her even more uneasy, afraid that he might misunderstand something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, Jasper said directly, "It was today, I went to apologize to Roger, but accidentally got photographed and the pictures were posted on the school forum. These pictures could easily cause misunderstandings, and I...I was afraid you might misunderstand..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She finally managed to say it all, and after finishing, she nervously looked at him, waiting for his reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he just smiled gently and said, "I know about that post, I've seen it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at him in surprise and asked, "Have you seen it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I have seen it. So you can rest assured that I won't misunderstand anything," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was stunned for a moment before asking, "Do you...do you not think that Roger and I are like what the post says?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I don't," he said firmly. Even though he had a moment of jealousy when he saw the photo in the post, he quickly calmed down. "With your personality, if you really wanted to be with Roger, you would have told me clearly. So since you didn't tell me, it must be a misunderstanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His simple words made all her worries disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at him, and indeed, he was the person who understood her the most in this world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you still waiting for my answer?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, but you can take your time to think it over. No need to rush to answer me," he said. He had the patience to wait until she had thought it through before answering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper smiled, "Okay, I will think it over carefully!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once she had figured out her feelings, she would definitely give him an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper went back home in the evening to prepare for his trip to Deer Capital tomorrow. She planned to pack her luggage and prepare a gift for her Grandpa Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Jasper was packing, she suddenly heard a voice behind her asking, "Do you really like that Roger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She almost choked on her own saliva and turned around to see the handsome face of her older brother, Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was the most similar to their father in appearance among the triplets. However, unlike their father, Mick appeared colder, while their father had a more charming vibe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, this could also be related to the fact that he doesn't talk much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big brother, how do you know Roger?" Jasper exclaimed in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You and him both posted on your school forum twice, I know now, and it's already late," Mick said. "Do you like him?"</p></div>
