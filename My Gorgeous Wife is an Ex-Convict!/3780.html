        <h1>Chapter 3778</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was stunned, staring at the person in front of her, completely unaware that he was the one who caused him the most pain back then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry," she said, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I accept," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked her eyes, was that it?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, he accepted her apology, which was the best outcome, but why did she feel like something was off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like...too casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, it was more like the weight of these things had been building up in her heart for so many years that it had become too heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she had understood her feelings earlier, they wouldn't have wasted all these years, and he wouldn't have been hypnotized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of feeling was it to remember everything that had happened but not feel the same emotions anymore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he really feel nothing as he claimed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or was it...a feeling too heavy for him, just like her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica suddenly stood up and hugged Mason. "We must never be apart again, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never?" He lowered his eyes and rested his head on her chest. "There's nothing in this world that's 'never.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such promises were as elusive as the word "forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's try our best to make 'never' come true," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you think that if we work hard, we won't have to be apart anymore?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I love you, and you love me too. As long as we trust each other enough, nothing can separate us except death," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason suddenly looked up, his beautiful black eyes staring straight at Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You love me, and I love you?" His voice was huskier than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," she said, meeting his gaze without flinching. "Or did I say something wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyelashes trembled slightly, and his gaze became even deeper. After what seemed like an eternity, he finally said, "No, you're right. You love me, and I love you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that his feelings for her, even under hypnosis, would still fall in love with her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only her! Because she was the one he was destined to love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt as if her whole body was enveloped in a warm embrace. In this moment, she couldn't help but lower her head and kiss his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved him, really loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she seemed to have realized this fact a little too late. If she had realized it earlier, their pain would have been much less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, she would love him better! She would work hard to heal the wounds of the past and make them happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kiss, initiated by her, was gentle at first, but after he took control, it became dominant and intense, as if all their emotions were poured into this kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kiss made her almost breathless. Just when she thought her heart was about to stop, his lips finally parted from hers.</span></p></div>
