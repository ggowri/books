        <h1>Chapter 3406</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the end... he didn't avoid it, and instead let her take his hand with her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's so cold!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is Jasper's first impression, his hand is so cold!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, actually I didn't just find out about this today. I knew about it a long time ago! But over the years, haven't we been good to each other? Besides, it was your mother who caused trouble for my mother, not you! I dislike your mother, but she's no longer here. My mother said that since she's gone, everything should end here," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this the end? William pursed his lips, wondering if everything could really end here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the things that the mother had done seemed like stains that he couldn't erase, and they would always exist between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at his gloomy face and continued, "William, to me, you are you, and your mother is your mother! We will be together, and we will always be together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He remained silent for a while before stammering, "Why don't you mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She responded with a slightly amused tone, "Why should I mind? We're friends, and you're so good to me. If I still minded, wouldn't that be wrong? Besides, my parents don't mind either!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she placed his hand to her lips and blew warm air onto his cold hand. Then she rubbed his hand repeatedly with her own palm, trying to warm it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If anyone says anything about you again, I'll help you give them a good beating," she said, but then added somewhat embarrassedly, "Just now was the first time I've ever slapped someone, and my palm hurts so much! I didn't realize that slapping someone would hurt my own hand so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your hand hurts?" He was surprised and took her hand to examine her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, I haven't warmed up your hand yet," she exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he only asked, "Does it hurt a lot? Is it painful here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he moved his fingertips around her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay now, not as painful as before," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nevertheless, he continued to massage her palm, saying, "Don't do it again next time. Your hands are precious as a pianist, and they can't be easily injured. If you really hurt them, you won't be able to practice for a while, and you'll suffer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if they keep talking about you and make you feel upset, what will you do?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took her hand to his lips and gently kissed her palm, saying "As long as you don't make me sad, I won't be sad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Jasper felt his heart racing and his palms getting even hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's even more fiery than when I slapped you just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, outside the hotel where the birthday banquet is being held, a figure sits inside a car, looking through the window at the brilliantly lit hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the best hotel in Emerald City. A few days ago, news media reported that the Reed family chose to have their triplets' birthday party here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tonight is also a night where the elite of Emerald City gather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy's eyes gazed quietly at the hotel's entrance. After a while, he spoke up and said, "Let's go, let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," responded the driver in the front seat.</p></div>
