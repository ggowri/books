        <h1>Chapter 1385</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Kyla Corbyn ended the call, she quickly ran out of the hospital, took a taxi, and went straight to the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she arrived at the restaurant, Kyla Corbyn came to the private room Paisley Daniels mentioned. As soon as she pushed the private room door open, she saw Mr. Daniels, Mrs. Daniels, Paisley Daniels, and Nelson in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several people who looked like the Daniels family's subordinates were standing around, intimidating others with just their looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was sitting at the table. There were lots of delicious foods and toys on it, but the little one did not touch them and just sat quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as he saw Kyla Corbyn, a smile finally appeared on the little one's unhappy face. He quickly jumped down from his chair and ran to Kyla Corbyn. "Mommy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn hugged her son and made sure that her son was not hurt before feeling relieved. "Alright, I'm here! Let's go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But they said they brought me here to wait for Daddy!" muttered Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had only followed them here because he wanted to see his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had gone to the amusement park with him last time, but he fell asleep in the car on the way back and did not get to bid goodbye to his father, which made him regret it for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn bit her lip slightly. "Why don't we see Daddy later? Let's go home first. Grandma's worried sick when she didn't get to pick you up at the kindergarten today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson immediately became anxious when he heard this. He nodded his little head and decided to go home with Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as Kyla Corbyn held her son's hand, two of the Daniels family's subordinates stopped them before they reached the private room&rsquo;s door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Daniels's voice rang out. "Kyla Corbyn, since you're already here, why be so quick to leave? Paisley is marrying Martin and Nelson will become Paisley's stepson soon. Don't you think you should thank Paisley for putting the past behind her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stopped in her tracks. The door to the private room was closed, and several strong men were blocking her. As a woman with a child, it would not be easy for her to force her way out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Putting the past behind?" she sneered and turned to look at the Daniels family. "We all know exactly what had happened back then. Why speak so hypocritically?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about? Kyla Corbyn, you pushed Paisley down the stairs and made Paisley miscarry. You're a murderer! Now that Paisley is going to help you raise your son, won't you even apologize?" Mrs. Daniels said crossly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My mommy's not a murderer nor a bad person!" The quiet Nelson now shouted like an angry lion cub.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, nobody in the Daniels family paid the little one any attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Daniels only said lightly, "Apologize to Paisley and the Daniels family today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Apologize...' Kyla Corbyn just found it funny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had asked her to apologize to Paisley Daniels before this, and now, the Daniels family was also asking her to apologize to Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Previously, she had only been willing to kneel and apologize to Paisley Daniels to fulfill her son's wish of going to the amusement park as a family of three, but that did not mean she was willing to apologize this time&mdash;especially not in front of her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if everyone around her believed she was guilty, she still wanted her son to know that she was innocent and that she had been wronged!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want her son to think that he had a criminal as his mother. She did not want to become a heavy burden to him and affect his mental state, so she could not and should not make this apology no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't apologize because I've never harmed anybody!" Kyla Corbyn said firmly. Her thin and frail body was standing straight as if to show her son that she was innocent.</p></div>
