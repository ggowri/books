        <h1>Chapter 593</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands, which had fallen to her sides, were clenched into fists. It was some kind of oppressive tolerance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boss had checked her information previously and knew that she was imprisoned for the death of Jennifer Atkinson after a car accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not go through the details of the case. Now, listening to what others were saying, she... Pleaded not guilty at the trial, saying she was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she really wronged? Jennifer Atkinson's death had nothing to do with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The colleague simply explained the incident without taking any sides, but how could someone who was the boss of the firm not understand the fishy business in it? Immediately, the way he looked at Andrea Schwartz grew a little colder. Then, he turned to look at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I'm sorry this happened to you. How about this? The firm will compensate you for any of your losses. You can list it out later," said the boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said lightly, "No thanks, I still have work!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she looked at Brian, took the suit jacket off, and returned it to him. "Thank you." Her shirt was still wet and in a translucent state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace just wanted to get out of here immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can keep it on. You don't have to return it to me," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boss looked at Brian in surprise. He had known Brian for years and knew that the entertainment industry's crown prince was normally indifferent. Even if someone was hacked to death in front of him, he probably could not care less.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he was obviously concerned about a woman. This... Was really a surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">None of his former girlfriends probably ever got his attention like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right," Grace said insistently. Although her shirt was translucent and it was embarrassing for people to see her undergarment underneath, she might as well pretend she was wearing a swimsuit. If anything, she did not want to be associated with Brian. "Thank you for just now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a polite thank you, she shoved the suit into Brian's hand and turned away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at the suit in his hand. She gave a polite but unfamiliar thank you. It was like saying thank you to a stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he a stranger to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, the thought flashed through his mind and made him feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned around and chased after her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a great silence in the general room of the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz was dumbstruck. What was going on? Did the entertainment industry's crown prince have anything to do with Grace? Other people were usually the ones currying the crown prince's favor, but now... Why did it look as if the crown prince was the one trying to curry Grace's favor?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come to my office later," the boss said to Andrea Schwartz with a livid expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz immediately stiffened. The way her colleagues looked at her now turned into that of pity and ridicule.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These looks... Were what she had hoped Grace would suffer, but she ended up being the one on the receiving end.</p></div>
