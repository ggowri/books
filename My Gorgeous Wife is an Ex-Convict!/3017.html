        <h1>Chapter 3015</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian wasn't surprised at all and said to Valda, "The only one Mason truly accepted was the sister who was fostered by that family. As for Jason and Grace, Mason only reluctantly accepted them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda said, 'Mason doesn't seem to talk to others much.' When she greeted Mason earlier, the little guy only glanced at her with his beautiful eyes and then... looked away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It is clear that there is no interest in responding to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He doesn't talk much. At first, Grace and the others were worried about autism or something, but the test results turned out fine," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I always feel that if things continue like this, in the future, when the child grows up, Mason's attachment to his sister will turn into romantic love. If the little girl also loves him, then everything will be fine. Otherwise, I'm afraid..." Valda didn't continue speaking, because if she did, it would be a bit ominous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now the child is still young. Besides, even if Mason really likes that girl, do you think Jason would use any means to hurt his son emotionally?" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But when it comes to emotions, sometimes even the most extreme measures may not work. If using tactics could really win someone's affection, then the term 'hard to read' wouldn't exist," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pondered for a moment before responding, "You're right. I oversimplified things. But even if they do end up falling in love, it would be years down the line."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"True," Valda chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little did they know about the concept of 'young love.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda walked alongside Brian, greeting many people along the way. Brian introduced her to many people, and at times, Valda felt like he was deliberately trying to socialize with others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she voiced her confusion, he admitted, "Yes, I am doing it on purpose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" Valda didn't think of him as someone who would deliberately try to get closer to people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I want them to know that you're my girlfriend," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted others to know that Valda was his girlfriend, to have her identity stamped with his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt a little embarrassed upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, Grace and Jason saw the way Brian and Valda stood together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled at her husband and said, "Maybe soon we'll be toasting to Brian and Valda's wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Jason's eyes flickered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard from Valda that she's already met Brian's parents," Grace said with a hint of emotion. "Brian takes relationships seriously. If he's chosen Valda, then he must be serious about her. Just look at the way he looks at her, like she's the only one in his eyes. That's the look of someone in love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In love?" Jason looked at Brian and after a moment, a smile appeared on his lips. "You're right. Sometimes I don't see things as clearly as you do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace didn't understand. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing. I'm just praising you for being good at reading people," Jason said. Sometimes, he thought he understood people, but his assumptions could be wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People who overthink things might miss the simple things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Jason was like that, was Brian the same?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Loving someone without realizing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when it comes to matters of the heart, only the individual can slowly experience it.</p></div>
