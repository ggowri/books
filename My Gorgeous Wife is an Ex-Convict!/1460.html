        <h1>Chapter 1459</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian pressed his thin lips together tightly, but his phoenix eyes were just looking at Grace. "If you find out one day that Jason isn't who you think he is and can't bear to stay with him, will you... let me take care of you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a slight quiver in his voice, which showed that it was not easy for him to say that. He had mustered up almost all his courage to say that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe it was his... only chance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He almost held his breath after saying that, and the hands at his sides trembled imperceptibly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He nervously waited for her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned for a moment and then felt Jason's hand tightening around her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is Jay... feeling uneasy again?' Grace squeezed Jason's hand and said to Brian, "No, and there's no way whatever you just said will happen. I just want to be with Jay now and in the future as well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her affirmation made Brian's eyes flash with disappointment. His nervous heart seemed to empty all of a sudden, and he smiled wryly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What was I expecting?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, let's go." This time, it was Grace who took the initiative to drag Jason away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The group of bodyguards followed them and filed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian stood there, stunned. Even though Grace had already gotten in the car and was no longer in sight, he still stood there motionless with dark currents in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Grace and Jason got in the car, she suddenly touched his face. "Why do you look so pale?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason shuddered suddenly as if he had been surprised. After a moment, he said upon coming back to his senses, &ldquo;Do I look pale?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, it's like you're facing a lot of trouble. What's the matter? Is Grandpa's death going to cause trouble for Reed Group?" asked Grace. After all, she rarely saw the gloomy, sad look that had just appeared on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There's nothing to worry about. Don't overthink it," said Jason. However, out of the corners of his eyes, he kept <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>glancing out of the window vaguely... Brian was standing not far away, looking at them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt sleepy when she and Jason got back to Reed Residence. After all, she was already seven months along and was a little tired after the funeral today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a simple meal, Grace lay down in bed and went to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had closed her eyes, so she did not see that the way Jason was looking at her was full of intense sorrow and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Moments later, he pulled out his phone and sent a message...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace woke up, Jason was not in the room. She got up, briefly washed up, and checked the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her nap was shorter than expected. She had only slept for about an hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Where's Jay? Could he be downstairs?'</p></div>
