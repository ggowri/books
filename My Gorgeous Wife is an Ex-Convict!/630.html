        <h1>Chapter 629</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had just finished washing her hands and was about to dry them with a paper towel when suddenly she saw a figure. She was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When that person saw her, they also looked shocked and asked, "What brings you here, Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not expect to see Andrea Schwartz here. Instead of the formal suit she usually saw Andrea Schwartz wearing, she was now dressed like a cleaner in the building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, can't I come here?" asked Grace coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was disgusted with Andrea Schwartz after she used her case as a case study for the rookies in the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though you may think that some people were just petty, their evil intentions could be far beyond your imagination. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz stared at Grace in hatred. She was now a joke to the whole firm. As a lawyer, she was forced to clean the bathroom. It was all thanks to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that Brian would stand up for Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After that incident, she was called into the office by the firm's boss who gave her two options. She would either be fired or transferred to a job where she would clean the bathrooms for a while. The rest would depend on the circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long struggle, she chose the second option. After all, she had not found another job and she would not be able to get by in front of her relatives and boyfriend if she did not have a job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she was now cleaning the bathrooms here, except for her colleagues in the company, her relatives and boyfriend did not know about it. Once she found the right law firm, she would leave this place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect Grace to see her like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz felt even more bitter at the thought of Grace, whom she had once laughed at, witnessing her current miserable state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she had a flash of inspiration. As Grace turned to leave the bathroom, she reached into her pocket and secretly switched on the recording function. Then, she put her hand that was holding the phone behind her back and hurried up to catch up with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hold on! What's your relationship with Brian, Grace? Why was he so protective of you that day? He also gave you his suit jacket. You've known each other for a long time and you're close, right?" said Andrea Schwartz, trying to manipulate Grace into saying what she wanted to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace only said coldly, "Get out of the way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How would Andrea Schwartz do that? "Answer me first, Grace. I'm already in such a miserable state. At least make things clear for me. Brian was so protective of you, you must know him well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, Grace did not fall for it. Instead, she went around Andrea Schwartz and walked toward the bathroom exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz panicked and ran after her, shouting, "Did Brian's breakup have something to do with you, Grace? Was it because you got in between them? Don't you have a boyfriend? Is this fair to your boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately stopped in her tracks and turned to look at Andrea Schwartz who seemed to have gone too far. "I&rsquo;m warning you, if you say anything more, I&rsquo;ll sue you for slander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did I get it right?" Andrea Schwartz felt proud instead. "I just don't know whether Brian knows you have a boyfriend. Hey, you&rsquo;d better not be cheating! I can't believe that after being in prison for years, you've forgotten even this basic decency..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a loud slap interrupted Andrea Schwartz and slammed her into the wall headfirst with a bang.</p></div>
