        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He paused for a while before glancing at the two people, who were still dumbstruck. "Then don't let them step into this house again."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harold rocked back on his heels in shock and Lily immediately shivered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's words were undoubtedly telling these two that if they left without finding the ring, it would mean severing all ties with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that Jason had left, Harold and Lily looked at each other in dismay.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although the pool in front of them was not too deep, it was still about 100 square meters. Even worse, the bottom of the pool was covered with mud and algae, so it would not be easy to find a small ring.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily was about to cry. "Dad, what should I do? Do I really have to go down and look for the ring? Can't we call someone or try and reason with Jason? This is ridiculous!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The man doesn&rsquo;t give a shit about your excuses, Lily. Whatever trouble you've caused, you have to solve it yourself. If the Reed Group really breaks ties with our family, you no doubt know what will happen to us in the future!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since it was related to the future of his family, even though it was his daughter, Harold could not tolerate any resistance.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily was silent. Of course, she knew that many of the big businesses in her family&rsquo;s holdings relied on the Reed Group. If Jason turned hostile, it would be a devastating blow to her family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily felt helpless and could only walk into the pool step by step. It was so cold and the water smelled like a swamp. She began to look for the small ring, bending down and feeling along the bottom.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She winced and screamed several times. When she scraped against rocks and god-knew-what.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What if there were turtles? She could lose a finger.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had not expected Jason to take revenge for Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And now that he had, she wondered what else he might do to her next.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Jason returned to the apartment, he saw Grace washing clothes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her hands were soaked in ice-cold water and they had already turned red from the cold.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why don't you use hot water?" he asked with a frown.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hot water needs to be boiled, which will use a lot of electricity. Besides, if you wash with cold water for a while, your hands will start to heat up." Grace said. She soaked the clothes again and wrung them out to dry.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He took her hands in his. They were so, so cold.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Next time, use hot water when you wash clothes. Just use the electricity, and I will earn the money," he said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She could not help laughing. She raised her hand and patted his shoulder. "It's alright, I should save money whenever I can. There'll be many places to spend money in the future. How was dinner with your colleagues tonight, was it enjoyable?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Not bad," Jason replied. Dinner with his colleagues had been his excuse tonight. If he had guessed correctly, then Lily would still be looking for the ring in the Reed family's pond.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wondered how long Lily would spend.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It seems to have grown a little longer," Grace muttered, bringing Jason back to reality. He saw the person before him raising her hand to gently press his hair back.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay, why don't I trim your hair for you? When it's long like this, it's got to be annoying, getting in your face and whatnot.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He laughed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His hair was tied back during the day, and he only left it down around her and while in her environment so people wouldn&rsquo;t recognize him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She ran her hands through his hair again. &ldquo;I think it will look so good,&rdquo; she said as if already envisioning it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He stared at her with a bright glint in his eyes. Moments later, he slowly said, "Alright."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace only had simple tools&mdash;a comb and a pair of scissors. Then, she took a piece of cloth and wrapped it around Jason's neck.</p></div>
