        <h1>Chapter 3507</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the room, only Lionel and Mason were left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel quickly closed the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Rosalind approached the door stealthily and pressed her ear against it to eavesdrop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer frowned and quickly tried to pull his wife away, whispering, "What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just listen, aren't you curious why Lionel wants to meet Mason alone?" Rosalind asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's there to be curious about? He just wants Mason to find a way to save him from going to jail, right?" Archer replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But there's no need to meet separately, is there? I mean, there must be something else!" Rosalind said, looking like she wanted to eavesdrop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer looked embarrassed, and Veronica was also puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Indeed, if Lionel just didn't want to go to jail and wanted Mason's help, there was no need for a private meeting. So, is there really something unknown in this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, inside the room, Lionel said to Mason, "Mason, you have to save me, you have to save me! I did this to my sister because of you! If it weren't for you, I...I wouldn't have ended up like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because of me?" Mason looked coldly at Lionel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, that's right. It was all for you. When you had a fight with my sister, I...I felt that things couldn't go on like this. So, I kidnapped my sister and sent you a message, asking for your cooperation. Didn't you rush to the scene as soon as possible afterwards? You've made up with my sister now, so you can't just abandon us. You have to save me!" Lionel said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Mason's face grew darker and darker. The kidnapping was all because of this reason?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, he did arrive at the scene as soon as possible, but he had never seen the message Lionel mentioned. In fact, after he and Veronica had a cold war, Lionel called him several times, but he found it annoying and eventually added Lionel's number to his blacklist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, he could not have received any messages from Lionel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have never received any messages from you," Mason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To Lionel at this moment, Mason's words were undoubtedly a betrayal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel's face immediately changed, "Mason, how could you do this? You used me and now that you think I'm useless, you plan to kick me out? I kidnapped my sister for you, and now that you and my sister have made up, you don't care about me anymore?!"</p></div>
