        <h1>Chapter 217</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her assistant saw this and hurriedly followed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The weather was a little cool at the beginning of April. The male extras were doing well as there was room for more clothes in their costumes. However, for good effect, the director only allowed the female extras to wear some base clothes under the servant girls' costume to avoid the women from appearing bulky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the female extras were all slightly shivering now. One after another, they put on their coats while they rested and just watched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Grace, who was still in her costume, knelt and groveled over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Evelyn, since it was not an official shooting, she had been wearing a warm coat over her costume from the very beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh dear, I don't know if they've watched you carefully. Why don't you kneel again and slow down so that the others can watch more carefully," Evelyn said to Grace again, not letting her finish her actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her coldly before calmly saying, "Sure!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After that, she knelt again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At such time, it was more or less obvious to everyone there that Evelyn was just troubling her on purpose!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn just wanted to see Grace in pain, but Grace would not let her get it her way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the thought of this, Evelyn suddenly let go of her hand. A stove prop she had been holding in her hands slid straight out. All that was heard was a bang and a dull grunt of agony from Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The copper stove hit Grace's left hand as she was kneeling and groveling. If the stove prop was dropped slightly to the side, it would have hit Grace on the head!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace straightened up, feeling only a sharp pain on her left hand. When she looked at Evelyn, she saw a flash of triumph in her eyes. That had clearly been an intentional move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the next second, Evelyn's expression changed to one of worry and apology. She bent down and acted as if she was trying to help Grace up. "Sorry, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could finish speaking, a figure came rushing quickly and picked Grace up. "Are you all right? Is your hand all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her eyes and saw that it was Brian who helped her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was stunned to see Brian&rsquo;s sudden appearance. When... did he come from? Why was he holding Grace right now?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Based on Evelyn's understanding of Brian these days, she naturally knew that this man was by no means a compassionate man. He would not even try to help someone who was about to jump off a building in front of him, let alone help someone whose hand was hit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian touched Grace's smashed left hand as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gasped when he touched her finger. Her brows furrowed subconsciously, and a muffled cry of pain spilled out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian put on a poker face. In the next moment, he picked Grace up in his arms, and told the men who followed behind him, "Call the film crew's doctor to the lounge."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian!" Evelyn cried, confused by the scene before her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was his girlfriend! Why did he pick up Grace instead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian just gave Evelyn a cold look and quickly walked toward the lounge with Grace in his arms.</p></div>
