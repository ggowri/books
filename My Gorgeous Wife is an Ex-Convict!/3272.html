        <h1>Chapter 3270</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, actually he is very happy that she is willing to protect him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just wondering, when will he be able to protect her too? He doesn't want to be the only one being protected, he hopes that one day he can also protect her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, Jason asked his daughter, "Did you go to the hospital with Lawrence today and miss your piano lesson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Jasper replied, "Lawrence was bullied at school today and someone took the watch that William gave him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she said this, she still had an angry expression on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, what do you want to do?" calmly asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daddy, can you make sure Lawrence isn't bullied at school?" Jasper asked. "I don't want to see him get bullied anymore. I promised him that I would protect him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Jason's eyes flickered slightly and he asked, "Protection? Has he reached the point where you feel the need to protect him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper didn't understand the meaning behind his father's words and simply said, "Lawrence is my friend. He was being bullied, so of course I had to protect him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But the words 'protect' cannot be used lightly towards others," Jason said. "Unless that person is very important to you, don't easily protect someone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked in confusion, "Lawrence is important to me. I want to participate in piano competitions with him in the future. He will only get better at playing the piano!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes were filled with anticipation for Lawrence's future music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing his daughter like this, Jason chuckled, "Since you put it that way, Daddy will help you solve this problem. No one will dare to bully Lawrence in his school anymore, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Daddy!" Jasper happily threw herself into Jason's arms and even kissed him on the cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason gently patted his daughter's head, "I just hope that by then, Lawrence can really handle your protection."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daddy, what do you mean?" Jasper was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason smiled, "You'll understand when you're a little older."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Jasper fell asleep, Jason returned to the bedroom and talked to Grace about the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace furrowed her brows, seemingly deep in thought. After a moment, she said, "Let's help Lawrence for now. After all, he's still a child. It's just that Wilona..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's not well-behaved," Jason smiled slightly. "Helping someone like her too much may not be a good thing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence is a good kid, but his parents are always scheming," said Grace, a lawyer who has met all kinds of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she hasn't had much contact with Lawrence's parents, having only met them a few times, she has been able to discern their character to some extent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, when Wilona brought Lawrence, who was injured, to learn the piano, Jason and Grace could see the scheme behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A little scheming is fine, but if they think they can do whatever they want because they have the Reed family as their backing, that's not right," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What should we do about this?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since Jasper has already agreed to it, I'll take care of it. But we still need to give the Abbott family a little push," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace sighed with some concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just hope Lawrence and Jasper can really be friends and not develop any resentment because of his parents' actions," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She actually likes Lawrence, feeling that he is a good and innocent kid.</p></div>
