        <h1>Chapter 3776</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, you saw it?" Veronica said nervously. "It's more noticeable at the company entrance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Mason ask you to hide your relationship?" Daniel said. "Maybe he doesn't want to go public, maybe he's just playing with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, Daniel!" Veronica said displeased. "The relationship between me and my boyfriend is our private matter. I hope you don't make unfounded comments."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm doing this for your own good!" Daniel said angrily. "What kind of person is Mason? Do you really think he will marry you? Families like the Reed family only marry those who are of equal status. Besides, do you really think Mason is sincere to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the Reed family is like and how Mason treats me are my own business!" Veronica retorted bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason could have left you back then, causing you to struggle and work hard to earn a living. After he returned to the country, it didn't take long for him to be with you again. Don't you think the timing is too coincidental?" Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you trying to say?" Veronica frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, Mason may be with you now to get revenge on you. I heard that you broke up with him back then, and you had a dispute with him before he went abroad. You also moved away from your family and lived alone in your current place. Later, the Barlow family fell from grace in the business world, and all the benefits that the Reed family gave you were gone. Now, your father seems to be worried about business matters all the time," Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was surprised. Did Daniel investigate her and Mason's past?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He investigated them?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daniel, what is your purpose?" Veronica asked. If he had no purpose, why would he investigate these things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What purpose could I have? I just don't want you to be hurt," Daniel said. "Veronica, I was hurt because of Mason before, so now I don't want you to be hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Veronica's expression softened. "I have decided to be with Mason. I don't want to bring up the past, and whether or not I will be hurt is my own business. Daniel, I appreciate your concern, but this is my private matter. I hope you won't interfere anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's face turned extremely unpleasant, and Veronica didn't say anything else. She turned and walked into the company building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The company matter wasn't actually that urgent, and the supervisor didn't say it had to be dealt with today. In other words, she could come to the company tomorrow to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why did Daniel call and make it sound so urgent? Veronica wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way back, she looked at her reflection in the subway window. She had actually thought about the possibility that Mason was suddenly with her for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the timing was too coincidental, and Mason's attitude towards her had </span><span>changed quite quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However...if she thought about her understanding of him from childhood to adulthood, she didn't think he was the type of person to use emotions for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when she had hurt him before, he had chosen hypnosis instead of doing anything to hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could such a person come back and do something cruel to her after a few years?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she didn't believe what Daniel said at all!</span></p></div>
