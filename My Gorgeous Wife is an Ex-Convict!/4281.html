        <h1>Chapter 4279 Mutual Concerns</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can curses and witchcraft really cause such unbearable pain in people?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never known that one could be in such excruciating pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How long would he have to endure this kind of pain? Tina stood outside the door, constantly listening to the faint screams of agony coming from the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body seemed to be filled with a wave of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Chandler who was supposed to be in pain, so why was she feeling it too?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation of pain seemed to be getting stronger and stronger, stabbing at her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stood dumbfounded at the doorway of the room, feeling the waves of pain wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler didn't know how long he had been in pain. He had passed out at one point due to the pain but then woke up again because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was a mess, the blood on his palms had dried up. The pain from the wounds slowly brought him back to consciousness and reminded him of what had happened last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, Tina had come, and she had entered this room, witnessing his most vulnerable state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And last night, he had almost disregarded Tina's wishes and forced himself upon her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, he hadn't!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler lowered his gaze to his palm covered in wounds. He had pierced his palm with broken glass yesterday, managing to push Tina out of the room just enough to maintain a shred of sanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had truly ignored Tina's wishes and forced himself upon her, he would never forgive himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler took a deep breath and opened the door, stepping out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to freshen up and tend to the wounds in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, he froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was leaning against the wall next to the door, her eyes closed, as if she had fallen asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was she still here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why hadn't she gone back to the Stephenson family and stayed here instead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that she...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler suddenly felt anxious and quickly crouched down to check on Tina, afraid that something might have happened to her and she had passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was startled awake by Chandler's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler?" Tina looked at him and softly called his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you?" Chandler anxiously looked at Tina. "Are you feeling unwell? I'll take you to the hospital now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about you?" Tina asked in response. "Are you still in pain? Oh, your hand..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly reached out and grabbed his wrist, then saw the scars in his palm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's face turned pale in an instant. While she had thought that his wounds might be severe from grabbing the glass barehanded and losing so much blood, she was still surprised by the extent of the injuries in his palm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did it get so serious? You...you..." The rest of her words got stuck in her throat, and tears kept rolling down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, it's just a minor injury. It looks worse than it actually is!" Chandler quickly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina choked up, looking at him with teary eyes. "Back then, you were in so much pain, why did you still...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want to hurt you," he said. "I was almost losing my sanity at that time, and the parasite inside me was craving you. If I didn't do that, you might have been..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina almost instinctively tried to say it was okay.</span></p></div>
