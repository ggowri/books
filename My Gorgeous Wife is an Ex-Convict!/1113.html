        <h1>Chapter 1112</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, sometimes, everything could change in an instant&mdash;just like when they broke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only that time, it was he who wanted to break up. This time, it was she who wanted to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I really should get over you this time," murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina planned to head over to Grace's rental house to see her as soon as she got off work the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although they had talked on the phone yesterday and Grace said she was alright, Lina was still a little worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a figure stopped in front of her when she came to the parking lot to get her car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must be Lina," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a woman wearing a new outfit from multiple luxury brands' fall collections. She wore elaborate makeup and was looking haughtily at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. "Who are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Elizabeth Jackson, the one Hadwin Stephenson is going to marry. I heard you've been with Hadwin for a while, so I wanted to meet you. What do you think? Why don't we go somewhere and talk?" she said. It was a question, but her tone was more like an order that had no room for rejection. Her eyes were full of disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina raised her eyebrows. 'Marry... Um, why didn't Hadwin Stephenson tell me about it? Is this a situation where my rival in love is trying to show me who's the boss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wait a minute. This woman doesn't seem to be my rival in love.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina made all sorts of speculations in her head, temporarily ignoring Elizabeth Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson had never suffered such treatment. If it were not for her next plan, she would have turned around and left by now. She would not waste her time on this seemingly ordinary woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea what Hadwin Stephenson saw in this woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, do you want to talk or not?" Elizabeth Jackson said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure. Let's just go to the coffee shop next to my office, but it's your treat," said Lina. Lina was not going to split the bill for those who came looking for trouble and save them money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The disdain in Elizabeth Jackson's eyes grew stronger. She found that Lina was indeed someone too embarrassing to show in public. She would even fuss over the price of a cup of coffee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it. Lead the way," said Elizabeth Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina shrugged and led the way, trying to figure out what the marriage was all about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the coffee shop, Lina bluntly ordered a cup of expensive coffee for herself and listened to Elizabeth Jackson as she spoke in a superior tone. "I looked into you. You're just a designer in a small design firm from an ordinary family background. Don't you think you're unworthy of Hadwin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would I date him if I felt that way?" Lina said as she curled her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson was stunned by Lina's words. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, what&rsquo;s your family background and what do you do?" asked Lina. After all, one would prevail in every battle if one knew oneself and one&rsquo;s enemy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm the daughter of the boss of Four Seas Property, and I'm also the marriage partner decided by the Stephenson family. Soon, Hadwin and I will be engaged and then married. Therefore, if you're smart, you'd better leave before things get embarrassing," said Elizabeth Jackson as she raised her chin.</p></div>
