        <h1>Chapter 3193</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come here." Brian reached out his hand to Valda, with a gentle smile on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was a little stunned and for a moment, she forgot to walk towards him and hold his hand. She just stood there foolishly, looking at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised an eyebrow slightly and took the initiative to walk up to her, holding her hand and asking, "What's wrong? You didn't react when I called you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did she suddenly come back to her senses and replied nervously, "I just think you're too good-looking... and I got stunned."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The curve of his lips became even more pronounced. "Oh? That's my honor. I can make my lady stunned."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The word "lady" spoken from his mouth made her blush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When we start shooting later, there will probably be a lot of women crowding around you to watch," she said. His appearance was indeed very attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter how many people are watching, as long as you're looking at me, that's all that matters," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Valda felt her cheeks getting even hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at the tree, Valda looked at the big tree where they first met. For a moment, she felt overwhelmed with emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Valda wanted to recreate the scene of their first meeting, Brian stood under the tree while Valda slowly approached him with an umbrella in hand, offering it to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only difference this time was that he took the umbrella she handed him and they smiled at each other under it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's lips curved into a smile, and in that moment, she forgot about the photographer taking pictures and the people watching around her. It was as if her eyes only saw him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was meant to be this way, that one glance could last a lifetime. That initial look made her unable to forget this man, which is why she would occasionally think of him later on. So when he asked to be in a relationship, it was only natural for her to agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The filming is still ongoing, and more and more people are starting to gather around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Brian had arranged several bodyguards to block the crowd around him, it gradually turned into a mob, and even the police were called in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people there took out their phones and started recording the scene, and some even recognized Brian's identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my, what's going on? The prince is actually taking wedding photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you shooting some kind of advertisement?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is that possible? Have you ever seen the prince do an advertisement for anyone before? And this woman, isn't she the same girlfriend that the prince himself admitted to before? She even did a live broadcast before!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is the prince taking wedding photos with this woman? Are they getting married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were various discussions and opinions. Soon after, many posts about today's wedding photo shoot even appeared online. During the break, when Valda and Brian got on the RV, Camille called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sister, congratulations, you're trending again! But the way you looked in your wedding photos today was really beautiful! Especially when you were standing next to Brian, it felt like I was watching a romantic drama," said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did it trend?" Valda exclaimed in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly, why don't you go take a look yourself later? It's currently trending at number ten, but I don't think it'll be long before it jumps straight to number one," said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ending the call, Valda quickly browsed the web and found the news about her wedding photoshoot today. It had already become a hot topic and had risen to the ninth place in the rankings.</p></div>
