        <h1>Chapter 3118</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I may not be as kind as you," Amber's eyes flickered, "I heard from Kyla that you chose to give the only chance of escape to Grace's child in order to save him. Many people find it difficult to give others a chance to live and leave the possibility of death to themselves. I have never been able to do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Amber spoke, her expression seemed to be lost in some kind of memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, when the car accident happened, her mind was blank and she instinctively closed her eyes. But... Herman Moss used his life to protect her and let her survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Herman hadn't protected her at that time, the one who survived now would have been Herman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Amber, what's wrong? What are you thinking about?" Valda's voice interrupted Amber's thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber smiled, "Just thinking about someone who loves me very much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, in Valda's puzzled gaze, she added, "My husband, Herman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda had heard Brian and Grace mention Herman before and knew that he was the one who saved Amber in the car accident. Unfortunately, Herman died in the process, and Amber was caught up in a media storm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Simon's father..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's a stranger. The only relationship between us is Simon. To me, he's just Simon's father, nothing more." Amber said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When it came to George, there was no emotion left in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda couldn't help but sigh. Even the strongest feelings would eventually fade away, wouldn't they?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, I envy you." Amber said, "You've experienced life and death, but now you can come back to life and be with the one you love. But for me, I can never be with the person who loved me deeply. If one day you face this regret, you will realize that everything else is not a regret."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was stunned, feeling as if Amber's eyes could see through her hesitation and self-doubt at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated for a moment and murmured, "But if I selfishly choose to be with that person, and later that person becomes the subject of ridicule and mockery because of me, and when I become a stain on his reputation, wouldn't that be regrettable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what? If you only care about what others think, don't you think you'll live a tiring life?" Amber said, raising her gloved right hand. "During the time when I had just come out of the mental hospital, I also lived a very tiring life. Many people would point and talk about me, even when I came to live and work in Emerald City, this situation still existed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During that time, I was exhausted both physically and mentally. However, one day I had an epiphany: I shouldn't care about what others think and just focus on living my own life. So, I worked hard to improve myself and my life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, there are still rumors and gossip around me, but there are also people who support me. They don't look down on me because of my past experiences and my disability. So you see, things can get better, right? How things are now doesn't necessarily mean how they will be in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber honestly shared her experience with Valda, perhaps because she had once lost happiness and didn't want this kind and gentle woman like Herman to lose happiness too.</p></div>
