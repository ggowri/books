        <h1>Chapter 3364</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin approached Lina, and one hand wrapped around her waist. "Alright, now tell me, how did you get this photo album?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um..." Lina had to confess honestly, "I bought it from a scalper." She couldn't get it otherwise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A scalper?" Hadwin couldn't help but laugh, "How much did you pay for it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I added...um, 3800. You have no idea how difficult it was to bargain. The scalper had raised the price so high, but I managed to negotiate and bring it down by 200 yuan. The original price was 4000 yuan, can you believe it? It wasn't easy for me to chase after a celebrity like this." As Lina continued speaking, she began to ramble on about the difficulties of bargaining.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina tends to digress into other topics while speaking, and this trait has actually been inherited by Lina as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're quite generous, letting the scalpers earn 3800 from you for Hubery," said Hadwin in a soft tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina suddenly stopped talking and looked at her husband like that. Could it be... he's jealous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, it was just a small amount of money," Lina said sheepishly. "I promise, I won't spend money on Hubery anymore. From now on, the only man I'll let spend money on me is my husband!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" He stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought for a moment, then licked her lips and added, "And my dad too, hehe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her appearance and felt helpless again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After being married for many years, how could he not see that she was just trying to coax him with her words? She wanted him to stop spending money on those idols in the future, which was simply too difficult!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he also didn't want to deprive her of that little bit of fun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, that's the complete Lina, right? She's a fan of celebrities, she's clever in her own way, sometimes she says surprising things, and other times she stubbornly throws tantrums... Whether it's what he loves about her or what makes him angry, he can't bear to erase that part of her true personality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Promise me that if you ever become a fan of someone, you won't hide it from me or secretly collect photo albums. If I catch you doing it again, I'll have everything sold online," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I promise, I promise, I won't hide anything from you in the future," Lina quickly said, and hugged her dear husband's neck with both hands. She stood on her tiptoes and gave him two big kisses on his cheek, "I knew my husband is the best, so generous and understanding! I'm so lucky to have you as my husband, it's like a blessing from several lifetimes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time. However, he felt quite pleased with the flattery from his wife!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the living room, Tina looked at Chandler pitifully and said, "Chandler, would you take me to the Sleeping Cat exhibition?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, as long as Chandler agrees, then Mom and Dad will definitely agree in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler looked at the pitiful figure in front of him, with dark eyes that now seemed to have a layer of watery sheen. "I didn't let you go to the exhibition to teach you a lesson. Next time, think before you act and don't rush into a fight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I didn't act without thinking. I thought it through before rushing up there. Besides, didn't I also ask Jasmine to call for help?" she muttered quietly.</p></div>
