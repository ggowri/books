        <h1>Chapter 3964</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Nancy was about to leave, Irene suddenly asked, "The last thing you said to that man, was it because of Mick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy paused and squinted at Irene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... the thing about you and Mick dating, it's true, right? I read in the news that Mick was the mastermind behind getting Clarissa imprisoned," Irene said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No comment," Nancy replied with just this simple sentence. Her relationship with Irene was nothing more than ordinary colleagues, and she had no intention of sharing her personal life with Irene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you're good enough for Mick?" Irene asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I'm good enough or not is between him and me, and has nothing to do with others," Nancy replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know? The ugly duckling will always be an ugly duckling in the end. They think they've turned into a swan, but in the end, they're just a joke," Irene looked at Nancy firmly and suddenly said, "Nancy, you will also be a joke in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene's gaze was a bit cold, completely different from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This coldness made Nancy feel a little uneasy in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Irene, I don't think I need you to judge me. Whether I'm an ugly duckling or a swan is not for others to decide!" Nancy finished speaking and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene stared at Nancy's back with a cold look on her face, full of undisguised jealousy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to be a joke, so... Nancy will definitely be a joke too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Definitely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick looked at the obvious handprint on Nancy's face and asked calmly, "Who did this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Francis," Nancy replied. Anyway, even if she didn't say anything, he would be able to find </span><span>out quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you put medicine on it?" Mick raised his hand and gently touched the swollen mark on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I passed," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Francis was looking for you, about Clarissa's matter?" he asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You refused to let Clarissa go," this was not a question, but a statement. After all, if she had agreed, there wouldn't be a handprint on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa killed my mother and almost killed me. Why should I let her go?" Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick smirked. "An eye for an eye, not bad. We really are alike in this aspect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Nancy heard this, her heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alike? He also believes in an eye for an eye. Would he forgive her if he found out about her deception?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy stared at the person in front of her, suddenly feeling an urge to confess everything to him, to tell him about her use of him and hope that he could forgive her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, what's wrong with you?" Mick's voice rang in her ear again, interrupting her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing," she came back to her senses and forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dark peach blossom eyes stared at her, making Nancy suddenly feel guilty, as if his gaze could see through all her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have any troubles or difficulties, you can tell me. There's no need to hide anything. I promised to protect you, and I meant it. I hope our relationship can be closer, but not in a physical way. I want you to feel comfortable around me, without any burden," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned, only hearing him continue, "Sometimes, you always seem to have a heavy heart in front of me, making me feel like you're close, but also far away from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Nancy opened her mouth, but the rest of her words seemed to be stuck in her throat, unable to come out.</span></p></div>
