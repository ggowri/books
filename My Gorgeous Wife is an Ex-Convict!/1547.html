        <h1>Chapter 1545</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His tone was relaxed and casual, but there was something menacing and bloody about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace readily replied, "Okay! I won't let go even if you break my hands. But Jay... I hope one day, you&rsquo;ll also promise me not to let go of me. After all..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked at their hands. "After all, we&rsquo;re both in this together, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a slight movement in his fingers, and he felt an impulse to squeeze her hand...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason eventually ate the food Grace had brought upstairs. However, the way she smiled at him with her chin in her hands while he ate made him a little uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not that he had never been stared at by women, but he could not help feeling his blood flow quickening when she looked at him. When had a woman's gaze ever brought upon such an effect on him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At night, Grace went back to her old bedroom, which was connected with Jason's bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">To her surprise, the room was still the same as when she had last been here. Even the clothes in her closet were still there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could see that people had been cleaning the room. It was clean and tidy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many things had happened today, and Grace was indeed a little tired. She soon fell asleep after washing up with her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The night gradually darkened, and a figure approached the bedside. Those dark peach blossom eyes looked at the big and small figures who were sound asleep in bed. The moonlight shone through the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two faces looked so similar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were... his wife and daughter. He had no idea of their existence before today, but they showed up in his life, alive and well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes followed Grace's face to her hands, which were hanging outside the covers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were indeed not beautiful, and one could even call them ugly because of the slight distortion of the joints. However, it was as if he could not help looking at them. There would be bursts of pain in his heart as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He slowly leaned over, his eyes landing on her face again. He almost whispered, "You don&rsquo;t want me to let you go? But do you know you won't have the opportunity to leave me if so? Even when you die, you can only die by my side. Do you still want me not to let you go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was still sound asleep. The quiet sleeping face put him in a trance...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Jason came downstairs the next day, he saw the two children eating breakfast while Grace was busy helping them with the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two kids ate with relish. Grace looked up and saw Jason coming down, so she said, "Come. Let's have breakfast together. I was going to ask you to come down if you still hadn&rsquo;t appeared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at the breakfast on the table. It was different than usual. "This breakfast..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young Madam got up early in the morning to prepare it," explained Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace brought out the breakfast she had prepared for Jason. "Try it and see if it's to your taste."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared at the breakfast before him. They were cartoon-shaped steamed buns with other side dishes that made it look like there was a zoo on his plate. 'Is this what... I'm eating for breakfast?'</p></div>
