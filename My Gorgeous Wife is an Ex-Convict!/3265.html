        <h1>Chapter 3263</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um... I'm just in the very early stages of pregnancy," Valda couldn't help but say. In other words, besides morning sickness, there hasn't been much change. The baby in her belly is probably not even the size of a soybean yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that you're pregnant, more people need to take care of you for me to feel at ease," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sentence "Now that you're pregnant" was the most advantageous reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda suddenly felt that maybe during her pregnancy, he would protect her like a panda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, Valda realized that she had underestimated Brian's determination to protect her like a panda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was at home, he almost followed her every move, and when she was working in the studio, there was also a caregiver with her to take care of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The studio and home were filled with various snacks that helped her stop vomiting. As long as she mentioned wanting to eat something, it would appear in front of her within an hour, without fail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they went to the hospital for check-ups, Brian was even more attentive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, he chose a well-known private hospital in Emerald City, which was famous not only for its advanced medical technology and equipment, but also for its protection of patient privacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people who come here for medical treatment are not wealthy, and the obstetrics department of this hospital is quite famous. Many female celebrities from Emerald City choose to give birth here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Valda was doing her check-up here, she encountered no less than three highly famous pregnant actresses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, being born in the entertainment industry, these female stars know her well and are naturally very polite to her. Especially when they see Brian, who has always been by her side, they even feel a bit envious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the bathroom, Valda vomited for quite a while before finally stopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked over to the sink, rinsed her mouth and wiped the corners of her lips. As she walked out, she happened to see a woman chatting with Brian, seemingly trying hard to get his attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Brian had a cold expression and showed no intention of chatting with the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian saw Valda come out, he quickly walked up to her and greeted her, "How are you feeling? Are you still uncomfortable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda shook her head, "Better now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Would you like to have a sour plum?" Brian asked. These days, she prefers sour food, and eating sour things helps alleviate her morning sickness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda shook her head and said, "Let's eat after the blood test is done." As she spoke, she looked towards the woman who was just talking to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is a young and pretty woman wearing a loose dress and a hat. She is also holding a pair of sunglasses in her hand, which she probably wore before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This woman, Valda often sees her on TV dramas, her name is Maggie, she is a TV actress. She started as a supporting role, but later became the lead in every drama. However, recently there have been rumors online that she is unmarried and pregnant, but this actress has not clarified anything, so the situation remains unclear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, seeing Maggie here again, wearing a loose dress, Valda is starting to suspect that the online gossip is true.</p></div>
