        <h1>Chapter 3077</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian held Valda and left Camille's apartment on his own, quickly walking down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A black sedan is waiting downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He carried her into the car and instructed the driver in the front seat to go to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the way, he gave orders to his subordinates to arrange for experts to consult with Valda at the hospital later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was nervously tugging at her skirt hem when Brian's hand covered hers. "Don't worry, I've got everything under control!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lifted her head and met his ink-black phoenix eyes, which were filled with nothing but her in that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, don't worry. Whatever happens, I will help you solve it. Just stay by my side and I will do everything to protect you in the future!" He spoke with such assurance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's nose feels sour and her eyes are slowly becoming moist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly lowered her head, avoiding his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And he, all along the way, held her hand tightly without ever letting go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car arrived at the hospital, Brian carried Valda out of the car and brought her to the examination room. Experts from the orthopedic and neurology departments of the hospital began to diagnose Valda's condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda took a video and underwent an MRI, but the final expert consultation result was disappointing, as Grace was the cause of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, Mr. Hart. Miss Theller has several nerves in her leg that have already died. Additionally, her leg had a previous fracture and was immobilized with a cast, but it seems that the doctor at the time did not handle it properly. As a result, her leg bone healed crookedly. If we were to perform surgery on her leg now, the outcome may not be good and there would be a significant risk. It's possible that her lower leg may completely die, and amputation would be the only option."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expert doctor spoke to Brian, and his face changed color. "Is there no way to cure it?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"With the current medical methods, it is difficult to treat her leg, and at least our hospital cannot achieve such a level," the expert replied, without making any definitive statements."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But the orthopedics department of this hospital is the top orthopedics department in tMason Swansonty. The doctors who consulted with Valda are well-known among orthopedic experts nationwide!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The consultation result is beyond doubt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face became extremely ugly, but Valda smiled slightly at him as if she had already expected it. "It's okay, Brian. I don't rely on my legs to make a living anyway. At least my hands are fine, and I can still draw comics in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian squatted down and said, "Valda, I will find other doctors to help you and find a way to cure your legs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lowered her eyes gently, but she had no hope for her legs anymore. The consultation just now made her understand this fact once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I want to go back." Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, let's go back." He said, holding her again and leaving the hospital.</p></div>
