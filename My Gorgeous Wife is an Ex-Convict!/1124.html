        <h1>Chapter 1123</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because he understood that he was mad!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In cartoons, people who went to prison were bad guys. His mother was the best, so how could she be a bad guy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels looked at Nelson with a subtle look of disgust in her eyes, especially when the child's eyes were just like Kyla Corbyn's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ask your mommy and you'll know whether she has gone to prison," Paisley Daniels's gaze rested on Kyla Corbyn's pale face as she said in feign sincerity, "Kyla, you won't lie to the child, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's heart seemed to feel a prick. Kyla Corbyn's lips trembled as she saw the look on her son's young face. He was begging for an answer, not knowing how to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that you're really free, Miss Daniels!" Grace walked up to Kyla Corbyn and said to Paisley Daniels, "Miss Daniels, you sent a lot of local thugs to make trouble at Kyla's food stall before this. I wonder if the Daniels family is in collusion with these criminal gangs? They're cracking down on the gangs right now. I hope the Daniels family won't deliberately break the law. Maybe someone will end up in jail one day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's face suddenly turned pale, and she stared at Grace. "I was wondering who it was. It turns out it's you! It seems that you're an ex-convict too. Haha. What a great match. An ex-convict lawyer helping an ex-convict in a lawsuit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since seeing Grace at the gala that day, Paisley Daniels had sent someone to investigate Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled faintly. "Yes, I did go to prison. But I was set up, and the law has given me justice by putting the real perpetrator in jail. So isn't it possible that Kyla is innocent too? Miss Daniels, you keep on talking about how others have been to prison. How do you know that you won't go to prison one day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's face suddenly turned red. She only felt that Grace's calm almond-shaped eyes seemed to have seen through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're talking nonsense! If you do that again, I can sue you for slander!" said Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good. We can look into Kyla's case, and perhaps we'll find out whether it was slander," Grace said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels glared at Grace in hatred and looked at Kyla Corbyn. "What a good lawyer you've found! But unfortunately, you're going to lose the custody case! Kyla Corbyn, you've committed a heinous crime by harming an unborn life. You can't wash it away no matter what!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels raised her voice deliberately so that everyone around her could hear her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, some parents and children were already looking this way, and now more had looked over because of Paisley Daniels's shouting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn could not even avoid them even if she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Paisley Daniels finished, she did not even give the toys she intended to give to Nelson. She asked the driver to take them all back to the car and drive away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the pale Kyla Corbyn and the puzzled Nelson, Grace could not help saying, "Let's go home first! We&rsquo;ll just have to let Nelson find out about some things earlier than expected."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they arrived at Kyla Corbyn's current residence, Mrs. Corbyn clenched her teeth when she learned what had happened at the kindergarten&rsquo;s gates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wasn&rsquo;t it enough for Paisley Daniels to harm Kyla once? Is she going to do more harm to her?"</p></div>
