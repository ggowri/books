        <h1>Chapter 3923</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Nancy spoke up, "Mr. Reed, forgive me for being presumptuous, but I don't understand why you're so good to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least in her understanding, Mick was not a sympathetic person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick stared at Nancy, but he didn't understand it himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I'm being good to you?" he asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For me, yes," she said. "Today you saved me in the rain, brought me here, helped me prepare clothes, and even offered to let me stay for the night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then just consider it me occasionally showing some kindness," Mick said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, there was a faint feeling emanating from him that kept people at a distance, as if there was an insurmountable barrier between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy forced a bitter smile and said, "Thank you, Mr. Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps in his eyes, she was nothing more than a toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was just helped out of kindness, but she was delusional about some impossible things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, Mick instructed the servant to take Nancy to the guest room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The clean, tidy, and understated luxury of the guest room was much better than the house she lived in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was even better than Clarissa Schultz's bedroom in the Schultz family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This once again showed Nancy the wealth and power of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just one guest room in Mick's villa was more luxurious than the carefully crafted bedroom of Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wood and lighting fixtures used were all top-of-the-line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy lay down on the soft bed and felt extremely exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, she fell into a deep sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in her dreams, the scene of her mother falling from the building appeared again, as well as the image of her mother dying in bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes were open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this what they mean by "dying with one's eyes open"?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy... my daughter... Nancy..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy suddenly woke up with tears streaming down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room was pitch black and she had forgotten where she was and that her mother had passed away. She was consumed by grief and only wanted to find her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She ran out of the guest room barefoot and walked through the villa, searching... until she opened the door to one of the rooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone was lying on the bed, seemingly asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it her mother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked closer and saw a handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who was this? It wasn't her mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She approached the bed and leaned down to see more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as she got closer, a hand suddenly grabbed her neck. Mick, who had been sleeping on the bed, opened his eyes and asked in a cold voice, "Why are you in my room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had encountered many women who tried to climb into his bed using all sorts of tricks, but he didn't expect her to be one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, he felt disgusted and even considered having her thrown out of the villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then his expression changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Something wet had fallen onto his hand, giving him a damp sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She... was crying?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick paused for a moment, and by the moonlight shining through the window, he finally saw Nancy's tear-stained face and her...empty eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she was looking at him, it seemed like he couldn't be reflected in her eyes.</p></div>
