        <h1>Chapter 4018</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to the doctor's analysis, Nancy's body had suffered too much trauma. Although the development of the fetus was currently stable, if she were to give birth, it would be like risking her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her current physical condition is not enough to give birth to this child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although a miscarriage at this stage would also be a heavy burden on her body, it would be safer than giving birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hearing the doctor's analysis, Jasper felt heavy-hearted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a woman who had never given birth, she understood the significance of a child to a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking that Nancy had barely survived and the child was growing safely in her womb, but now she had to have a miscarriage in this situation, Jasper felt sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miscarriage? Will Nancy agree?" Grace murmured, thinking back to when she was pregnant with triplets and the doctor had advised her to have an abortion as it was not suitable for her to give birth to three children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at that time, she had resolutely chosen to keep her life and refused to have an abortion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy now reminded Grace of herself back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason obviously guessed what his wife was thinking and gently hugged her, saying, "Don't think too much. Having a miscarriage is also for her to live a healthier life. If you really want a child, there will be plenty of opportunities in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But even if we have another child, it won't be this one." Grace said, feeling emotional about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But we all know that if she insists on giving birth to this child, she may very well die on the operating table," Jason said. "As long as we persuade her well, she will understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it really that simple? Grace wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the fact that Nancy could drag Irene to jump off a cliff, she understood that this child had a courage that ordinary people could not match.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A courage to risk everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such a person can be ruthless to others, and even more ruthless to themselves!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go talk to her!" Mick spoke up. "I will make her agree to have an abortion!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Mick finished speaking, he left the conference room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at the back of his elder brother, biting his lip in sadness. He thought he had found Nancy and finally turned the corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why did another obstacle arise?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace was full of worry, with a bad premonition in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mick returned to Nancy's ward, she was already asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat by the bed, quietly watching her sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were many wounds on her body. Even though she was wearing a hospital gown, he could see many bandages wrapped around her collar and ankles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The shocking reports of her injuries in her medical records made him wish he could take her place and suffer this pain for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How did this woman have the courage to jump down?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he treated her that way, why did she still choose to sacrifice herself for him in this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The child...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he found out she was pregnant, he was overjoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He found her and they had a child together, so she would be more willing to be with him again, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her attitude towards the child was a slap in the face for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want this child to have anything to do with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cared about the child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she no longer cared about him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To her, she had already "repaid" him, so she didn't feel guilty towards him anymore. But at the same time, did she have any feelings of care or love towards him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Love... Did she ever love him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On this point, Mick had no confidence at all.</p></div>
