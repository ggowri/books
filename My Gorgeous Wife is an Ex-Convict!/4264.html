        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, this is what I want!" Tina said firmly, looking at the person in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler stiffened, his facial expression turning from pain to numbness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this is truly what you desire, then I agree to the divorce. You can decide when to proceed with the divorce and you can draft the divorce contract. I have no objections," Chandler said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his heart felt as if it had died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's intention now is to completely separate herself from Chandler, and having the child is just her inner kindness, not wanting to see him die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or perhaps, this child will sever the connection between them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Tina said. "I've said everything I wanted to say. Now, do you have something to say to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze held a sense of emptiness. Originally, he wanted to explain to her, to tell her that although he had ulterior motives at the beginning, they had long disappeared when he fell in love with her. The motives no longer mattered to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it seems like there's no need to say those words anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I wanted to say is no longer important. </span><span>So</span><span> I'm leaving!" Chandler said, looking at Tina with deep affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That look made Tina's heart suddenly beat strongly. A wave of sadness unconsciously spread in her chest, and she even subconsciously wanted to hold Chandler's hand, not wanting him to leave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is happening to her? Tina suppressed this inexplicable feeling and said to Chandler, "Alright then, I won't see you off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay..." he replied softly, finally lowering his gaze and walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Chandler left, Tina's body suddenly became limp, and she sat down heavily in a nearby chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her hand, pressing it against her pounding heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is her heartbeat so intense? It kept throbbing, making her feel incredibly uncomfortable as if a sense of sadness was spreading throughout her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this sadness seemed to be caused by Chandler's final gaze towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina suddenly froze, staring at the tear that fell onto the back of her hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she cry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her hand and slowly touched her own cheek, her face already covered in tears!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cried?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she wanted to cry, but it was the instinct of this body to cry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much did the previous her love Chandler? Even though she lost her memories, does the instinct of her body still love Chandler?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, did the previous her know that all of Chandler's goodness towards her was with a purpose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, stop crying, stop crying again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina kept telling herself this in her mind, but tears kept falling, they couldn't be stopped!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lina came to her daughter's room after Chandler left, she was startled by her daughter's tear-stained face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why are you crying? Did you have a fight with Chandler?" Lina asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Chandler left earlier, his face was lifeless, as if he had lost his soul, leaving behind only an empty shell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, her daughter was crying like this again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened between the two of them in the room?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina shook her head, but her tears only flowed more fiercely!</span></p></div>
