        <h1>Chapter 3498</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At one point, he even forbade her from calling Lionel "little brother"!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this considered jealousy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's just my younger brother, but Mason, to me, you're not only a brother, but also the closest person to me!" said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially after he saved her, this feeling became even more apparent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps no one else would dare to face guns and bullets to save her except for him. Because even a slight mistake could cost him his own life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's eyes flickered slightly, his brother... is he also a younger brother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least he is still her closest person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But one day, he may not be her brother anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he truly grows up, will she see him as another half of her life? Will she like him and love him more then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since Veronica believes he didn't have the guts to do it, I also believe it wasn't him who did it. There may be hidden reasons behind it. When we go back, I'll tell Dad and we can bail him out first," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's eyes lit up at his words. "Do you really believe that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, if Veronica believes it, then I naturally believe it too," said Mason. "So Veronica, you can rest assured that Lionel will be fine, and the real mastermind won't escape!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica breathed a sigh of relief. "Mason, thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason stared at her firmly. "You don't need to thank me for someone else's sake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pursed her lips, feeling the hand holding hers getting hotter and hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car arrived at the door of the Reed House, and Mason took Veronica back to the main house. They had dinner with the Reed family, including William, and Veronica was the only non-family member present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Similarly, the Reed family arranged a guest room for William, who reportedly rushed to Emerald City as soon as he heard about Jasper's accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, don't be shy. If you want anything else to eat, just ask," Grace said hospitably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Auntie Grace. I really like all the dishes today, and I will eat more," Veronica replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, eat more! We should cherish the importance of 'safety' after this incident. It's a rare opportunity for us to sit together and have a meal," Jasper sighed. This experience made her realize the true meaning of "safety."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the meal, Mason accompanied Veronica back to her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After being discharged from the hospital and returning to the Barlow family to pick up some things, Veronica was already a bit tired. Mason asked, "Do you want to sleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um," she nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then rest early," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she replied, planning to sleep after he left. However, he stayed in her room and showed no intention of leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, the two of them stared at each other again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Veronica was the first to speak, "Are you... um, not going out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll leave after you fall asleep," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if I can't sleep?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll stay by your side," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression was like that of a loyal and faithful dog, which left her unsure of what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, she went to the bathroom, freshened up, changed into her pajamas, and then walked over to the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you going to lie down?" he asked, looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Well, there was really nothing to be embarrassed about! Veronica thought to herself. He had stayed by her bedside when she was in the hospital, after all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, she had slept with him countless times since they were young! Now, he was just sitting by her side, keeping her company until she fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica then lifted the covers and lay down on the bed.</p></div>
