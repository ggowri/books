        <h1>Chapter 1950</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper was shouting, "Daddy, Daddy, watch me skip!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Jasper skipped with the rubber band rope just like Grace. Out of the corners of his eyes, Jason glanced at William, who was standing nearby as he watched his adorable daughter skip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'The Barlow family of Deer City is looking into Lily. What do they have to do with the boy in front of me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What did Lily have to do with the Barlow family? If Lily had something to do with the Barlow family, given her character, she probably would not have committed suicide in prison but would have used the Barlow family to get even.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Unless she had no idea she had something to do with the Barlow family.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that in mind, contemplation flashed across Jason's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper had just learned this new game, so she accidentally tripped over the rubber band rope. Grace quickly helped the little one get up. She saw that Jasper Reed&rsquo;s pants were scuffed, so she carefully rolled up her daughter's pant legs, thinking the child might have skinned her knees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William and Mick Reed also surrounded Jasper and saw that her fair calves and knees were scratched and even bleeding a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Does it hurt?" asked Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Only a little," Jasper said bravely, but the expression on her little face revealed the pain she felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace treated her daughter's wounds, the little one screamed like a pig being slaughtered. Her almond-shaped eyes that resembled Grace's were teary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's heart broke, and he wished he could take his daughter's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After Grace applied the medicine for her daughter, Mick Reed and William reached out their hands to her face almost at the same time. However, it was Mick Reed's hand that touched her face and wiped away her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Put a mat on the floor when you play Chinese jump rope in the future so you won't hurt yourself when you fall," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William silently withdrew his hand with a flash of disappointment in his eyes. If it was possible, he wished he could wipe her tears away and make her stop crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">aunt Cummins had transferred him to a new kindergarten where no one knew that he was the son of a criminal. They only thought that he was a relative of the Reed family and did not discriminate against him in the kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he still felt like a misfit in the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Many people here would give him strange looks as if reminding him that he was the son of a criminal, and his mother had deeply hurt members of the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, William's tiny body stiffened when he noticed Jason's eyes staring at him. They were both sharp and alert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He felt immobilized as he faced that gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is it because I'm still a kid? Is that why I feel so helpless?' For a moment, William suddenly wished to grow up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he was all grown up, would he not feel so helpless?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, Grace asked Jason, "You seemed to be watching William a lot today, so much so that the child's face was a little pale. What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly, not expecting her to have noticed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you think of William?" asked Jason.</p></div>
