        <h1>Chapter 780</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The corners of her eyes were still dry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now I can't even cry?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe some people in this world were doomed to never receive love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She fell in love with Jason despite suffering the terrible experience of being dumped by Sean!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and he were two worlds apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had not taken him home that night, then there was no way they could have crossed paths.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the end of the day, it was she who had provoked him in the first place and became the subject of a game in the end. Now... it was just making her realize who she was once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Step by step, Grace walked out of the kitchen. Reed Residence was surprisingly quiet right now. It was so quiet that she could not even see the servants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, it's fine. At least&hellip; it'll save me a lot of embarrassment.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to have used up all her strength when she finally returned to her bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mood was completely different from when she left earlier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked up to the dressing mirror and murmured to the woman in the mirror, "It's just... back to square one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The makeup on the face of the woman in the mirror was not ruined. She wore a white dress that made her look unusually pale against her comely face, and her almond-shaped eyes were thick with self-mockery and repressed bitterness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I'm just back to when I was alone, like when I first got out of jail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I just have to live alone and work hard on my own. Even if I have to live at the bottom of the social hierarchy, I have to struggle to survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;There's... nothing to be afraid of. I've experienced this before, haven't I?&rdquo; Grace said to herself. Then, she stood up, opened the wardrobe, and put on the clothes she had taken from the rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was glad she had not thrown these away. At least she could leave with her things and not owe him anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She folded the clothes she changed out of neatly and tidied up the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had brought very little with her after surrendering the rental house. Later, when he bought the house she had lived in before, she kept some of the things that contained her memories in that house into a box and brought it over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, all her belongings were in one large and one small suitcases.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then put the bank cards and jewelry that Jason had given her as well as the title deed to her old house on her dressing table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As far as she was concerned, they had never really belonged to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;That's it. Maybe I'll just leave like this. It's the best ending for me!&rdquo; she said to herself, but just as she was about to leave the room, she paused in her steps. After a moment's hesitation, she pushed open the door which connected the two bedrooms and entered his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With the photo album still on the cabinet, Grace went forward, turned to the last page of the photo album, and pulled out the photo of her in the floral dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since they had broken up, this photo would no longer hold any meaning to him, so she might as well take it back and save the photo from being thrown into a garbage can.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then went back to her bedroom, dragged her two pieces of luggage, and looked around the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were so many memories of her and him in the room. It was as if his scent was still in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... that man would probably have nothing to do with her again.</p></div>
