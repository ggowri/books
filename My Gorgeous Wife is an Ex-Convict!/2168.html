        <h1>Chapter 2166</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the past, his mother did not care even if he got in a fight with someone outside and got bruises all over his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All his mother did was drink, watch TV, and talk about how glamorous she used to be...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Here, why don't I treat your wounds?" Grace took the little one back to his room. Then, she took the medical kit and carefully tended to William's wounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William remained silent as Grace applied the ointment to his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let me know if it hurts." Grace was afraid that she was being a little too forceful, but the little one stayed silent even though it hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William pressed his lips together. For some reason, the pain seemed to diminish... 'Is it because of the ointment? Or... is it because of aunt Cummins?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, William's face was still swollen. Grace thought of letting the little one skip kindergarten for a few days until his wounds recovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, William insisted on going to kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Grace had no choice but to send him there. She told the kindergarten teacher to pay more attention to the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">During recess, a teacher came to the bed William was napping on and patted him gently, hinting him to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William got out and followed the teacher out of the nap room with a puzzled look on his face. Then, he went into a room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the room, he once again saw the man who claimed to be his father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow instantly felt upset when he saw the bruises on his son, even though the current situation would help him bring the little one back to the Barlow family. After all, the more miserable he was in the Reed family, the more willing he would be to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he still felt an indescribable pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is it because the child is mine? Is it because he's my only son?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You look so ugly right now. Were you beaten by the children of the Reed family's servants?" asked Philip Barlow. Although he was not in the Reed family, he knew what he ought to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William watched him warily like a guarded kitten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You have a bad reputation in the Reed family&rsquo;s house right now. Everyone said you pushed Nelson Corbyn down the stairs. Even if you said it wasn't you, no one believed you, right?" said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A hint of gloom flashed across William's eyes, which were similar to Philip Barlow's. Then, his nervousness and wariness turned into frustration. He lowered his little head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even the servants' children dare to beat you up now. It's because they think you're no better than they are." Philip Barlow crouched down and looked straight at his son, saying, "But if you're the Barlow family's heir, someone with the same status as Jasper and Mick Reed, who would have the guts to treat you like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one shivered a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He asked, "Do you want to stay with the Reed family or return to the Barlow family with me? Once you return to the Barlow family, no one will dare to look down on you again, let alone call you the son of a criminal!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William slowly raised his head and looked blankly at the person in front of him. What he said was tempting him to say yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not want to be despised or looked down upon again, let alone hear people call him a criminal just because he was the child of a criminal.</p></div>
