        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Afterward, when Mick and Nancy were alone, Mick asked, "Are you envious of Jasper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What?" Nancy was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "When William said he wanted to dance with Jasper, you had an envious expression on your face. Do you want to see it too?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Was she really envious at that time? Nancy thought to herself, "No, I just thought the childhood sweethearts feeling between Jasper and William was really nice and warm. I would like our daughter to have a childhood sweetheart like that in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Then find one for her," Mick smiled and said, "If Sophia wants a childhood sweetheart in the future, she will definitely have one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Are you so sure?" Nancy was curious about Mick's confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "There are many people who want to connect with the Reed family. In the future, when we take Sophia to attend some events, there will be many boys of similar age around her," Mick said, "But which ones are sincere and which ones are fake, she will have to discern for herself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Nancy immediately understood that with the background of the Reed family, there would be many people trying to get close to their daughter in the future. Naturally, those boys of similar age would use this opportunity to get closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Among them, there would be many people with ulterior motives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Have you experienced all of this before?" Nancy couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Mick smiled faintly, "Just get used to it. After all, these things are always unavoidable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although he said it lightly, Nancy felt a kind of indescribable heaviness in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Considering his status and position, there must have been many people who deliberately approached him when he was young, wanting to use him. He may have even been deceived and used.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So when she used him and deceived him in the past, was that why he hated her so much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm sorry," Nancy murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What do you have to apologize for?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I also..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Before she could finish her sentence, his fingertips pressed against her lips. "Between us, there's no need for apologies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I hope Sophia will meet someone who truly loves her in the future," Nancy murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "She definitely will. She's our daughter, and she'll surely meet someone who truly loves her," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The two embraced each other, while their little baby slept soundly in the crib next to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When Tina handed Eugenia Kit's autograph, Eugenia screamed as if she had received a precious treasure. She stuck the autograph tightly to her chest and said with a fanatical expression, "It's great! Sister finally got Kit's autograph! I feel like I can die without regrets now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you really have no regrets?" Tina looked at her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Uh, maybe... there's still a little regret. I still want to go to Kit's concert and maybe shake his hand. Of course, if he could give me a hug or something, then I would probably have no regrets," Eugenia thought for a moment and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You have a lot of thoughts," Tina teased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Hehe, people need to think more to live with more motivation. Unlike you, who has such a handsome fianc&eacute;," Eugenia said. "But speaking of which, when you asked Kit for his autograph, did your guy get jealous?"</p></div>
