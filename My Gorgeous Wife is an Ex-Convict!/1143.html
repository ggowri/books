        <h1>Chapter 1142</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I almost didn't make it." The voice that was like a night breeze rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head and saw Brian standing right behind her. "Why did you get on the bus?" she asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I still want to send you home. Since you won't take my car, I'll take the bus with you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. Perhaps she had never expected Brian to take the bus with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please pay when you get on board," reminded the driver as he pulled out of the bus station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian fumbled in his pocket. He pulled out a 100-dollar bill and planned to throw it into the farebox. After all, the only small change he had was in that denomination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait"! Grace quickly stopped Brian. "Are you going to put in 100 dollars?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only have 100 dollars," Brian said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips a little. "Forget it. I'll pay for you. You can put your money away." With that, she took her monthly travel pass card and tapped it on the farebox machine before walking toward the middle of the bus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not yet rush hour, and the bus was relatively empty, but there were no seats left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found a suitable position and stood, grabbing the bar on the back of a seat while Brian stood beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, I haven't taken the bus for a long time. I&rsquo;m experiencing it again today," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to send me home. I'm used to being alone and don't need anyone to send me home," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really used to being alone? Or are you just not used to me sending you home?" he asked, looking at her with those dark phoenix eyes that seemed to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and turned away, avoiding his eyes. "Brian, don't waste your time on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes fluttered a little at that. His pretty thin lips raised a self-deprecating smile. "Yeah, I&rsquo;ve wasted a lot of time, and I've decided not to waste any more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, he once again said, "Grace, shall we wait and see? Am I going to waste my whole life without getting a response? Or will you respond to me one day? Then all the time won't be wasted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." She jerked her head around, glaring at him with those almond-shaped eyes. "Is that necessary?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He replied emphatically, "Yes, it is! Otherwise, I may regret it for the rest of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had let her go more than once because of Jason and regretted it! If he had recognized how his heart truly felt and not let her go, could she have fallen in love with him instead of Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had let her go, and Jason had left a mark in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He regretted it. He regretted giving in and retreating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He always thought he was waiting for the girl in his memory, but he never realized what he really wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already too late when he realized who he loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought it would be his lifelong regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she broke up with Jason after that. It was then he told himself that he must not let himself regret it again this time.</p></div>
