        <h1>Chapter 104</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the ward, it was almost silent except for the sound of chewing. Neither the grandfather nor the grandson had said anything to each other.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although the nurse who picked up the food for the Old Master was curious, she didn't dare to ask. After all, these two were the most powerful people in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, after Old Mr. Reed was almost full, he said, "I heard that you haven't stayed in the house for the past few days?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," Jason replied indifferently. He was not surprised that Old Master knew about this. After all, Old Master had his informants everywhere, even in his house.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Where are you staying?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Outside," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why do you want to stay outside?" Old Mr. Reed asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's too quiet in the house." He pretended to be casual as he picked up a shrimp and slowly peeled off the shell.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Speaking of which, you should have a girlfriend at your age. I will ask my secretary to sort out information about the famous young ladies in the city. You can pick one." Old Mr. Reed's tone sounded as if it was as simple as picking out clothes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's fingers, which were holding on to the shrimp, paused slightly. Then he replied, "There's no need."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Old Mr. Reed narrowed his eyes. "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If it's only to find a woman to give birth to a child, then I can choose my own candidate," he said. In the past, he felt that if he was destined to have a child who would inherit the Reed family in the future, then it didn't matter which woman gave birth to the child.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, he felt that if he needed a child, he hoped that the child's mother could be Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed not bad for the child to inherit his and her blood and genes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"A candidate?" Old Mr. Reed was shocked. "Could it be that you..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Jason's mobile phone suddenly rang. He was slightly startled and took out a cheap mobile phone from his pocket. Looking at the caller ID on it, he immediately stood up and answered the call. However, when he heard the voice on the other end of the phone, his face suddenly changed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay... save... save me..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though her voice was hoarse and shattered, he could still immediately tell that this was Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, before he could ask, the call was hung up. Then, he dialed again, but the voice message informed him that he could not get through.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Did something happen to Grace?" Even he himself didn't know that at this moment, his face was deathly pale under the light. He then said to Old Mr. Reed, "Grandfather, I still have some matters to attend to. I have to leave now."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After that, he rushed out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A hint of haze appears on Old Mr. Reed's face. The expression on his grandson's face made him feel as if he had seen his son's appearance over that woman back then.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">For that woman, his son did not hesitate to betray his family and abandon his glory and wealth. But in the end, what had happened to him?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If a man loves a woman too much, it's destined to end in tragedy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And now, what kind of woman would make Jason lose his composure?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had not expected these relatives to drug her. Although she did not drink wine at dinner, she drank some soft drinks. Now she was weak and had no strength at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grandma wanted to stop them, but she was stopped by the third aunt, while the uncles carried her to see the Miller family.</p></div>
