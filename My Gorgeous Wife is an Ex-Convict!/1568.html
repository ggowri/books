        <h1>Chapter 1566</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how one looked at them, they did not seem to have anything to do with each other!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina slowly came back to her senses, naturally understanding that Holly Greer only intended to trample on her to get some sense of pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Holly Greer had a lot to say when she was dating Hadwin Stephenson back then. She even knew that Holly Greer had said behind her back that Hadwin Stephenson would dump her sooner or later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she returned to the office and Holly Greer learned that she had indeed broken up with Hadwin Stephenson, she gloated, "See, I knew it. How could someone like Hadwin Stephenson date you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it true?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina did not think so. No matter what... she thought Hadwin Stephenson really did love her when they were dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she did not have a strong family background and could not give him what he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But it's a pity that Lina has broken up with Hadwin Stephenson. Otherwise, Lina would have been the wife of the chairman of Stephenson Group right now." Holly Greer continued to make snarky remarks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could not wait to step on Lina further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at her coldly and then suddenly smiled. "If you feel sorry for me, then go to Hadwin Stephenson and help us make up so that you&rsquo;ll stop expressing your pity for me in front of our colleagues. You make it seem like I&rsquo;m betraying your trust if I don't get back together with Hadwin Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once Lina said this, Holly Greer's expression immediately changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The other colleagues had also come to their senses. They looked at Holly Greer strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Holly Greer felt a little uncomfortable from their gazes. She could only smile drily and go back to her office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina returned to her seat and pulled out her phone. She intended to send a message to her blind date tonight to confirm the time and place for their meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she could not help searching for news about Hadwin Stephenson in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It had been five years. In these five years, she had tried hard not to think about Hadwin Stephenson or read his news. She wanted to get over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she just realized that maybe she was not over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Some of the latest news regarding Hadwin Stephenson popped out on the webpage. Sure enough, like what Holly Greer just said, Hadwin Stephenson had come to Emerald City. The one accompanying Hadwin Stephenson was Katherine Jackson, the true heiress of the Jackson family. The Jackson family found her five years ago and she returned to the Jackson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was the Jackson family that helped Hadwin Stephenson successfully turn the tables around. He regained control of the Stephenson family and Stephenson Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She thought Hadwin Stephenson would marry Katherine Jackson soon after he broke up with her. However, it had been five years. Hadwin Stephenson and Katherine Jackson had not married and continued to date.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It had led to speculation about how long it would take for the couple to tie the knot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina silently looked at Hadwin Stephenson&rsquo;s photos in the news articles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He wore a black suit, and his somewhat baby face was as beautiful as ever. It was just that the years had given him a touch of maturity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Standing next to him, Katherine Jackson was gorgeous and alluring. The tight red dress highlighted her stunning figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'They do make a good match in these photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He... finally got what he wanted.' Lina gently smiled. It was bitter and full of dejection. She had become history to him.</p></div>
