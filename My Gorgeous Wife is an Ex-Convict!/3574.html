        <h1>Chapter 3572</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the other party heard Jasper, a little girl, speak, their face was full of ridicule and contempt. "Little girl, are you talking big? How are you going to make me unable to stay in Emerald City? I'm really looking forward to it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rising tone at the end was full of frivolity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper frowned and was about to speak, but Roger interrupted, "Her father is Jason, the chairman of Emerald City Reed Group, and her mother is Grace, a renowned lawyer in Emerald City. Do you think she doesn't have the ability to make you unable to stay in Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thugs were stunned and looked incredulous upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thug who had previously spoken with Jasper even gasped and turned pale, then left in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper turned to Roger and said, "If these people bother you again, just let me know. If they really try to sue you for excessive defense, I'll have my mom hire a lawyer for you. I guarantee they won't dare to have any bad intentions again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger looked at her steadily and suddenly asked, "Did you hug the police officer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated for a moment, then her expression became somewhat embarrassed. "Um...I didn't know you could easily take down those people. If I had known you were so capable, I wouldn't have called the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why did you help me just now? And why did you say those harsh words to those people?" He continued to ask, "Is it because of my face?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at the handsome face in front of her, even though he had just been in a fight, his face didn't seem to have suffered any injuries and still looked good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, who would believe that there was a brawl in the alley before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," she answered him like this, "I helped you not because of your face. Even if you don't look anything like Lawrence, I would still help you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes flickered slightly, "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because I don't want to see anyone being bullied. I don't want to turn a blind eye when I clearly see it happening and not help those people," Jasper said, feeling a bit uneasy as he met the other's gaze. "Although I know that saying these things might make me sound 'fake', and even if I want to help others, it's not just up to me, but also up to the Reed family. But...if I see it happening, I will still do something about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because she didn't want Lawrence's incident to happen again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If someone had reached out to help Lawrence when he had his accident, then maybe...everything would have been different!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger didn't say anything else, he just turned around and walked straight out of the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, wait a minute!" Jasper hurried to catch up with Roger and they left the police station together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as they left the police station, a taxi happened to pass by. Jasper quickly raised his hand to signal the taxi and then took Roger's hand to get in the taxi together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stanford University!" Jasper told the taxi driver the address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you get everything you needed?" Roger's voice sounded in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did Jasper realize that he had been holding his hand all along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry." She quickly let go, but there was a sticky feeling between their fingers now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper lowered his head in confusion and looked at his fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a touch of crimson on his fair skin...blood?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she wasn't injured! That meant...this was Roger's blood?</p></div>
