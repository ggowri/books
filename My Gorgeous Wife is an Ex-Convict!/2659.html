        <h1>Chapter 2657</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian chuckled. 'Is she kind? Or is she stupid?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But... people like her are rare.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll get you some hot water. It'll calm you down," he said and got up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me do it," she quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'd better sit down first. Your hand will probably shake and you&rsquo;ll spill hot water all over,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at her slightly trembling hands and did not insist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Brian walk into the kitchen, Valda Theller smiled wryly and leaned against the couch's armrest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought her nightmare in university was over for her, but it never occurred to her that... it had been in the back of her mind the whole time. She would easily recall the trauma she endured back then when she met similar situations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked blankly at her left hand. She was less frightened the moment she grabbed his hand. It was just like how he showed up and saved her when she was desperate today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that it felt good to have someone save you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The apartment was also not as cold as it used to be because of the presence of another person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As her fear gradually dissipated, the effects of the alcohol she drank before seemed to kick in slowly, making her close her eyes...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian came out of the kitchen with hot water, he found Valda Theller asleep on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He set the glass aside and looked at the figure. Her head was tilted, and her body was slightly curled up. Her pale face and slightly messy hair seemed to tell him what she had gone through today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was silent for a moment before bending down. He gently picked Valda Theller up and walked toward her bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After carefully laying her on the bed in the bedroom, Brian pulled the thin blanket to cover her. As he was about to turn to leave, stammering murmurs suddenly rang out. "No... I&rsquo;m scared... I'm scared... Mom and Dad... I... I'm scared... Save me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The soft murmurs seemed to carry heavy pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned his head to see that her eyes were still closed. It was clear that she was still asleep. However, her face was pale, she was frowning, and her head was shaking side to side from time to time. She seemed to be trying to shake off a nightmare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is she dreaming about? She's calling for her parents who died when she was very young.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was sobbing, looking like a poor little thing who was abandoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Abandoned?' Brian's eyes darkened slightly. He was abandoned too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He bent over, raised his hand, and gently pressed his palm on Valda Theller's forehead. His cold voice said indifferently, "You're okay now. You're safe now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to hear him in her dream. The uneasiness slowly faded from her face, and her sobs grew quieter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're okay now... You're okay..." His voice continued to ring as if to put her to sleep.</p></div>
