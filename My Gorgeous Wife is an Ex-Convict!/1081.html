        <h1>Chapter 1080</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Indeed, they can't take you away even if they found this place," he said as he pulled his phone out and handed it to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not her phone but his!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, she had a good memory. She remembered both Lina and Kyla's phone numbers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace called Lina first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina answered her phone, she was so shaken that she almost dropped her phone when she heard Grace's voice. "Grace, where... Where are you? Do you know how worried I was when Jason took you? Did Jason hurt you? How dare that son of a b*tch take you?! This is kidnapping. Kidnapping!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately felt awkward. The phone call was on speakerphone. In other words, Jason heard everything her best friend said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glanced at the phone with a half-smile. Grace was afraid that her best friend would say something that might annoy Jason, so she immediately said, "I'm&hellip; I'm fine, Lina. I just called to tell you not to worry about me. As for Kyla, I&rsquo;m supposed to help her with her case, but now I may not be around. If... If I haven't come to you in a week, can you please ask Hadwin Stephenson to help find a good lawyer for Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace said this, Lina immediately panicked. "What's going on? What the hell happened to you? Can't you come back even after a week? Is Jason prisoning you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina asked a series of questions that Grace did not know how to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she said, "We have something to take care of. You don't have to worry about me. If... you can, help Kyla out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Grace ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said lightly, "You're still thinking of helping Kyla Corbyn at such a time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her eyes and said, "It's all I can do." Even so, Kyla was probably going to lose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Kyla's criminal record was the most unfavorable factor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, she still wanted to put up a fight for Kyla. Grace then dialed Kyla Corbyn's phone and briefly told Kyla Corbyn that she had to deal with something, so she probably could not handle the case now. If she could not handle it, Lina and Hadwin Stephenson would help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, are you okay? Did something happen?" Kyla Corbyn asked hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's no big deal. Alright, Kyla, please say hello to Nelson for me. I'm afraid I can't video call him these days, but I'll make up for it later," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call ended, she looked at the phone and looked up at the person in front of her. "Jason, can't you let me leave for a while? Even if it&rsquo;s just during Kyla's case? Besides, it won't do you much good to keep me here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" he muttered as he pulled the phone out of her hand before saying, &ldquo;Do you know what this room is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Huh?' She was stunned, not understanding why he asked that all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's another name for this room. &lsquo;Splashes of Blood&rsquo;," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help frowning. Such a name had an ominous ring to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know why it has such a name?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head. 'How could I know that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a low chuckle, he pressed the switch on the display case in front of him and the glass cover over the sword slowly opened, exposing the ancient sword inside.</p></div>
