        <h1>Chapter 3555</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll go too," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper almost choked on his saliva. "But don't you usually dislike attending these kinds of lively gatherings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you're going, I also want to see what this mixer is like. Plus, it's allowed to bring friends, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's true, but..." She hesitated for a moment, looking at William's serious expression, before finally saying, "Alright then, I'll let my roommates know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a pause, she asked, "But William, do you want to go because you, like me, want to see what it's like, or do you want to find someone to date?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's eyes flickered slightly, "What if I want to find someone to date?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback. Although she had asked the question, when she heard him say that, she suddenly felt a tightness in her chest and an uncomfortable feeling surged up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to find a girlfriend?" she asked, stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her and after a moment, he slowly said, "Not at the moment. But if I do, that person must be someone I swear to protect for a lifetime. In this lifetime, I will only love that person!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, his gaze was like a kind of magic, making it impossible for her to look away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she felt a bit envious of his future girlfriend. "William, what does it feel like to only love one person for your whole life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's a feeling of not being able to lose them. If you lose that person, you feel like you've lost everything and there will be no more happiness," William said. He expressed his feelings for her that he had never spoken out loud before, using this opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if you never meet that person?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, he had already met her! He silently thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at his silence and suddenly seemed to realize something. She quickly said, "Oh, forget what I just said. You will definitely meet that person!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled, "Yes, you will definitely meet someone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But when I heard my dorm mates talking about what to do after getting a boyfriend, like watching movies together, eating together, holding hands, celebrating holidays...I realized that we have done many of these things together. So what is the difference between being in a relationship and not being in one?" Jasper murmured as if she suddenly realized something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to know the difference?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know?" Her eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William stood up. The two of them were sitting face to face at a round table, and Jasper thought he was going to leave, but instead he leaned forward, placed his hands on the table, leaned over the table, and suddenly brought his face close to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stared at the face that was so close to him. In her memory, she had often looked at his face up close like this when they were children, because they used to sleep together and she liked to hold onto him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as they grew older, they had never been this close to each other again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What...what are you doing?" She suddenly felt nervous, and even her voice became stuttered.</p></div>
