        <h1>Chapter 2481</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, they had no other solution unless they had the right liver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were things in this world that no amount of money and no amount of power could solve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the days that followed, the Mitchell family's grief-stricken performance in front of the reporters at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance and the online apology by Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s former attending doctor had gone viral online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the police had announced that they would be investigating the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were all sorts of speculation online. Of course, most people believe that the Mitchell family did admit their healthy eldest daughter to the mental hospital by force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Louise Mitchell and Mr. Mitchell were holding all of Amber Mitchell's shares on her behalf, while Louise Mitchell even married Amber Mitchell's former fianc&eacute;, George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was the biggest beneficiary after what had happened to Amber Mitchell no matter how one looked at it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many netizens were waiting for the story to unfold online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell came out of the police station with a nervous breakdown, only to face the camera flashes of reporters who had been waiting for her for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All kinds of tough questions were directed at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell could only keep her head down and quickly got into the car with her bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police had been questioning her all day. At this point, there was no way she could even pay her way out because it was too big a deal now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone was waiting to learn the truth of the incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Louise Mitchell got into the car, she received a phone call from her father, but what he told her made her heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The doctors who diagnosed Amber Mitchell with mental illness are now unreachable. Louise Mitchell, do you think someone has gotten to them, just like what had happened to the attending doctor? If their statements are consistent and they say we bribed them, our family..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was evident panic in Mr. Xia's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Mitchell family would not only become street rats but also bear criminal responsibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can they be unreachable? I met them the day before yesterday and they were still reachable!" Louise Mitchell fumed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if they're suddenly unreachable, I only asked them to go into hiding for a while. What do we do now? Why don't you... ask George to do something about this. He's the son-in-law of the Mitchell family, after all. There's no reason why he should just stand by and do nothing when the Mitchell family is in trouble," Mr. Mitchell said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell only thought her father was naive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, her father had been in the business world for a long time. He had met many people and encountered many situations over the years. How could he still be so naive? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Mitchell family was already in such a state. George would have helped them a long time ago if he wanted to and would not have dragged this on until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Gregory family had not done anything, which only indicated that they intended to look on and do nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Louise Mitchell became even more resentful.</p></div>
