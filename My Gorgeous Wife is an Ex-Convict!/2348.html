        <h1>Chapter 2346</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A low air pressure filled the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom, who was sitting in front, was terrified. 'Miss... Miss... Miss Corbyn is with another man! Chairman Weiss even caught them together!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips together tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He came here to see her one last time before she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was him saying goodbye to his past relationship or whatever. He just... wanted to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before making this decision, he kept telling himself he would banish her from his heart once and for all after seeing her one last time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not expect to see this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... was with Chase Harper. She was going back to Emerald City with Chase Harper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A wave of jealousy spread in Martin Weiss's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly stopped walking and swayed toward Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper hurriedly caught Kyla. "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just went limp suddenly. It sometimes happens ever since I got pregnant," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because of calcium deficiency? I heard the doctor say it's easy to suffer calcium deficiency during pregnancy. You'll sometimes go limp when you have calcium deficiency," said Chase Harper. After all, he previously paid a lot of attention to his ex-wife when she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it must be. It never happened before this. It only happened recently," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's find a place to rest first. Let's sit for a while. It's still early anyway," said Chase Harper. For fear that Kyla would go limp and fall, he continued to hold her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when the two turned around to head for the rest area, they saw a figure standing not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... What is he doing here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face was frigid as he went up to Kyla and Chase Harper. "I didn't expect you two to be here together. What's the matter? Are you planning to go back to Emerald City together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip slightly and said nothing. She somehow sensed an air of danger coming from Martin Weiss. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing the silence, Chase Harper smiled and said, "Yeah, Mr. Weiss. Kyla and I are going back to Emerald City together. We can look after each other during our journey this way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Look after each other?" Martin Weiss snorted coldly. "I wonder how you're going to look after her during your journey."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper froze. Even though he was a simple and honest man, he could still gauge that something was wrong from Martin Weiss's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla frowned and said, "Martin Weiss, what are you trying to do? Didn't you ask me to never appear before you again? Why did you appear here, then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, why did I appear here?" He burst into a self-deprecating laugh, and there was a tinge of anger in it. He was mad that he could not help coming to the train station even though he had forgotten their relationship through hypnosis!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was mad at himself for still being under the woman's influence. It was as if she still had control over his emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, are you and Chase Harper really just friends? He called you &lsquo;Kyla&rsquo; so intimately just now." Martin Weiss was overcome with anger. "But don't forget you're still my wife. If you're hooking up with him, it's adulter&mdash;"</p></div>
