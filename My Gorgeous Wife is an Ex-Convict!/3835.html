        <h1>Chapter 3833</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, in about a week, Mason will be discharged from the hospital. Veronica, do you want to stay at our house too?" Jasper suddenly suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face turned red, "Stay...stay at your house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, although Mason will be discharged from the hospital, his mobility will still be limited. Veronica, you have been taking care of Mason all this time, so why not stay at our house together to make it easier for you to continue taking care of him? Besides, you have stayed at our house before, and your room is still there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Reed family, there is a room for Veronica. When Mason used to live with the Barlow family, he would sometimes need to stay at the Reed family for a few days, and Veronica would often accompany him there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, the Reed family also prepared a room for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, although Mason had a falling out with Veronica and went abroad, Veronica's </span><span>room in the Reed family was still kept and no one had touched it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only now that Veronica learned that her room in the Reed family was still being kept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's suggestion was very much appreciated by Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at Veronica and asked, "Do you want to stay at my house and take care of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face turned even redder. She hadn't thought much about living with him before, but now it felt like they were cohabiting, even though...well, there were other people in the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But facing Mason's direct gaze, Veronica answered honestly, "Of course, if it won't be a bother to your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would it be a bother? My parents would be thrilled if you stayed with us," Jasper quickly interjected, adding, "And Mason would be happy too, right Mason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I would be happy," Mason replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt like her face was on fire and couldn't help but admire Mason's ability to answer so calmly without changing his expression!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike her, who couldn't hide her emotions at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending about an hour in the hospital room, Jasper and William left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiously, Veronica asked Mason, "How come my room was kept? Weren't you studying abroad at the time? Did you really want to keep my room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was being a bit subtle, but strictly speaking, she thought he would have wanted to erase everything related to her, which was why he chose to hypnotize his feelings away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did consider getting rid of your room. On the night before I left for my studies abroad, I stayed in your room all night and thought about whether to throw away everything inside!" Mason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why didn't you?" Veronica asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I couldn't bear to. I was afraid that if I threw everything away, I would never be able to find it again," Mason said. Even though he hated her at the time and wanted to erase his feelings for her, he was still conflicted about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So in the end, he hypnotized his feelings away but kept her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry," Veronica held Mason's face and said, "If only I had realized my true feelings earlier, we wouldn't have gone through such a big circle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really feel sorry, then love me even more," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," she agreed, kissing him on the lips, so sweetly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, she would love him constantly, giving him lots and lots of love, all the love she hadn't given him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, he was her little brother, but in the future, he would be the one who would accompany her for life!</span></p></div>
