        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it was precisely because of this that she liked him so much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper walked up quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William saw Jasper coming and raised the milk tea in his hand, "I bought this for you, it's still warm, do you want to open it and drink it now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his sentence, Jasper suddenly held his cheeks with both hands, pulled him down, and kissed him on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was surprised, there were still people around! Didn't she dislike being affectionate in public?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she took the initiative to kiss him like this, could it be...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as it ended, William immediately took Jasper's hand and walked towards a less crowded area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't stop until they reached a secluded place, then turned to Jasper and asked, "Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed her lips awkwardly. How could she say it? That Lawrence had kissed her?! It was hard to say!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-nothing," she hesitated and replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you say that you hoped we could be honest with each other and trust each other? If so, then what can't you tell me?" William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... don't be angry," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her and said after a moment, "Okay, I won't be angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I met Lawrence in the murder mystery game in our class just now, and he... kissed me," she said, her voice trembling slightly towards the end, and... with difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, being forcibly kissed was not a good memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's body suddenly stiffened, so that's why she ran over to kiss him when she saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be very sad," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that she must have been unwilling, especially since it was Lawrence, the person she had always felt indebted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A little bit," Jasper said with a slightly hoarse voice, "People can really change a lot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lawrence in her heart was once shy and innocent, but this Lawrence, who said he could secretly date and was two-timing, made her feel like she didn't know him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps only she was still living in memories, thinking that Lawrence was still the Lawrence of the past, unwilling to admit that the Lawrence in reality had changed too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, even if she didn't want to admit it, she had to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think about it anymore, forget about it. If you still can't forget, I'll help you. I'll help you no matter how many times," William said, slowly bending down and getting close to her face. His voice was gentle and low, "Do you want me to help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that his words had lifted the burden from her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her William was always so gentle to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, help me!" She wanted to use his kiss to cover up the bad memories. She only wanted to remember the feeling of his kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she wished, he kissed her lips gently and carefully, not missing any corner of her lips, as if he wanted to completely eliminate the scent left by Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper, her Jasper, would never let her get hurt no matter what!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p></div>
