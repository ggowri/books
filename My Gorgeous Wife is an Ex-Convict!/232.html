        <h1>Chapter 231</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he finished his sentence, his lips moved closer to hers, almost completely pressed against her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face could not help but turn red. "Don't..." she said, flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused as his eyes fixed on her. "Then Sis should tell me how you know him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was because someone stole his bracelet once. The thief knocked into me, and it fell into the pocket of my shirt. He wanted to take it back, and that's how I knew him,&rdquo; Grace said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" he muttered. "How many times have you two met since?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never counted the number of times she met Brian! However, looking at Jason's approaching face, Grace quickly counted them in her head and said, "Four... Four times. One was when he said he wanted to thank me for the bracelet by inviting me to a meal. Another occasion was at the county, and another chance encounter at the hospital my grandmother was hospitalized in. The most recent one is at the film set where I was an extra."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glistened. Knowing Brian, if Brian wanted to thank her for the bracelet, he would have used money instead of going the extra mile and taking her out to dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, did Brian have his heart set on her too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why Grace? Brian just started dating Evelyn not long ago. If it had been in the past, Brian would not be interested in another woman when he was already dating someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now... an exception seemed to have been made!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does Sis like him?" he asked, still referring to the earlier question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you I have nothing to do with him. What's more, he's the crown prince of the entertainment industry. I'm just a sanitation worker." They were two people who did not belong together. In her opinion, Jason&rsquo;s question was meaningless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't I have a crush on Sis too?" Jason chuckled and stuck his lips to the corners of her mouth, sucking in the sticky grains of rice on her lips into his mouth. "What if Brian is attracted to Sis too? Will you like him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened, and her blood seemed to boil over at his gesture. It left her with a blank mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, Sis?" He nibbled the grains of rice in his mouth. "Will you like him or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She put her hands on his chest, but could not push him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... I won't..." she said anxiously, hoping that he would put an end to his flirtatious ways.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You cannot lie to me," he murmured. His voice was like a double bass, sinking into her ears. "Never like Brian, all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body stiffened suddenly. His voice was beautiful, but beneath it was a chilling warning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she were to ever like Brian in the future, she would be doomed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Jason who had deceived her into thinking that he and she were in the same boat, but it turned out that she was being played like a fool by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he was asking her not to lie. How ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't like him now, but I don't know if I'll ever..." She opened her mouth for a final act of verbal defiance. Perhaps it was the only resistance she had left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could finish, he was pressing hard against her lips, blocking all her words.</p></div>
