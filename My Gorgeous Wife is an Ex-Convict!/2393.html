        <h1>Chapter 2391</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that Chairman Weiss and Mrs. Weiss are here for more than just business today." George Gregory looked cold as he said, "I don't want to talk about the past. My wife is Louise Mitchell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory, you're wrong. Even if your wife is Louise Mitchell, Amber Mitchell is your sister-in-law, isn't she?" Martin Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's eyes grew colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chairman Weiss, I'm sorry, but I can't play along if you're looking for trouble." With that said, he got up to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really think Amber Mitchell is mentally ill?" Kyla asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's expression changed slightly. "Could the doctor be wrong with his diagnosis? She's mentally ill!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't the doctor be wrong in his diagnosis? Or do you wish she's mentally ill?" Kyla demanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory stared at Kyla, a faint flicker of rage in his eyes. "What are you trying to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you really love Amber Mitchell? If so, why are you ignoring her when she&rsquo;s been in the mental hospital for so many years without even visiting her once? You&rsquo;re leaving her to be subjected to all kinds of abuse in there. She even lost her right ring finger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said as she observed George Gregory's expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flash of shock in his eyes. "What did you say? She lost... her right ring finger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Didn&rsquo;t you know? Even I, who just found her, know that she's missing a finger on her right hand, but you, her former fianc&eacute; and now brother-in-law, don't know that?" Kyla said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory pressed his thin lips together. He took a few moments to hide his shock before glaring coldly at Kyla. "It seems that you&rsquo;ve investigated everything before coming, but whatever happens to Amber Mitchell is the Mitchell family's business. It has nothing to do with you. So what if you were friends with her? She's only a lunatic now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt a pang in her heart. She wondered how Amber Mitchell would feel if the man she once loved called her a &lsquo;lunatic.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell loved the wrong person. It's a pity she never saw your true colors," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's expression changed abruptly, and he suddenly stretched out his hand to push Kyla. "Shut up. What do you know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before his hands touched Kyla, Martin Weiss stopped him. "Mr. Gregory, regardless of what my wife said, she's pregnant. It's inappropriate for you to do this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's scarlet eyes glared at Martin Weiss before he stared at Kyla. He seemed to regain some of his senses. "If you want your wife to be safe in Deer City, tell your wife to never say that in front of me again, Chairman Weiss! She doesn't know anything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, George Gregory left the meeting room without looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss turned to look at Kyla. "Do you know how dangerous that was? Those words of yours triggered him. What would you have done if he lost his temper, pushed you, and hit you?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But didn't you protect me?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It made Martin Weiss speechless. After a while, he said, "What if I hadn't stopped him?"</p></div>
