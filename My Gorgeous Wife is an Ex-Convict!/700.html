        <h1>Chapter 699</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his opinion, Stella Lindsay was only rumored online to be the crown prince's next girlfriend, but the prince never admitted it, had he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he was not afraid to offend Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, unexpectedly, the crown prince actually accompanied her here, which made him look like he was concerned about Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Stella Lindsay really the woman the crown prince likes?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One was the crown prince's woman, and the other one was Young Master Reed's woman. Manager Wang only wished he could pass out immediately so that he would not have to face such a difficult problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only stared at Grace blankly. She stood still, waiting for the manager's reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lights from the corridor fell softly on her, making her look gentle and quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there seemed to be tenacity in those apricot eyes. The woman may look gentle, but it seemed as if nothing could crush her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like her three years in prison. Even these three years of pain could not erase the tenacity and clarity in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay looked at the way Brian looked at Grace and felt even more jealous. Therefore, she bit her lip and pretended to be aggrieved as she said, "Brian, I wanted to wear the gown to show it to you. Didn't you say you liked the color purple when we were younger? You said you were going to give me a purple dress someday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pursed his thin lips slightly. When he heard Stella Lindsay say these words, his heart seemed to start throbbing again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person who attracted all his attention was not the one he was looking for. The one who was with him when he was younger was Stella Lindsay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why must it be Stella Lindsay? Why can't it be Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was no solution to this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just choose another one. This isn't the only purple dress," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing Brian's words, Manager Wang felt a little relieved. He felt like he was alive again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's eyes were full of resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace suddenly said, "Sis, since you like this gown, I'll give it to you." Then, she turned her head to Manager Wang and said, "Let's go back to where we were. I'll just choose another dress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay was stunned, not expecting Grace to give in to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this did not make her happy. Instead, she thought she was just picking up what Grace did not want.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the one who asked for the gown, so now, she could not say no.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you giving?" A graceful male voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up and saw Jason coming over. "Why are you here?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I took care of whatever was at hand and came over to see you," he said, a flash of amazement in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her water-like serenity complemented the composed and mysterious purple color. She seemed to be getting more and more beautiful before she knew it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was gentleness and vigor in her eyes that had replaced the lethargy during their first meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was getting more and more worried that his Grace would inadvertently attract other men, just like... Brian who was here right now!</p></div>
