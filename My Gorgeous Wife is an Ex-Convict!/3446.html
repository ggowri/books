        <h1>Chapter 3444</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the doctor finished speaking, he prescribed medication for Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel wanted to hug Veronica again and walk her back to her classroom, but Veronica declined, saying "No... it's okay, I can walk by myself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he really carried her back to the classroom, then tomorrow everyone in the classroom would probably be talking about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let me support you back to the classroom," said Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, Veronica did not refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked slowly towards the direction of the classroom, while Daniel carefully stroked it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daniel asked, 'Do you know the girl who pushed you?'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," Veronica said. "Maybe she's a girl who likes Mason." During this time, she knew that many girls had confessed their feelings to Mason and even gave him gifts, but he rejected them all and threw away the gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's possible that because of this, the girl directed all her resentment towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just now...thank you so much," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you saying? You are the person I like, so it's only natural for me to protect you. No need to say thank you," said Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica paused in her steps, lifted her head, and stared somewhat dazedly at the cheerful, big guy in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The way he protected her just now, even when the other person was insulting her, he didn't hesitate to fight back and defend her. If someone says they weren't moved by that, they're lying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um..." She hesitated for a moment and said, "Do you still want me to be your girlfriend? If I really become your girlfriend, you may still hear things like today, or even worse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!" He said without hesitation, "I like you and trust you, so no matter what hurtful things may come in the future, I only believe what you say."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze was fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she felt something stirring in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The word "trust" from his mouth sounded so wonderful in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, as if making a certain decision, Veronica said, "Okay, I...I agree!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Daniel was overjoyed and picked up Veronica, spinning her around. "Great, great!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, you..." She wanted to stop him, to make him stop, but his smile was infectious, making her laugh along with him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, not far away, this scene was all seen by a pair of beautiful black eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason stiffened as he watched Veronica's smiling face, feeling his heart sinking lower and lower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He heard someone say that Veronica had been pushed by another girl, and Daniel took her to the infirmary, so he hurried to the infirmary. However, he didn't expect to see such a scene on the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did Veronica agree to Daniel's request?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, we have reached this step!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he had mentally prepared himself beforehand, seeing this scene in front of him still made him feel so uncomfortable. It was so uncomfortable that his breathing became incredibly difficult, as if his whole body was immersed in ice water, and he was completely covered by despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this... the so-called growing up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, people who thought they would never be separated, slowly drifted apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I used to think that we were the most important people to each other, but it turns out that we have been replaced by someone else...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this is what growing up means, then he would rather never grow up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason took a deep look at Veronica and Daniel, then turned around and left quietly without attracting anyone's attention, just like when he arrived.</p></div>
