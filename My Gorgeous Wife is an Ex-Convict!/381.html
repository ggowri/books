        <h1>Chapter 380</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason picked up the plate of food, went up to her, and laid it in front of her. "Sis, if you want to know where your mother is buried, you'd better eat this now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up, her red and swollen almond-shaped eyes wearing an expression of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What did he mean by that? Did it mean... "Do you know where my mother is buried?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll tell you after you finish this," He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace heard this, she felt as if she suddenly had some motivation. She picked up the food on the tray and started to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned. She was now gobbling up the food like a beast and was unlike her usual self.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, it proved how important her mother's grave was to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason furrowed his brows and looked at the tears that had rolled down Grace's face. Her eyes seemed redder and more swollen than when he last talked to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, during the time he had been gone, she had cried again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Eat slowly. Even if your father buried your mother in the north or south pole, I'll take you there!" said Jason. "If you choke, you're only going to waste more time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered. Her hand that was holding the chopsticks paused for a moment before she began to eat again, this time, at a much slower pace than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason watched over her until she finished eating before taking some tissue and carefully wiping the corner of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I've finished eating. Tell me where my mother is buried," Grace looked at the man in front of her. She was full of anticipation and&hellip; worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace seemed so afraid that her hopes would be dashed by the fact that he was unable to help her find where her mother was buried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his hand and stroked her cheek. Consequently, his fingertips became wet with her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go and wash your face. Your mother wouldn't like it if she saw you like this," He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, don&rsquo;t you believe me that I'll take you to where your mother is buried?" Jason smirked a little. "I'm the only one you can trust now, and only I can take you there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s eyes rested on his face for a moment before she turned around and walked to the bathroom. Then, she turned on the faucet on the sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her red, swollen eyes in the mirror and saw visible tear stains on her face. Even her bangs were in a mess, and she looked really unpresentable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If her mother saw the state she was in, she would be upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would Jason really take her to the place where her mother was buried? Would he just help her without any demands?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt extremely perturbed. However, no matter how perturbed she was, she could only do whatever Jason wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, just as he said, he was the only person she could trust for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After washing her face with clean water, Grace walked out of the bathroom only to see Jason sitting on the sofa, playing with his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did your father say he wants 50 million dollars for him to tell you where your mother is buried?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace answered with her head lowered.</p></div>
