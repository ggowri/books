        <h1>Chapter 3094</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really need to thank Lisa who saved you," Grace exclaimed, "If you tell me her address, Jason and I can go meet her and express our gratitude."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need, after I settle down here, I plan to bring Lisa over to live with me. I have already accepted her as my godmother," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's great, then I can finally meet your lifesaver," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was listening quietly on the side, but he was unusually silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After chatting for a while, Grace didn't want to leave yet, but Jason said, "You've been talking for a long time, and Valda is tired. Since Valda has already returned, there's always tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yes, there's still plenty of time ahead. Valda, you rest well. I'll come see you another day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving Valda's apartment, Grace turned to Jason and said, "Jason, don't you think there's something strange going on between Valda and Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean by 'strange'?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's like...there's something between them, like a barrier," Grace described, feeling that this wasn't quite the reunion she had imagined for Valda and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it does seem like there's a layer in between," said Jason. "It's probably because Valda has a lame leg."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace fell silent, suddenly understanding Valda's state of mind. After all... she had once felt the same way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian won't care if Valda has a limp," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were someone else, she might not dare to make such a guarantee, but with Brian's words... If you had seen how crazy Brian was because of Valda, then you would understand that this man, as long as Valda is still alive, no matter what Valda becomes, he will want her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you know it, I know it, but... does Valda know? And even if she does, will she still stand by Brian's side?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What does that mean?" Grace asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian is not an ordinary person after all. The Hart family's business is mostly in the entertainment industry, so his every move will be noticed by the media. In other words, his life is mostly under the spotlight. If Valda wants to accompany Brian, she is destined to stand under the spotlight with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason didn't say anything else, but Grace had already realized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that Valda has a limp and needs to stand under the spotlight with Brian, it takes extraordinary courage. Will Valda be able to withstand all the rumors and gossip that may arise?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I want to help Valda!" Grace said firmly, determined to prevent Valda from being hurt again, no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I understand, but some tasks can be helped with, while others cannot," said Jason. "As for the future, it ultimately depends on Valda's own willingness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, one thing is certain - in the future, the Reed family will always stand behind Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing off Jason and Grace, Valda closed the door and felt a pair of arms wrap around her from behind. Instantly, she was enveloped in a broad embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That is... Brian!</p></div>
