        <h1>Chapter 4390: Falling for Someone</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because of his well-crafted role in that drama, especially his tear-jerking scenes, that many people online hailed him as the man with the most beautiful tears. As a result, his resources took a step up, and his popularity became increasingly explosive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, call him Uncle Elledge," Harley said to Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Elledge," Quinn called out obediently, "Can Uncle Elledge take off his mask? I want to get a good look at Uncle Elledge."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert Elledge hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he took off his mask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Calvert's face was flushed with embarrassment, which </span><span>actually made</span><span> his face even more attractive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Elledge, why are you always so upset? If someone doesn't like you, then you can just like someone else. Like me, you can like me." The innocent words of a child left Calvert somewhat amused and bemused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley curled his finger, lightly tapping on Quinn's little head, "I've told you before, it's just a TV show, not real, just a performance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the little one is still young and often easily believes that the performances in cartoons and TV shows are real.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's kind of strange, while other kids prefer watching cartoons, this little one </span><span>actually enjoys</span><span> watching TV shows, and always watches them with great interest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the adults asked her if she could really understand, her little head nodded rapidly. She proudly said, "I can understand it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I like you too, but not in that way," Calvert stammered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of liking is it then, if not that kind?" the little one asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I mean is... because you're a child, my affection for you is the kind one has for a child, not the kind... where one wants to make the other their wife," Calvert carefully explained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, a wife... that's the same as a spouse, right?" The little one started sorting through her vocabulary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, that's... that's what I mean," Calvert responded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley couldn't help but chuckle. What kind of adult would seriously engage in a question-and-answer session with a 3 or 4-year-old kid like this?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This innocent look of his, it's </span><span>really hard</span><span> to reconcile it with the stern image he usually presents in public.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm... My daddy really loves his wife, who is my mommy. So, who is Uncle Elledge's wife that he loves?" Quinn asked curiously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's no one else, can I be Uncle Elledge's wife? That way, Uncle Elledge would like me that way, right?" The little one asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I... I already have someone I like!" blurted out Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is it?" Quinn asked, his eyes wide.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, who is it?" At the same time, Harley was also curiously looking at Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such intense stares from both the young and the old, Calvert's face turned even redder. It was as if he was at a loss, his deep black eyes misty, almost as if he was on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, Uncle Elledge, are you about to cry?" Quinn exclaimed in surprise, "Please don't cry. Is it because the person you like doesn't like you back? But I'm still a child, I can't be your wife yet. Mommy said I </span><span>have to</span><span> grow up first before I can be someone's wife. How about letting Aunt Harley be your wife first? When I grow up, I can be your wife then."</span></p></div>
