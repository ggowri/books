        <h1>Chapter 1529</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, only a few people knew about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed almost lost his mind when you fell into the ocean. Later, Secretary Wang brought a baby and an urn of ashes to Young master Reed. Young master Reed was overwhelmed with sorrow as he held your ashes in his arms. If we didn&rsquo;t make Young master Reed forget about you at that time, he wouldn't be able to live at all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What Terrence said set off waves in Grace's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What kind of memories have I lost? Lost his mind... Jay almost lost his mind back then? Even to the point where he couldn&rsquo;t live?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What on earth happened? How did I fall into the ocean?" Grace asked quickly. She desperately wanted to know what memories she had not yet recalled!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence told Grace what had happened when she fell into the ocean. Then, he said, "Young master Reed was dejected as he held your ashes. Finally, Secretary Wang said we could only erase Young master Reed's memories of you. It was the only way for Young master Reed to survive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Erase? How? You only erased his memories of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"With hypnosis. Secretary Wang found a hypnotism expert at that time and finally succeeded in erasing his memories of you. But every once in a while, some fragments of your past will recur to Young master Reed. It's just that maybe his feelings for you may..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this point, Terrence looked at Grace somewhat sheepishly. After all, Young master Reed had loved Grace to death back then, but he had lost his memories of her now. He probably no longer had feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Of course... It was just a theory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Young master Reed cried when he met Grace today. He even took Grace to the car... It led Terrence to think that even though Young master Reed had been hypnotized and his memories were erased, he still treated Grace differently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace gasped and finally understood why Jason had behaved this way today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jay... has forgotten everything about our love.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was alright as long as he was alive. It did not matter even if he had forgotten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If I fell into the ocean back then, why does Jay think I left him?" Grace asked her doubts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well..." Terrence instantly seemed even more embarrassed. "Secretary Wang said that since Young master Reed has been hypnotized, it's better not to trigger him. If we told Young master Reed about you falling into the ocean, perhaps he would get triggered. He might lose his mind right away if he got too agitated. Therefore, we told Young master Reed that you found out about the truth of the case and... you left him right after giving birth. But you died in an accident when you left."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'So that's why!' Grace pressed her lips together. No wonder Jay was acting like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It seemed that she had a lot to work on, but even if he had forgotten and misunderstood her, she would try to make him fall in love with her again as long as he did not have another love interest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"By the way, is there any woman Jay likes now?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No. There's absolutely none!" Terrence said immediately. In the past five years, though Young master Reed had forgotten about Grace and did not intend to &lsquo;remain chaste&rsquo; for Grace, his lifestyle was more monastic than a monk's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What about Irene Lynch? There are many rumors online that he adopted Oriel Lynch because of Irene Lynch," asked Grace.</p></div>
