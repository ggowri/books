        <h1>Chapter 3864</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's still applying to withdraw from school," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to the school," Jasper said, standing up and walking quickly towards the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William quickly got up and followed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they got to the garage, William stopped Jasper and asked, "Are you going to find Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Jasper replied. "Since he's leaving, I want to see him again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she hasn't been going to school these days, subconsciously it's probably to avoid him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because if she sees him, she doesn't even know how to face him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person she owed in the past almost killed her loved ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His ruthlessness and changes exceeded her imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even these days, she often dreams of the shy little boy who used to sit in front of the piano and play beautiful music over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll accompany you," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper bit his lip. "I'm sorry, but this time, I want to see him alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No way!" William immediately vetoed. "What if he does something dangerous to you like last time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will choose a place with more people and surveillance, and I will also have the driver follow not far away," Jasper said. "You also know that he doesn't like you very much. I'm afraid that if you come with me, it will only cause conflict."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William didn't say anything, but his body blocked Jasper's way, obviously still worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper then said, "Since he has already planned to leave Emerald City, he won't hurt me. If he hurts me, he won't be able to leave Emerald City either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But even if there is a one in a million chance of danger, I don't want to take the risk," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper hesitated and said, "William, you know that Lawrence has always been a knot in my heart. I want to compensate him, but I also want to bring him to justice. But now, I haven't done either, and he's about to leave Emerald City. So I want to see him and say some things that I haven't said to him yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William looked at Jasper in front of him. They had known each other for so long, and he understood her very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that if she didn't see Lawrence today, this knot in Lawrence's heart would only sink deeper in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if he's not by her side...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a long pause, he finally said, "Then let's do what you said earlier. Have surveillance in crowded places, have the driver follow closely, and once it's over, come back. I'll be waiting here for you. Don't worry me too much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper smiled, "Okay, I promise. Don't worry, nothing will happen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A woman's intuition made Jasper understand that Lawrence wouldn't really hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was because of his complicated feelings for her that he couldn't vent his resentment directly on her, so he turned to her relatives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver drove Jasper to Stanford University.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William stood at the Reed family's gate until the car disappeared from view, then took out his phone and dialed a number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper went to school. Keep an eye on her safety. You should know what will happen if something happens to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person on the other end of the phone was a member of the Barlow family's security team, specifically left to protect William's safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, William wanted these people to protect Jasper with all their might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car arrived at the school, and Jasper got out and hurried towards the place to apply for withdrawal.</p></div>
