        <h1>Chapter 2746</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the crown prince of the entertainment industry would love a woman so much that he could go so far for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you? You can ask for anything if you're willing to do it. I&rsquo;ll do anything for you as long as it's within my power!" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The simple sentence contained so much emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Other women would be elated to hear Brian make such a promise, but Valda Theller's face contained no joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only squeezed her chopsticks harder, took a deep breath, and said, "I'm sorry, but I can't say yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some reason, disappointment flashed across Brian's heart after hearing the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can tell me if you have any special requirements. I can&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not what you think." Valda Theller interrupted him and raised her head. Her round eyes looked straight at the person in front of her. "I was willing to pretend to date you at the beginning because of sympathy. I thought you needed help. I wanted to help you just like how Camille helped me when I was in trouble. Since you helped me afterward, I wanted to repay you. That&rsquo;s why I was willing to pretend to be your girlfriend until the day you thought it was okay to stop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she said, "But a real relationship is unlike a fake one. It requires real feelings. It requires me to love you and you to love me. But that's impossible. I can't do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you mean you can't fall for me?" His dark phoenix eyes gazed at her. The melancholy and pain in his eyes made Valda Theller's heart skip a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Falling in love with Brian had never been difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were so many things a woman could love about a man like him. If he really wanted a girlfriend, he just had to say it and many women would go after him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Valda Theller, it's not too difficult to fall in love with me, is it? What's your ideal type? I can adapt myself to fit your ideal type."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My ideal type?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller laughed. 'He is my ideal type.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Cold and elegant, yet loyal and affectionate. He could shelter her from any trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather, she had fallen in love with him during their time together. She just repeatedly told herself that they were too different and that it would never work out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, like a spell, his words make her heartbeat quicken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if I can fall for you, you can't fall for me, can you? In that case, how can it be a real relationship?" she asked as she looked straight at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He froze slightly. His long black lashes quivered. "Do you want me to fall for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Any woman would want the man she loves to fall for her, and I'm no exception. I want my feelings to be reciprocated. If I want to love someone and be in a real relationship with someone, it&rsquo;ll be on the premise of marriage because I'm hoping I can spend the rest of my life with that person!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke seriously. The look on her face and the light in her eyes showed her seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"On the premise of marriage?" He suddenly smiled. Since he lost Grace, he never considered marriage. He even thought that perhaps that was it for the rest of his life. He would not marry any woman or let any woman enter his world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it did not annoy him when Valda Theller talked about having marriage as a precondition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I can date you on the premise of marriage," he said as his phoenix eyes seemed to have some resolution. "Fall for me, and... make me fall for you. Perhaps it would be the best for us."</p></div>
