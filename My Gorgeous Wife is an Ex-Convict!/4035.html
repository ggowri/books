        <h1>Chapter 4033</h1>
        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, the biggest challenge is after the child is born!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because her body is just dragging along now, this body is actually full of holes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The night before the C-section, Nancy tossed and turned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the Reed family found the best doctors, medical team, and equipment for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The success rate of the surgery is very high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even if the success rate is high, there is still a possibility of failure. If it fails, then she...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Can't sleep?" A low voice sounded in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A figure had already walked to her bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at Mick. During this time, he had been guarding her bedside, and even dealt with some work matters in her ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm, I can't sleep a little." Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you worried about tomorrow's surgery?" Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The surgery after tomorrow's delivery is a struggle for Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not just the surgery, but also the baby." Nancy said, "I don't know how the child will develop after being born tomorrow, whether they can breathe on their own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The medical team has already been fully equipped, and various problems have been anticipated. Nothing will happen." Mick said, "Don't think too much. Your most important task now is to rest well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy also knew that Mick was right. She needed to rest well and be in good spirits to face tomorrow, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick, if my surgery doesn't go smoothly tomorrow, if something unexpected happens to me, then you must live well and take care of our baby, like this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could finish her words, he stopped her by placing his finger on her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There won't be any unexpected situations," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's always a chance of something happening, I'm just saying in case..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There won't be any such cases," he interrupted her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That possibility was too heavy for him to bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy hesitated and bit her lip. "I'm just afraid..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter what happens, the child will live well, grow up, and the Reed family will give this child enough care and love. You don't need to worry about anything," Mick sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's eyelashes trembled. She reached out and hugged Mick, burying her face in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said "the Reed family" instead of himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, if her surgery really did have an accident, he would still be with her until death, as he had said before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if their child was born, he would not cling to this world for the sake of the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why bother..." Nancy couldn't say anything more because she didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My choice won't change, Nancy. I didn't persuade you before, so don't try to persuade me now, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy took a deep breath and listened to his strong heartbeat in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can definitely make it through, I will!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't guarantee anything else, but at least she could guarantee that her will to survive was stronger than anyone else's!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p></div>
