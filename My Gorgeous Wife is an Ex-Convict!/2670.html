        <h1>Chapter 2668</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at him coldly. "I don't need any explanation from you, Raymond Bowman. If you feel guilty for me, I hope you won't appear in front of me again. It's the best way for you to make things up for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paled. "Do you hate me that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied in amusement, "Do you think I should be glad to have you around from time to time? How would I have gone through that if you hadn't used me as a pawn and a stepping stone to get a woman? I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone viral for that either.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know I hurt you badly, but I just want you to give me another chance to make it up to you, Valda," Raymond Bowman said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make it up to me? That's unnecessary!" Valda Theller refused without mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's necessary because I..." He paused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller did not bother to talk to Raymond Bowman anymore. She got up to leave the room. She could discuss the script with the scriptwriter when they got back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Raymond Bowman lunged over and blocked her way. "Wait, can I finish what I have to say? Valda!" His voice was almost pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, I've said whatever I have to say to you. I think there's no need to talk about this anymore," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I tell you I'm not only feeling guilty for you but also..." His voice was bitter. After a long pause, he continued saying, "But also because I love you? Mingyu said I might have fallen in love with you long ago. I just didn't know it. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve been regretting what I did to you. I long for you so much that I can&rsquo;t get you out of my mind..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke with difficulty. 'Does she know how much courage it took for me to say this to her?&rsquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was shocked, never expecting Raymond Bowman to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I think maybe I love you. I've unconsciously fallen in love with you, so give me another chance. I won't hurt you this time. I&rsquo;ll try harder than anyone else to protect you," Raymond Bowman said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly laughed. She laughed so hard that she teared up. She found it ironic and ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, I would&rsquo;ve been touched if you had said this to me when I was bullied. I would&rsquo;ve forgiven you and gotten together with you, but now... Don't you think it's a little too late? Did you think I&rsquo;d always wait for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her hand and wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes. "You just think you might be in love with me, so you keep saying you're sorry and want to make it up to me and protect me. But what if you're not in love with me? Would you not have felt guilty at all? Do I deserve to be a pawn or a stepping stone? How can you make up for what I've suffered?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's questions made Raymond Bowman speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to say no and refute her, but he could not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like what she said, he felt guilty and wanted to make up for what he had previously don because he had fallen in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what if he was not in love with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All this might be nothing more than a trivial incident that happened back in his school days. It was in the past, and he would not have wanted to make it up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, I won't love you. Stop telling me such ridiculous things again," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because you're in love with your boyfriend?" His thin voice said with an unmistakable hint of jealousy.</p></div>
