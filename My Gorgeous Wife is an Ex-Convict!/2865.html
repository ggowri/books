        <h1>Chapter 2863</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However Valda Theller's self-mockery became more obvious. "Are you so sure? Nothing in this world is for sure. It is never a 'matter-of-fact' that he should help me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have to call him and let him know,&rdquo; said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Valda Theller's eyes fell on a related video link below the video. However, the video was not about the comic fiesta but Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller clicked on the video to see a car stop in front of a hospital. It was... Brian's car. She recognized it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A figure hurriedly got out of the car and hurried into the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The time the video was filmed was also stated. It was not long after the comic fiesta incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked blankly at the video. 'What is Brian doing at the hospital?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland, who was at her side, also watched the video with Valda Theller and said in confusion, "Isn't this Brian? What was he doing at a maternity hospital? And why was he in such a hurry? Did someone in his family give birth?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Give birth?' Valda Theller was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could think of that could make Brian so anxious and that involved giving birth... was Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be? Could Grace be having a baby today, so he rushed there? Even though he saw me getting insulted and mobbed, he was more worried about... Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's hand shook slightly as she held her phone, and it took her a few moments to dial Kyla's phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, it's me. I... I want to ask if Grace is in a maternity hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A surprised voice came from the other end of the line. "How did you know? I was visiting Grace today and witnessed the moment, so I accompanied her to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." She wanted to ask if Brian was also in the hospital with Kyla. However, she did not say those words even though they were at the tip of her tongue. "How&rsquo;s Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's still in surgery. The doctor is performing a C-section, and we're still waiting for the details," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wish Grace and the baby all the best," said Valda Theller. She really hoped so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Valda Theller said to Camille Strickland, "Camille, I'm going out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're going out now?" Camille Strickland was shocked. "Why are you going out now? You'd better have a good rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you ask me to look for Brian? I'm going to look for him now," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll go with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I'll go alone. Don't worry, I&rsquo;ll be fine. I survived university, so this is nothing." Valda Theller tried hard to force a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland looked at her best friend's smile but found her nose feeling sore. "What do you mean it's nothing? Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I want to see Brian alone. You'll be the third wheel if you go with me," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, but call me if anything happens," reminded Camille Strickland.</p></div>
