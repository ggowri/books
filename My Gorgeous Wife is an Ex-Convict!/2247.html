        <h1>Chapter 2245</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm taking the risk because the child is a little human life. Since they've chosen me as their mother, I'll fight for this child. On the other hand, you're taking such a big risk to get your blood drawn, but the chances that I&rsquo;ll need it is so slim that you don't need to do it at all!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "So, you don't think it's necessary? But... I want to take every safety precaution possible. Even if there's very little chance of something happening, that doesn't mean it's impossible, right? Either way, I'm going to keep getting my blood drawn and storing it until you deliver the baby. If you don&rsquo;t need the blood, that&rsquo;s all the better. It can then go to others who may need it. It won&rsquo;t go to waste. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not know how to persuade Martin Weiss anymore. Once a man like him made up his mind, it was hard to change it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the meal, Martin Weiss accompanied Kyla back to the hospital to collect her test results.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything was well, so there was nothing to worry about for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two walked out of the hospital, Kyla looked at Martin Weiss. "Is the driver taking you home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm driving home myself," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're driving yourself home in this state?" She froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just donated a little blood. It's not like I can't move. I'm fine, aren't I?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help frowning. The man looked pale but was saying he was fine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to have to take a taxi home anyway, so I might as well send you home first. You've just gotten your blood drawn. You'll easily get into an accident if you drive yourself," she said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her, and his thin lips said, "Don't be too nice to me. If you're too nice to me, you'll give me ideas I shouldn't have." It would only cause her trouble when that happened. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Kyla looked blankly at the person before her. Her mind went blank, and her heart beat wildly for no reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing," he muttered as he looked down gently. "I'll just take a taxi home, then. Don't worry. I won't drive today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he raised his hand and hailed a taxi. Then, he opened the door and said to her, "Why don't you get in first? I'll get myself another taxi later." He told the taxi driver the address of the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated a little before getting into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss closed the car door and watched the car leave. He smiled sadly when the taxi disappeared from his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew she probably just did not want to owe him anything or get involved with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had no idea how much restraint it took for him not to take her into his arms when she said things that sounded like she cared about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, don't be too nice to me if you're never going to fall in love with me again..." he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was scared he would get carried away if she was occasionally nice to him. He would also be reluctant to let her go. He might disregard everything and claim her for himself...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to make any more mistakes in front of her. He just wanted her to be alright. That would be enough!</p></div>
