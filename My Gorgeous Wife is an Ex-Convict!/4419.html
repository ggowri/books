        <h1>Chapter 4417: My Calvert</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At one banquet, he once again overheard others discussing him unintentionally.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really don't get why Harley fell for a minor model! Even dating them, so what if they've acted in a few movies and TV shows?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that he was originally one of those bottom-rung types, you know, the kind who would seize any small chance and desperately climb their way up. He finally snagged a big fish like Harley, must have used every trick in the book to do it," someone added.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just think about it, Harley's ex-fianc&eacute; was Lornell, from the Crypt families. Now, that's a family that truly matches the stature of the Hart family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe Harley is just fooling around. I mean, think about it, a prestigious family like the Hart family, there's no way they'd let their daughter marry a minor model!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe the little model will become a movie star someday?" someone said, but the tone was clearly mocking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha ha, the Movie King..." The others burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those born into powerful and prestigious families, even if an ordinary person struggles and becomes a movie star, it's nothing special to them; they hardly see it as an achievement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's hand hanging by his side unconsciously clenched tight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was standing in the corner, so those people chatting didn't notice him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of conversation was no big deal for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he's heard worse things before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, just pretend you didn't hear anything and quietly walk away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said to himself in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a voice suddenly rang out behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert, so you were here. I've been looking for you for ages," Harley's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people who were originally talking about him suddenly looked over this way, some of them with a flash of embarrassment on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert lowered his head and murmured softly, "Is that so? Let's go now then."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staying here would only make things more awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Harley grabbed his hand and then turned to the people who were gossiping earlier. "Who said that my relationship with Calvert was just for fun? We are in this with marriage in mind, so you better stop spreading these crazy rumors. Next time I hear something like that, I won't let it slide."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces changed, and they sheepishly said, "Alright, alright, we got it. It was a misunderstanding on our part."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Harley's status is extraordinary. Even though these people come from wealthy families with excellent backgrounds, they still fall short compared to Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, don't you think you owe my Calvert an apology?" Harley was already using the term "my Calvert."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone exchanged glances. Apologize to a junior model? Could that be possible?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But under Harley's gaze, what seemed impossible normally, suddenly seemed possible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert blankly accepted the apologies from those people, and even after they left, he still couldn't quite snap out of it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go." Harley took his hand and they headed out to the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I know you said that just now because you didn't want them to look down on me. Don't worry, I won't misunderstand," Calvert suddenly said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback, "What do you mean?" He hoped he hadn't misunderstood what she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just..." he said, biting his lip slightly, "you mentioned dating with marriage in mind, and I... I won't get the wrong idea, so you don't have to worry."</span></p></div>
