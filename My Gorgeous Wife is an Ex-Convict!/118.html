        <h1>Chapter 117</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She opened her bag and saw that all of her belongings were still inside.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her mobile phone had been discovered at the Miller residence and had been taken away from her. The phone had been turned off so Grace restarted it. She saw that her notifications were made up of a series of missed calls and text messages.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Some were from her grandmother, a few were from Lina, and there were a couple of strange calls as well.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can more or less guess the reason for Grandma calling me, but Lina..." She looked at her notifications and realized that Lina had called her nearly twenty times.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace quickly returned her call.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina hurriedly answered it. "Grace, is that you?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, my phone was... turned off yesterday. I only turned it on today and just saw your missed calls," Grace explained.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina let out a long sigh. "My goodness! I called you last night but it didn't go through. You said that you were going to your grandmother's house and I was worried that something had happened to you. Other than your grandmother, the relatives from her side of the family are all the kind of people who hit others when they're down."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina prattled on. She had called Grace from the previous night all the way through to the next morning but had not gotten through at all. The more she had thought about it, the more anxious she had felt so she had decided that if she still could not reach her friend by noon, she would go straight to her grandmother's house in the afternoon since she knew the address.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"By the way, they didn't do anything bad last night, did they?" Lina asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"They wanted to sell me off to a fool to be his wife and use the money to buy a house." Grace did not try to conceal the truth and relayed to Lina the incident that had happened the night before at her grandmother's house.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina listened with gritted teeth. "Why are there such shameless people? You weren't taken advantage of, were you?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm fine. Jay saved me, nothing happened to me," Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you currently back at the rental apartment? I'll come and find you," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't. I'm... I'm not back yet. I'm with Jay now. I'll meet you again when I'm back," Grace hurriedly replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina advised Grace to be careful and indignantly said, "Your family members should be punished. If you let them off too easily this time, they might sell you out again."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah, I know," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After hanging up, she hesitantly stared at the missed call from her grandmother. "What should I tell Grandma? Should I pretend that the incident never happened or should I say... that my uncles and aunt are being punished as they deserve?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She took a deep breath and dialled her grandmother's number. Not long after, the call was picked up and she could hear her grandmother's slightly trembling voice. "Grace, is that you?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes." Grace could not help but feel her nose tingling upon hearing her grandmother's voice.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, did...did something happen to you yesterday? I... I heard that you were later saved by an important person. Did Miller the fool take advantage of you? Did they..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, Grandma, I'm fine. Nothing happened last night," Grace explained.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's good, that's good." Her grandmother's tone showed her relief. "If something had happened to you, how would I face your mother when I go to heaven!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace could feel a tingling sensation in her nose again.</p></div>
