        <h1>Chapter 2573</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, do you know how bad the pain of losing a finger is? Do you know the horror of seeing your finger get cut off before your eyes? Do you have any idea how much I hated the person who cut my finger off at that moment? But my fianc&eacute; married the person who did it! She cut my finger off just because the ring I was wearing was an eyesore to her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said. Every word carried the pain she had suffered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"After you married Louise Mitchell, Louise Mitchell came to me wearing your wedding ring. Do you know how much it hurt me when she raised her right hand to show off the wedding ring you gave her? What makes you think you can make it up to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory&rsquo;s face turned utterly pale as his body swayed. Her mutilated right hand stung his eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never experienced the suffering and pain she spoke of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How painful was it to have a finger cut off?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he married Louise Mitchell after Amber Mitchell lost her finger, which was tantamount to another cruel blow to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. How am I going to make it up to you? I really can't make it up to you, can I?" George Gregory muttered as he suddenly raised his right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked surprised. Then, she saw George Gregory raise his left hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was confused, George Gregory suddenly grabbed his right thumb with his left hand. Then, she heard a crack...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was shocked. George Gregory was... breaking off his right thumb!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what surprised her more was that George Gregory continued to do it. From his thumb to the index finger and then the middle finger... The ring finger...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finger by finger, the sound of bones cracking kept ringing in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"S-George Gregory, what are you doing?" Amber Mitchell asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... can't make up for your pain, but at least I can feel it. You can cut off any of these fingers. You can even cut off all of them if you want!" A thin layer of sweat broke out on his forehead as his face grew paler. Even his lips turned ghastly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're out of your mind!" She could think of no other words to describe what he was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Out of my mind... Yeah, I'm out of my mind..." he murmured as he smiled blankly. Perhaps he had gone mad the moment he knew the whole truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was driven mad by regret and pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Crack!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was another crack, and he broke off the pinky on his right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Beads of sweat trickled down his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... sorry..." he gasped as he uttered the words. His body tottered, seemingly unable to stand still.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was silent. His madness was beyond her imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long while, she slowly said, "Leave. I don't need you to make it up to me, and I don't want to see you either. No matter how many times you apologize, it doesn't mean anything to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed utterly dejected as he bent over slightly. His deep black eyes dimmed as if they had lost all their luster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it doesn't mean anything... It doesn't mean anything..." he murmured.</p></div>
