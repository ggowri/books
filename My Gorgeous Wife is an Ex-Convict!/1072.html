        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they were stopped by the staff when they arrived. It did not work even after Lina stated her intention and revealed Hadwin Stephenson's identity. They only said that Brian was not at the company and they would not tell them his current location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked anxious, and Hadwin Stephenson comforted her by saying, "Don't worry. I'll make a phone call."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have Brian's contact information?" Lina was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, but it wouldn't be hard to get," said Hadwin Stephenson as he called someone on the phone. Sure enough, it was not long before they got Brian's contact information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was impressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was indeed the Stephenson family's patriarch. Others would have a lot of trouble getting the crown prince's personal contact information, but he could get it so quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson then dialed Brian's phone number. When the call went through, Lina said quickly, "Is... Is this... Brian... Young Master Hart? I'm Grace's best friend, Lina. I just want to ask, do you know where Jason has taken Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression changed slightly when he heard the name &lsquo;Lina&rsquo;. 'Is this the woman I met at the charity gala who&rsquo;s very close to Grace? She's also the one who worked hard to help Grace when she was in prison.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of hanging up the phone, Brian answered, "I haven't found out her whereabouts yet, but I'll keep looking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see. Neither have I, so if you have any information, please let me know," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," answered Brian before ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were rows and rows of electronic screens in front of Brian. They were showing the road surveillance that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, all the surveillance footage on the roads that Jason might have taken that night had been deliberately erased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't the surveillance footage be restored?" Brian asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The people who did this are experts, so I'm afraid it's going to be difficult," replied the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about the footage out of town? You can't find that either?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think he left town. We've checked the surveillance footage at the nearby cities' borders. Everything's normal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned. "Then keep on checking the roads where the surveillance footage has been erased and check whether there are any of the Reed family's properties there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be too easy to detect their whereabouts if Jason took Grace to a hotel. In that case, Jason would not have done it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," answered his men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Brian's phone rang again. He looked at the caller ID and realized it was his mother calling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed the answer button and said to the other end of the line, "Mom, what's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come back in the evening tomorrow and let&rsquo;s have dinner together," said Madam Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it," replied Brian as he stared again at the gray screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No matter where Jason has taken Grace, I&rsquo;ll find her!'</p></div>
