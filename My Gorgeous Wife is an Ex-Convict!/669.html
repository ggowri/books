        <h1>Chapter 668</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing. If it's what you want, of course, I'll do it for you," Brian said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's very kind of you, Bryn," said Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo; made Brian feel a pang in his heart. When she uttered the word, he somehow found it irritating to his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Call me Brian from now on. Bryn is just a childhood nickname," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Stella Lindsay replied obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, it was Grace who told her about the name Bryn. When Grace was a child, she came home with her dress in tatters and said that she had saved someone. No one in the family believed her and they all thought she was lying to cover the fact that she was being naughty. As such, they beat her for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Stella Lindsay was curious as a child and went to ask Grace about it. Hence, she knew how Grace had saved the little boy called Bryn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, when Brian found her, she would not have succeeded in pretending to be Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, what was more important was that Grace later developed a high fever that could not be treated at the hospital in town. She was transferred to the major hospital in Emerald City for treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After curing her illness, Grace completely forgot the memories of that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one cared at the time. She only lost a day's memory, which was a trivial matter to the adults. Plus, Grace did not even know she had lost a day's worth of memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Stella Lindsay did not know that Grace had forgotten that day until she overheard the adults mentioning it when she was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, in the end, apart from the little boy, Stella Lindsay was the third person who knew what happened that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was the chance God gave her to make it up for her! At least, this was what Stella Lindsay thought to herself. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Grace, it would be best if she did not remember it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina specifically asked Grace out. "Has your grandmother's funeral been taken care of?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace nodded her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you see your father?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. Even at her grandmother's funeral, her father never showed up. Of course, no one could get in touch with her father at all. Ever since her father and stepmother moved away from Emerald City, it was like they had disappeared. No one knew where they went.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, if she really wanted to know, she could just talk to Jason and she should be able to find out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not want to know. Her father, stepmother, and Evelyn were no longer family to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe Jason was her only family from now on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was speechless about her best friend's father. "Are you going to mourn now that your grandmother's dead?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she were to mourn, she must not marry for a certain period.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm going to," said Grace. Although she was only a maternal granddaughter and according to some customs, she was considered an &lsquo;outsider&rsquo;, she did not feel like an outsider and naturally wanted to mourn for her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long are you going to mourn?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A year, I guess," replied Grace.</p></div>
