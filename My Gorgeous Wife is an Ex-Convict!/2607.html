        <h1>Chapter 2605</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla also stopped and looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you didn't come back when Mr. Weiss was seriously ill after his operation and ignored him when he was most in need, why did you come back now? Mr. Weiss is going to divorce you, isn't he? But you still want to cling to the title of Mrs. Weiss. Do you think the divorce terms aren't good enough, so you want to ask for more?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls questioned, but she looked and spoke as if she were the mistress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's face darkened as she said, "You have no right to question our marriage, Nurse Ruan. You're only a nurse taking care of my husband's health during this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Shana Nicholls was mad. The statement that she was only a nurse cut deeply into her nerves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was indeed only a nurse now, and the woman in front of her hogged the title of Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just pity Mr. Weiss for marrying a woman like you," snapped Shana Nicholls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, do you think you qualify to marry him?&rdquo; Kyla asked in reply, her dark eyes looking at Shana Nicholls as if they could see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls's face reddened instantly. She had no idea how she was going to answer that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls pressed her red lips together tightly and said nothing. However, she deliberately bumped Kyla's shoulder as she passed by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Kyla lost balance and fell to the bottom of the stairs. Her hand instinctively went for the railing beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, she fell several steps before managing to steady herself. She felt a fit of sharp pain in her ankle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla gasped and looked up toward Shana Nicholls at the top of the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls pursed her lips in disdain as she said in a nonchalant joking tone, "Hey, be careful when taking the stairs. It&rsquo;ll be a big deal if you tumble down the stairs due to your carelessness. People would think I pushed you down the stairs, and that's not a sin I can bear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said coldly, "If I do fall down the stairs, it'll be a crime you can&rsquo;t bear. I don't know what you're up to, but you'd better not do it again. I can even consider what you did earlier as attempted murder!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin had sacrificed so much to give her a chance to live. She cherished her life more than anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls's face turned even redder. "What are you talking about? Don't make any accusations! It happened because you didn't step on the steps properly!" With that said, Shana Nicholls hurried away guiltily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together as she limped down the stairs. She found a chair, rolled up her pant leg, and looked at her ankle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, her ankle was already swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In this case, she would probably need to apply some medicine to it. Otherwise, the swelling would be so bad that she would have trouble walking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Kyla found a servant and asked where the medical kit was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no medical kit here. Go to Nurse Ruan for medicine, but she's only in charge of Mr. Weiss," the servant said without any respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's attitude toward Mrs. Weiss these days was obvious to the servants in the mansion.</p></div>
