        <h1>Chapter 1565</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina then took her phone to the corridor outside the office and said to her mother, "Mom, I'll find a boyfriend myself. Don't worry about it. And stop finding me blind dates. You've found plenty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So you know there's been plenty! It's been a few years. You're not 28 anymore but 33 now. Before long, you're going to be an old woman. Women older than 35 years old will have trouble finding a partner!" Mrs. Sweeney persuaded earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's eyes dimmed. She understood her mother's worries and anxiety. They were afraid she would be alone with no one to take care of her after they passed away. If she missed the ideal childbearing age range, she would end up childless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she did not think that she would not be able to live alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could live a good life alone. At worst, she could find a nursing home when she was old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she wanted her parents to stop worrying about her. They had worried enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, okay. I understand. Give me his contact information. I'll contact him later to meet up tonight, okay?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Sweeney ended the call with satisfaction after hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Soon, Lina received the man's phone number and personal information from her mother on WeChat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina sighed gently. Maybe it was just as her mother had said. She was already 33 years old, not 28. She was not young anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It had been five years. She should have gotten over Hadwin Stephenson by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, a voice in her heart asked... if she had really gotten over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Putting away her phone, Lina walked toward her office. However, when she passed by the general office area, a colleague suddenly stopped her and said, "Lina, your ex-boyfriend has come to Emerald City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The exclamation was heard by everyone in the general office. Many people instantly looked her way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at the person who spoke. It was Holly Greer, another senior employee in the office. She was here when she was dating Hadwin Stephenson back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Holly Greer had made a lot of sarcastic remarks about her back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Lina was stunned when she said her ex-boyfriend had come to Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many senior employees knew she had only one ex-boyfriend&mdash;Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He's... here in Emerald City?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As if to clarify her doubts, a new employee asked Holly Greer curiously, "Holly, who is Lina's ex-boyfriend? Is he famous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course. The chairman of Stephenson Group. Isn't he famous?" Holly Greer sounded as if she was joking, but her eyes flashed with satisfaction and contempt for Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'So what if Lina dated Hadwin Stephenson back then? She ended up getting dumped!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was now worse off than her. She married a man from a good family and was now living a much better life than Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as Holly Greer uttered Hadwin Stephenson's name, many people in the office who had just joined the company in the last five years revealed a look of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Lina and the chairman of Stephenson Group used to date?'</p></div>
