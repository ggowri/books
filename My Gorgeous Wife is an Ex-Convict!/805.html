        <h1>Chapter 804</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was even as if he had discovered for the first time that she could be more resolute than he previously imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could hurt herself casually, but when he saw the blood oozing from her body, he felt cold. Every nerve in his body seemed to be tingling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It&rsquo;s as if she had thrust the broken glass into my body!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It hurts so much!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his pain and anger now made Kyla laugh. When she laughed, the blood in her abdomen oozed faster!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't laugh!" He panicked, afraid that she would be bleeding too fast and too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She laughed as if she was mocking his panic right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This way, am I paying you a life?" Kyla asked with some difficulty. She could feel the blood pouring out, but she would not die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had suffered too many injuries in prison. She had faced too many injuries that they made her a doctor of some sort, so she knew that such an injury would not kill her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did this just to make Martin Weiss understand her determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can go on for the rest of my life without having a baby, or you can have the doctor take my uterus out. Of course, it could&rsquo;ve been already damaged and I may not be able to have another child at all," Kyla said with some difficulty, her eyes mocking the pale man in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no color in his face now, and his dark eyes were full of tension, pain, and panic as if he&hellip; cared about her. She might have thought so if she had not witnessed his ruthlessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was just afraid that she would not be able to give him and Paisley Daniels a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, is it all right... I pay you with this?" Her blood trickled down the glass and her fingers, dripping on the fine carpet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were staring at her, but he could not say a word! He had never thought she could be so unyielding!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so unyielding that he felt fear rise within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she would crumble to pieces and disappear completely before his eyes if he went any further!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was sent to the hospital by the ambulance, and Martin Weiss went with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was wheeled into the operating room, he sat on a bench in the hallway outside, staring blankly at his bloody hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This is... her blood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She would hurt herself to reject me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands... were still trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop shaking!' He kept telling himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This is what she deserves. She owes me and Paisley a child. She made Paisley infertile. Even... having the last name &lsquo;Carbyn&rsquo; is a sin!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if a woman like her died on the operating table today, he would have nothing to feel guilty about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his mind would somehow recall what she said to him as she hugged him with a wide smile. "Martin, I want to give you a baby. Um, not just one, but lots and lots of babies, alright? Do you like boys or girls... I'll just become a housewife since I don't have much career ambition anyway. I prefer to spend more time with you and the children..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had another sudden pain in his chest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss immediately pounded on his chest as if to stop the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did I think of that again? I've spent so much time looking for her after her release from prison just to take my revenge!'</p></div>
