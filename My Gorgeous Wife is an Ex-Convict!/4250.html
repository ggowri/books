        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina called home and informed them that Kit had been beaten up in an alley and that she was currently at the hospital with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you hurt?" Lina asked worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Tina replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll come pick you up now!" Lina said hurriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I'll come back after Kit wakes up. The doctor said he'll wake up in a while," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina sighed slightly over the phone, "Alright then, I'll have the driver wait at the hospital to pick you up later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Tina agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ending the call with her mother, she turned and walked to the bedside, looking down at Kit lying on the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was covered in bandages, making him look like a fragile doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she could have just stood by and watched, or even called the police, why did her body rush forward first?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Chandler hadn't coincidentally appeared today, maybe her situation would be worse than Kit's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina thought to herself as she pulled out her phone and started browsing news about Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's worth mentioning that the internet has a memory, even things from a long time ago can be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of that, she could find out about Kit's past and learn about his days of fame as a celebrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more famous he was in the past, the more it highlighted his current downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many people, from fame to downfall, can't help but want to take shortcuts and return to fame?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was completely different!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, Kit slowly opened his eyes, and when he saw Tina sitting by the bedside, he was clearly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina!" he couldn't help but exclaim, but his voice was very hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your condition isn't very good right now, don't talk too much," she said. "You fainted earlier, so Chandler and I brought you to the hospital. The admission procedures have been taken care of, and a caregiver has been arranged. The doctor said your condition needs a detailed examination tomorrow, and if there are no major issues, you can be discharged in a couple of days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit's eyes dimmed after hearing Chandler's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he saw her being dragged by someone like Walter in the alley, being threatened! He wanted to stand up, to help her fend off the danger, but he couldn't do anything. Instead, it was because of him that she was dragged into danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he had to be taken to the hospital by Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Chandler were really so different!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling of inferiority almost enveloped him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The situation has been resolved. Walter won't come bothering you again," Tina said. "</span><span>So</span><span> rest well, I'll go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina said that and was about to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit twisted his neck, struggling to sit up. "Why did you save me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you once saved me," Tina replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she told herself the same thing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would save him, only because he had saved her, so she would do anything to save him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from that, there was no other reason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit smiled bitterly. "Then next time, if a situation like this happens again, please don't save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at Kit somewhat surprised, feeling that at this moment, he seemed to be filled with an indescribable sadness.</span></p></div>
