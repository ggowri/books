        <h1>Chapter 949</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finally managed to hook up with Curtis Row and got him to change his mind to bring her here instead of his starlet girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to use this banquet to expand her network.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Curtis Row was in no mood to pay attention to the beautiful woman's coquettish behavior. All he could think about was... what he should do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sent Grace back to the rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm a little tired and I want to go to bed early." What Grace said was equivalent to ordering Jason to leave. However, he had no intention of leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He nonchalantly lifted strands of hair from her cheek and twirled them with his fingers. "Did you really tell Brian that you wouldn't love me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips, looking at the face close at hand before saying, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's expression changed immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I should continue to love you after we&rsquo;ve broken up?" she asked with some amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who would you love then?" Jason asked after keeping quiet for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No matter who else I choose to love after this, I wouldn't love you anymore. I'm your sister and you're my brother, right?" She suddenly smiled at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the smile seemed so glaring to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you fall in love with Brian?" he asked, staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent... Falling in love with Brian was something she had never imagined. Brian was her childhood friend who had gone through thick and thin with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and Brian might have had a friendship, but love&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not answer the question and only said, "Do you think falling in love is easy? Jason, you never believed my love for you when you were dating me, did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his thin lips. Then, he put his arms around her while his lips got closer to her ear. He croaked out the words, "Don't fall in love with Brian, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All he knew was that if she fell in love with Brian, he would be mad with jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want her to fall in love with anyone else, even if they were now broken up and she was only his sister!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is falling in love with someone else alright then?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who are you going to fall in love with? Chase Harper?" The ordinary man flashed into his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This has nothing to do with Chase Harper. I won't fall in love with Chase Harper!" she said immediately, not wanting to involve Chase Harper in their mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that you care a lot about Chase Harper. You can't wait to distance yourself from him. What's the matter? Are you afraid that I'll do something to him?" Jason said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more anxious she was to distance herself from Chase Harper, the more she seemed to care about the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What&rsquo;s so good about the man who seems worthless to me? Why would she defend him like that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just don't want to involve the innocent. Chase Harper's a good guy. Besides, we're just close because of the case I'm working on," explained Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A good guy?" Jason suddenly sneered. His warm breath sprayed on Grace's ears. "You said I was a good guy too, Sis."</p></div>
