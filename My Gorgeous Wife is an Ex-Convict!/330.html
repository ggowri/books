        <h1>Chapter 329</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace walked into the building with the trolley, the receptionist greeted her, asking only for her name. She did not even ask her to register and offered to help her press the button for the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All this led to Grace's speculation to drift in one direction. When she arrived at the address listed on the order, a tall woman in a business suit came over. "Miss Cummins? I ordered the food. You can just leave these here, and please take these two to the president's office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart dropped for a moment, and her speculation earlier began to come to light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The president's office... Jason was the president of Reed Group. Were these two for Jason's office?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace picked two up and walked toward Jason's office. Standing in front of the dark wooden door, she took a deep breath before knocking twice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come in." A voice came from inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pushed the door open and walked in, only to find Jason sitting at his desk. He was reviewing the papers with his head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll leave your order on the coffee table," said Grace as she pursed her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked up and looked at Grace as she walked to the coffee table to drop off the food. "Why are you in such a hurry?" As he spoke, he got up and walked around the desk to her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have to go back to the restaurant and deliver the other orders," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you had lunch?" he said out of nowhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked in a daze, not knowing how to react all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems you haven't eaten. Then you can eat with me. I'd like to try the food from the restaurant you're working at, Sis," he said as he grabbed her. Then, he put his hands on her shoulders and pushed her down on the sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She subconsciously wanted to stand up, but the force on her shoulders made it impossible for her to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." She glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? You don&rsquo;t want to dine with me?" he asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm really in a hurry," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Danger seemed to creep into his eyes. "In that case, I might as well return all of this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and suddenly realized that the person in front of her was Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could someone like Jason accept rejection so easily? If all these food were returned, Kyla would have a lot to lose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Kyla's small restaurant might go out of business if he wanted to do something to it after canceling the order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just one meal?" she asked after she calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled. "What else is there to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said as he removed his hands from her shoulders and turned to open the food's packaging on the coffee table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had long fingers and well-defined joints. Even the shape of his nails was pretty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was just removing a plastic bag, a pair of hands like his could make people feel its beauty and attract their attention. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took out two lunch boxes and helped her break off the disposable chopsticks before handing them to her.</p></div>
