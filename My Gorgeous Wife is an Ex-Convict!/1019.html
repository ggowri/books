        <h1>Chapter 1018</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at the person in front of her in confusion. 'What does he mean?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't love me and want to forget me because we broke up, then... let's get back together and return to how we were," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not the kind of man to change his decision upon making his mind, but this time, he went back on his word. It was like a slap in the face, and it was all just because of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because her not loving him and wanting to forget him were so unbearable to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed. She laughed so hard that her nose was sore and she could hardly hold back her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He casually wanted to break up on the same day of my birthday and knocked me down from heaven to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now, he&rsquo;s talking about getting back together and returning to how we were before... How we were before? How can I ever go back to being the same like we used to again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you going to love me again now?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes fluttered a little while his eyes grew darker. 'Actually... I&rsquo;ve always loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I thought I could easily do it, but in the end, she was the one who did it easily!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I still love you? Can you love me again?" he asked hoarsely. He loved her. Therefore, his life, joys, and sorrows could all be handed over to her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, he finally understood that he had been doomed to never escape the moment he fell in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His struggles had all been in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he heard her saying, "Jason, I can never fall in love with you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, his blood felt as if it had frozen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the investigation report his men sent to his phone. Grace would have been surprised if she was there because it was the medical record of all the injuries she suffered in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face grew colder and colder as he read the pages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain she had suffered was far worse than he imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Furthermore, the wounds on her fingers were caused by Lily and Sean!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not imagine how she must have felt when she suffered such pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always looked on coldly at many people and things, but he could not look on coldly when it came to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lily... Sean..." Brian muttered the two names. 'I'll get payback for everything Grace has suffered.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master, Miss Lindsay is here. She said she has something important to talk to you about," reported the butler as he entered the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian put away his phone and ordered softly, "Tell her to wait for me in the living room. I'll be there in a minute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," answered the butler as he withdrew from the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his hand and touched his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... hurting for the woman who had suffered so much in prison.</p></div>
