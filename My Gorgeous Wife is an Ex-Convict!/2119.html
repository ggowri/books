        <h1>Chapter 2117</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze and looked at Martin Weiss with a puzzled face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just want to know... whether you're willing to trust me again? Will you believe every word I say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Does it matter whether I trust you or not?" Kyla asked flatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," he said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Okay then. I trust you. I trust that you&rsquo;ll do as you promised. Just like how we got a marriage license after you agreed to marry me. You also agreed to divorce me in the future, so I reckon you&rsquo;ll keep your word then as well.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's heart that had just felt joy sank again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One moment, he was happy that she said she trusted him. However, he felt as if he had been sent to hell the next moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you believe I love you, then?" Martin Weiss asked with trembling lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at him with some shock. It was as if she was wondering why he had suddenly brought this up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the staff member handling their birth permission certificate called Kyla to collect the certificate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla hurriedly got up and took the birth permission certificate. She said to Martin Weiss, "Alright, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had only taken two steps when he suddenly grasped her arm. "You haven't answered my question."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla sighed, turned to look at him, and said, "Martin Weiss, I believe that you think you love me and that some of the things you say to me are true. But... do you really think you love me? Or is it just guilt and regret? You don't love me that much at all. When we first met each other, wasn&rsquo;t everything just an act? You pretended to love me, and I believed that. Perhaps people would sometimes pretend for so long that they would even start believing it&rsquo;s real.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss looked blankly at Kyla and said hoarsely, "So do you think... I'm just deceiving myself that I love you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Back when we were together, you didn't really fall in love with me. You were willing to trust Paisley Daniels instead. Did you fall in love with me during the many years we were apart, then?" Her nonchalance seemed to be taunting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Kyla yanked her arm back forcefully and turned around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was still standing there in a trance. He felt a hint of bitterness in his mouth. It turned out she did not believe he loved her at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe she stopped believing when he testified against her in court?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, could he accept it? Could he accept having things remain the same until their divorce? No! He would not accept it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss quickly ran in front of Kyla, stopped her, and said, "Kyla, I know it's hard for you to trust me again after all that I've done. I do feel guilty and regretful to you. But I didn&rsquo;t fall in love with you because of this. I&rsquo;ve loved you from the very beginning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla only looked at him silently. Though he spoke lovingly, nothing stirred in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's mouth filled with bitterness, and he finally said something he had never told her before. "You know what? It was... love at first sight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Yes. When he first met her, he felt as if something had struck him as she stood there and smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when he first approached her, he knew she was the target of his revenge and the daughter of his enemy. Hence, the more he loved her, the more he kept repressing his feelings.</p></div>
