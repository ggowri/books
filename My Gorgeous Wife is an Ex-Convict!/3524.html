        <h1>Chapter 3522</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From now on, don't call me Mason anymore. You can call me by my full name, Mason Reed, or just Reed or Mr. Reed," his cold voice rang out. "And there's nothing left for us to talk about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're still angry with me, aren't you? I know, I shouldn't have..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before she could finish her sentence, he had already lifted his other hand and grabbed her left hand that was originally holding onto his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her left hand felt a sharp pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She let out a low cry and furrowed her eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't want your hand to get hurt, then let go," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She tightly bit her lip, but was unwilling to easily let go of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unexplainably, at this moment she had a feeling that once she let go, she and him might never be able to return to how they were before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Veronica endured the pain and continued to hold onto Mason's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, I really...have a lot to say to you," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I remember I made it clear to you on the phone that you're no longer my Veronica since then, so there's no need to call me Mason anymore," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her body trembled and her face turned pale. "You... are you really going to completely cut ties with me because of a misunderstanding?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not just a misunderstanding between us," he replied. "And I'll say it again, let go, otherwise you'll only end up hurting yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it's not just a misunderstanding, then what else is there? What else is there that requires you to completely cut ties with me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because you only see me as a 'little brother'," he said, slowly leaning down and bringing his cheek close to hers. "But don't worry, from now on, I won't have any feelings for you anymore. The feelings I had before are nothing to me now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her pupils suddenly shrank. "I... I don't understand what you mean by that. What do you mean by 'nothing to me now'?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he forcefully pressed a finger causing a sharp pain that caught her off guard, coming from her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" She cried out in pain, and her fingers that were gripping his hand finally let go uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because I have forgotten all those emotions," his voice echoed in her ear, and his fingers also released her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared blankly as his figure disappeared little by little from her sight. She wanted to lift her feet and catch up with him, but her feet felt heavy, and her body trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forgotten?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did he use the word "forgot"?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just now, his expression and tone of voice when talking to her were completely different from before, as if she really didn't mean anything to him anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica lowered her head and looked at the red mark on her wrist. This was the bruise left by him pinching her wrist just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He used to be unwilling to let her suffer any harm. If anyone hurt her, he would do everything to help her get justice. But now... she was hurt by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A feeling of fear spread through her body, as if telling her that she might lose something...</p></div>
