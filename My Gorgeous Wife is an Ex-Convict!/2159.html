        <h1>Chapter 2157</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As if she had discovered something new, Jasper said with a smile, "The baby's yawning. Haha, she looks so cute when she yawns! Nelson, did you see the baby yawn just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," Mick Reed replied lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn said, "It seems Tina's comfortable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">" Tina, hurry and grow up. I have a lot of beautiful dolls. I'll give you some to play with when the time comes!" Jasper appeared like a big sister. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Tina Stephenson seemed to understand this. The corners of her lips curved as if she was smiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Jasper became even more excited. "Look, Nelson. Tina's smiling at me. Does she like me too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, she must really like you," Nelson Corbyn said gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William felt like a fifth wheel as he watched the scene unfold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked down and slowly walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He should not have come here in the first place. He had nothing to do with this place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William went out to the corridor. When he passed the window, he happened to see Veronica Barlow and Mason talking about something in the back garden. After a while, Veronica Barlow took the initiative to embrace Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William watched the scene on tiptoes and felt a little disappointed. If only Jasper could hug him like that too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked down and squatted not far from the stairway, where the people downstairs would not see him. aunt Cummins and the rest would not ask him why he had left the room alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the garden, Veronica Barlow was embracing Mason as she kept saying, "Alright, you're cuter than Tina. I like you the most, Mason. I will hug you every day from now on, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason had dragged her to the garden. Unexpectedly, Mason kept asking her whether he or Tina Stephenson was cuter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After that, he even insisted that she hug him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Veronica Barlow thought Mason was a little petty. She just wanted to hug Tina because she thought she was cute, but he looked unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you going to hold me like Tina?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're too big for me to hold you like that!" said Veronica Barlow. Besides, she was not strong enough to hold him like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then... don't carry her again. I don't like it," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't you like her? Tina's so cute," Veronica Barlow said in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason nodded. He disliked Tina Stephenson because she liked Tina Stephenson. "You're my sister. Didn't you say you like me the most?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Uh, I do like you the most, but I can like other people too," muttered Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at Mason's unhappy face, she reluctantly said, "Okay, okay, I won't carry Tina Stephenson anymore." She probably would not have the chance to come here again anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I can&rsquo;t carry the baby if I don&rsquo;t see her!&rsquo; Veronica Barlow thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason finally smiled and asked Veronica Barlow to hug him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But you're a boy, Mason. You can't be so petty. Though I like you the most, I&rsquo;ll like someone else too someday," Veronica Barlow could not help saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For example, her best friend Kay had secretly told her that she had a boyfriend. Kay's boyfriend was the gym class representative from the next class, and he was good at playing basketball. Kay also said that her boyfriend would buy her soda every day, and he was good to her.</p></div>
