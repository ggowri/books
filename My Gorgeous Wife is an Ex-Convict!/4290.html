        <h1>Chapter 4288 She Was the Only One in Love</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley suddenly felt a sense of disappointment. His words were like a bucket of cold water, extinguishing the excitement she had felt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that he didn't really want to introduce her to his classmates. Her existence was just a shield.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you not like that girl named Eva?" She bit her lip and asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell smirked and replied, "No, I don't like her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case..." She paused, gathering all her courage, "Do you have someone you like?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," his answer was expected, but it still hurt when she heard it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was she hoping for? Did she expect him to say that he liked her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their engagement was never based on his feelings for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell silent for a moment and suddenly said, "If one day, you meet someone you like, we can dissolve the engagement."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell raised an eyebrow, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. Then he smiled and said, "I thought you would ask me to like you. Are you trying to dissolve the engagement?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley self-deprecatingly replied, "We've known each other for so many years. If you were going to like me, you would have already. Since you haven't, it's unlikely you will in the future. So, the only way I can repay you is by dissolving the engagement when you find someone you like."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think dissolving the engagement is a repayment for me?" he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want any other form of repayment, just tell me. You saved my life, and if it's within my abilities, I will repay you. If it's beyond my abilities, I will find a way!" she earnestly declared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her serious attitude made him feel somewhat displeased in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looks like she could abandon their engagement at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you thought about the consequences of breaking the engagement with the Quentin family?" he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the engagement was so easily made and broken, he wouldn't have made it with her all those years ago, when he wanted to save her life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it's the Crypt families, certain rules must be followed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rules must not be broken! It's the Quentin family's principle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, the Quentin family's rule is to take back what they have given!" Harley replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So when we made the engagement all those years ago to save you, are you planning to compensate the Quentin family with a life if you want to break the engagement now?" Lornell stared at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't have to be a life, it can be a compensation similar to what you did to save me back then," Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what do you think would be a similar compensation?" Lornell asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley remained silent, not saying anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell said, "Since this engagement was made between you and me all those years ago, let's just continue like this. After all, I don't have anyone I like, and the Hart family matches the Quentin family's status, so marrying you won't be a problem."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you don't love me, is it okay to marry me?" Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, you love me, don't you?" he smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a bitter taste spreading in her throat. Yes, she liked him... he always knew.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this engagement, she was the only one who liked him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he, he never felt the kind of liking for her, he just thought she was suitable, that's all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if she wasn't the daughter of the Hart family if she didn't have the surname Hart, would he even spare her a second glance?</span></p></div>
