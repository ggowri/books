        <h1>Chapter 336</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips together and did not know what to say all of a sudden, so she opened her lunch box and started to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes were fixed on Grace. It seemed to gradually become a taboo as he tried to keep her by his side again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to let her leave. He only thought about what he should do so that she would willingly stay with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since when did having lunch together become something he looked forward to? He could eat with her just like that. He was happy even if they were only eating in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think about it, his happiest days were probably from when he was &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;. At least she would josh with him, treat him as an ordinary person, lovingly dry his hair, and call him &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jay... Jay...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she know how much he wanted to hear her call him that as if she were calling for her most important family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace finished eating and looked up, she looked straight into Jason's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was watching her and had not even touched the lunchbox in his hands. In other words, he had been watching her the whole time she was eating?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face suddenly turned red at the thought of this possibility. She quickly stood up and said, "I... I got to go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she bent down to clear away her lunchbox that was on the coffee table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his hand to the back of hers. Then, he tilted his chin back a little and stared at her. "Can you call me Jason, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mutters sounded like he was begging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body stiffened, and her throat seemed to burn all of a sudden. "Why... are you suddenly...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Call me Jay. I want to hear you call me Jason now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her red lips and did not utter a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face inched closer to hers. "Can't you just call me that once?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly felt that the tip of her nose was full of his smell. Seeing that his lips were about to attach to hers, she hurriedly cried out, "Jay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips stopped just short of hers as he smiled. "That's nice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if her face was burning a little hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment his hand let go of hers, she pretty much ran out of the president's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the office, Jason looked down at the hand that had just touched the back of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A long time passed before he slowly gathered his hands as if trying to hold on to the temperature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After cleaning up the restaurant at night, Kyla Corbyn handed Grace a book about sign language. "This is a book about sign language. You can read this if you want to learn it."</p></div>
