        <h1>Chapter 2768</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson was surprised that he knew his surname was Lu. 'This guy is...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson began to size up his outfit. However, the more he looked at the man, the more shocked he was, especially at the sight of the watch on his wrist... Stewart Watson loved watches, so he could tell at a glance that the watch that Brian wore was a global limited edition. There were only three watches in the world, and the price was up to tens of millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Cold sweat instantly broke out on his back. No ordinary people could afford to wear such a watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides... The more he looked at his face, the more familiar he looked. It was as if he had seen him before. He just could not recall it all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stewart, don't let him intimidate you. Who does he think he is? Anyone can intimidate others by saying such words. I can do the same. I can say that I can kill his family in three days&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Rhea Oliver could finish speaking, Valda Theller had lunged forward and snapped, "Shut up! Rhea Oliver, I don't care what you say about me, but I won't go easy on you if you talk about my boyfriend's family like that! I, Valda Theller, will do what I say!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver was shocked by Valda Theller. Besides, Valda Theller's expression was full of threatening malice, making Rhea Oliver's heart shudder. For a moment, she was unable to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson came back to his senses at once. He hurriedly grabbed Rhea Oliver and said, "Alright, let's go. It's embarrassing to cause a commotion here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver clenched her teeth. She even glared at Valda Theller before leaving. She wanted to say something to scare her, but those words seemed stuck in her throat when she caught a glimpse of Brian's icy gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She eventually just said, "Just wait and see." Then, Rhea Oliver angrily left with Stewart Watson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned to look at Brian. "I'm sorry I involved you in this and caused you and your family to be cursed by Rhea Oliver like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian replied, "You don't need to apologize. It's not your fault anyway. People like that will receive the consequences of their evil deeds. Don't let people like that affect your mood. Let's take a look at the necklace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said as he glanced out the corners of his eyes in the direction where Rhea Oliver and Stewart Watson left. His eyes were filled with sarcasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded, calmed herself, and examined the necklace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The limited edition necklace was made of platinum and set with amethyst. The material itself was not expensive. The entire necklace cost nearly 50,000 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller immediately paid for it with a swipe of her card, which made Brian raise his eyebrows in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said she would pay for the necklace, but it was not cheap for her. However, she bought it without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Walking out of the shopping mall, Valda Theller looked at the beautifully wrapped jewelry box like it was her treasure. She could not help smiling as she imagined what Camille Strickland would look like when she received the gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You and your friend must be close," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you mean Camille?" asked Valda Theller. She nodded. "We're indeed close. It was Camille who helped me when I was bullied during university. Later, I decided to make a living for myself through comics. She WAS the one who kept encouraging me. When I didn't have enough money to start my own studio, she lent me her savings without a word. She&rsquo;s kind to me, and I've always been grateful to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's indeed kind to you," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it's a pity there's nothing I can do to repay her. I think she'll be happy I bought her a necklace she likes. I hope she can enjoy her birthday this year," murmured Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She&rsquo;ll have a good time," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope so," Valda Theller said with a smile.</p></div>
