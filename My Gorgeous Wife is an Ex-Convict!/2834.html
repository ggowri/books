        <h1>Chapter 2832</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was wondering who became Young Master Hart's girlfriend. I didn't expect it to be a comic artist. She's probably not popular. I've never heard of her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A woman like her probably just wants to find a rich husband.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They talked as if no one was there, and their tone was full of contempt for Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some even looked at Valda Theller with disdain and said, "Why don't you tell us how you fooled Young Master Hart into becoming your boyfriend?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the people in front of her. Judging from their outfits, they were probably socialites of Emerald City like Phoebe Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were looking at her maliciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think the 'Young Master Hart' you speak of is a person who gets fool easily?" Valda Theller asked in reply. She knew she could not show weakness. Showing weakness would only make these people push their luck as well as embarrass Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." The expression of the woman who asked the question turned ghastly. "What a smart mouth! I've met a lot of women like you. Do you really think&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really think you're Young Master Hart's true love and you can change your fate after marrying into a rich family? I'm afraid you'll get dumped before long. Is that what you want to say?" Valda Theller interrupted and finished what the woman wanted to say in one breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman felt like something was stuck in her throat. She could not spit it out nor swallow it. She subconsciously raised her hand to swing it toward Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller warned, "I'm Brian's girlfriend. Forget about the future. At least he loves me very much right now. What do you think he&rsquo;ll do to you if you lay your hands on me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman instantly turned pale. Cold sweat broke out on her forehead as she thought of what Brian would do. She could not swing the hand she had raised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The makeup room became silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Displeased, Phoebe Cross said to Valda Theller, "You seem so full of yourself. Brian has had many girlfriends. Brian changed girlfriends every once in a while a few years back. We're only reminding you out of kindness, lest you get dumped and want to attempt suicide!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Phoebe Cross's gaze fell on Valda Theller's blue gown. "Is this gown from Brian? You can say Brian loves you when you get Brian to give you a purple gown. I think Brian is just after the novelty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's heart sank. 'Purple gown... Purple again. I know it's Grace's favorite color.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whether it's love or novelty is between Brian and me. You have nothing to worry about, Miss Song."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's face darkened. "Valda Theller, who do you think you are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Valda Theller could speak, a graceful male voice rang out. "Phoebe Cross, you can't speak to my girlfriend like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a sudden silence, and all eyes looked toward the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A tall figure walked over slowly, his handsome face full of indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross was shocked. 'How much did Brian hear?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked to Valda Theller's side. "It seems I should&rsquo;ve come earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;re not too late," said Valda Theller, relieved by his appearance. Even though she seemed undaunted by Phoebe Cross, only she knew her palms were full of cold sweat when she dissed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like the gown and jewelry I chose?" Brian bent over and asked in a mutter. His tone sounded doting.</p></div>
