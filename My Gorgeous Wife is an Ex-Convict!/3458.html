        <h1>Chapter 3456</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it was only today that he truly felt the power of Mason's aristocratic identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two families, who were already on edge, surprisingly reconciled because of a few words from Mason! Is this the power of the wealthy? It's truly hard to know what to say about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, everything was calm and peaceful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">MasonGrace still lives with the Reed family, and Veronica and Daniel's relationship is still ongoing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica asked Mason if he planned to live with the Reed family forever, but Mason never gave her a direct answer. He only said, "When Veronica needs me in the future, I will naturally go back to live with the Barlow family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt that Mason's tone was strange when he said these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When does he need it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One year has passed quickly. During this year, rumors about Veronica and Mason have stopped because of Veronica's relationship with Daniel. At most, there are only rumors about the Barlow family trying to gain favor with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During winter break, Veronica and Mason couldn't see each other every day like they did at school. Veronica didn't want to bother Mason by going to the Reed House too often, so they only greeted each other online and chatted for a while every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Daniel, during winter break, he often invited her to hang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, how did your family celebrate the New Year these past few days?" asked Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"On New Year's Eve, we just stay at home. But on the first day of the Lunar New Year, we have to go to the Reed family's house to pay our respects. And for the following days..." Veronica paused for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, she went with the Reed family to visit other families for the New Year. Mason always liked to stick with her, so if she didn't go, Mason wouldn't go either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So unconsciously, this pattern became established.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this year... it probably won't happen, Veronica thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one can't live without someone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like how Mason used to cling to her before, but as they grew up, he eventually stopped clinging to her. He has even been living with the Reed family for a year now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's happening in the next few days?" Daniel asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much," said Veronica. But when she said this, she felt a hollow feeling in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then in the following days, let's schedule a time to go mountain climbing and also visit some temples. On the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, we can even worship the God of Wealth!" said Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica couldn't help but laugh, "Do you want to worship the God of Wealth? When did you become so superstitious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, saying goodbye is not a big deal. Besides, if I become rich in the future, I can make your life better!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The future? Veronica blushed, thinking that's too far away to consider...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the day of New Year, the Barlow family of three celebrated at home. The Archer couple were discussing how to properly flatter the Reed family and Mason when they visit them on the first day of the new year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt a sense of excitement at the thought of seeing Mason tomorrow at the Reed family's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When I can't see Mason, I miss him a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Veronica finally met Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason, dressed in a black suit, looks different from his usual self. In the past year, he has grown taller, reaching almost 180cm. His cold and distant demeanor also attracts many girls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica knows that Mason is already the most admired boy among the girls in school, and there are also many girls from other schools who come to their school just to catch a glimpse of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, I went to visit the Reed family for the New Year. There were also many relatives of the Reed family present. However, those relatives who had previously met people from the Barlow family would come over and try to flatter them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, today the attitude towards the Barlow family is very cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica naturally understands the reason behind it. After all, Mason has been living with the Reed family for a year now. Unless there are any special circumstances in the future, he will probably continue to live with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow family was just a passing scenery in his life.</p></div>
