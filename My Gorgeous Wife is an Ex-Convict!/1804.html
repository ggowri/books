        <h1>Chapter 1802</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll have someone tidy up the place later," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh," said Grace as she blushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason helped Grace clean up and changed her into a clean hospital gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"By the way, Dr. Russell said I can be discharged in two days. I'd like to see Mason after that," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason had been discharged from the hospital, but he refused to live in Reed Residence no matter what. He wanted to go back to the He family&rsquo;s house just because Veronica Barlow lived there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace did not want Mason to become even more resistant to them, so after discussing with Jason, they decided to let him stay in the He family&rsquo;s house. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Of course, the He family agreed and were eager to take good care of Mason. However, Grace knew that the He family just wanted to get on the Reed family's good side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason replied, "Okay, if you want the child to move back to the Reed Residence, then I&rsquo;ll think of something else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not difficult for him to bring the little one back to Reed Residence, but he had to use some tricks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let's take it slow. After all, we've waited for five years. It doesn't matter if we need to wait a little longer for him to accept us and come back to Reed Residence,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then we'll do as you say." Jason agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the day Grace was discharged from the hospital, Lina was afraid she would give her best friend trouble if she went. After finding out that her best friend wanted to see Mason, she simply waited in Kyla's store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When school was about to end, Lina saw the small figure walking to the school gate. He was waiting for his beloved sister to come out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Mason was not alone this time. Archer Barlow and Rosalind Bush accompanied Mason. They looked just like two guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One was holding a thermos flask while the other was holding a variety of snacks and fruits. They crouched down from time to time, seemingly lovingly telling the little one something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the little one paid no attention to them. He looked straight at the school gate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How shameless of them! They used to treat Mason so badly. They&rsquo;ve completely changed their attitude now!" Lina said to Kyla when she saw this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But it's just as well. At least those two won&rsquo;t dare to do anything to Mason while he's in the He family&rsquo;s house," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes." Lina nodded. As she spoke, a black Bentley drove over. Grace and Jason got down from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the little one saw the ones he should call &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mommy&rsquo; appear, his face showed no joy but alarm. He took a few steps back, evidently not wanting to see them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace saw the alarmed expression on her son's face and felt her heart ache. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mason, I just came to see you, not take you away," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the look of alarm on the little one's face did not go away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said coldly, "It's a piece of cake if we want to take you away. You'd better not treat your mother like this, or I won't be kind to you even if you are my son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one finally asked, "Are you sure you're not here to take me away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We'll only bring you home when you&rsquo;re willing to go home with Daddy and me," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The look of alarm on the little one's face faded a little. However, when Grace tried to crouch down and hug him, he still backed away. He was clearly unwilling.</p></div>
