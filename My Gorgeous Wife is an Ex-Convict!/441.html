        <h1>Chapter 440</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was the darkest period of her life. She felt that there was no meaning for her to live on. If not for Lina who frequently came to visit her, she would not still be alive right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor sighed. &ldquo;Let the gynecologist have a look at your report and see if there is anything we can do.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Anything we can do?&rdquo; Grace was stunned for a moment. &ldquo;Are there any other ways?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still young. We can&rsquo;t tell you that there&rsquo;s no chance at all. Besides, in medicine, nothing is absolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, hope began to bud within Grace&rsquo;s heart. Even if she knew how small that hope was, it was still hope, was it not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If there was a way for her to treat her uterus, did that mean she could have a child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she thought about it, Jason&rsquo;s face appeared in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she could have a child, then the father of the child would be...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Alright, we&rsquo;re done. You can get up.&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s words interrupted Grace&rsquo;s daydream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately got up from the examination bed and adjusted her clothes. She could feel her rapid heart rate because of her earlier thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... wanted to have a child with Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed the nurse out of the ultrasound room. She did not need to wait for her report as everything would be collected and sent to her consulting doctor. That doctor would then go through her report and decide which specialist needed to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Grace did not expect was that Andrea, who was still in the queue, would once again approach her. She loudly questioned, &ldquo;Did you buy the VIP package for your health check-up? Aren&rsquo;t you working as a food delivery person? How did you afford to buy such an expensive package?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Andrea like she was a joke. The latter was acting as if she was a prosecutor whose questions Grace needed to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s my personal matter. I don&rsquo;t need to explain it to you.&rdquo; Grace mocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea realized that her tone earlier was rather overbearing. Thus, she put on an act. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just worried about you. You&rsquo;ve just come out of prison. What if you make the wrong move and have to face the law once again? You know that we lawyers are more sensitive about these things.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace coldly looked at Andrea, making the other woman feel rather sheepish. &ldquo;Why... are you looking at me like that?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Nothing. You just look as if you hope that I&rsquo;ll have a run-in with the law again,&rdquo; Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea nearly choked on her saliva. &ldquo;H-how can that be. We... We&rsquo;re ex-colleagues. Of course, I wish you well.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is that so? But you always like to mention my past in prison in front of others, as if you wish that everyone will know about this part of my past,&rdquo; Grace said without beating around the bush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea&rsquo;s complexion reddened in embarrassment. Her colleagues from the law firm were among those in the queue. They were all focused on the drama happening, so they heard what Grace said as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Subsequently, some of them had a look of a certain realization in their eyes. They all continued to wait for the drama to unfold further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I... That&rsquo;s because...&rdquo; Andrea wanted to make up an excuse, but the problem was, she could not think of any.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;A lawyer should know that the law enables a person to be sentenced with a crime from an objective manner. Even if that person has done thousands of crimes in the past, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that this time, that person is guilty. But when it comes to you, it seems as if you&rsquo;ve decided beforehand to label me as someone guilty. This is not how a professional lawyer should act,&rdquo; Grace coldly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her brutal words made Andrea&rsquo;s complexion redder. Grace had raised doubts about her professionalism, yet Andrea could not find a way to refute.</p></div>
