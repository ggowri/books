        <h1>Chapter 1591</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He grabbed her wrist. "I'm alright. My head doesn't hurt anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's good." She smiled and tried to withdraw her hand, but his hand was still firmly on her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay?" She looked at him quizzically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He pressed his lips together and said almost as if with great courage, "Are you sure... you didn't leave because you didn't love me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why do you ask me that all of a sudden? I told you, I must have left... for other reasons. It can&rsquo;t be that it was because I stopped loving you. I know you're the one I love! That's not going to change," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wanted to tell him everything if not for the fact that telling him the truth about falling into the sea would be too much for him to bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing, I just want to... make it clear. After all, I don't have many memories of the past," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace smiled. "Then I'll slowly tell you all about our past. Maybe you'll recover your memories by listening to me recount them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her. "Do you want me to recover my memories?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Of course, I hope you can recover your memories, but it's best to let nature take its course. There's no hurry. Maybe you'll recover your memories little by little when I tell you about the past bit by bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes glimmered, but... his memories had...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He let go of her wrist. Grace got out of bed, but her legs were weak and she fell forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason quickly caught Grace but frowned and grunted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace steadied herself. "Thank you," she said, but she was momentarily startled when her eyes fell on his hand. It was because the back of his hand was so full of bruises that it was shocking to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What happened to your hand..." she asked blankly, trying to take his hand and get a closer look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He abruptly withdrew his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked up and said, "Show me your hand. What on earth happened? Why are there so many bruises on it..." She trailed off in the middle of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was only now she saw that his lips were covered with wounds too. His lower lip was injured, and the cut seemed a little deep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How did you hurt your lower lip so badly?" Even if he had injured his lip by accident, it would not be this bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as though he had bit his lip with all his strength. Even Grace could not imagine how painful it must have been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I bit my lip by accident when I got up to get something to eat after you fell asleep last night. I also got these bruises when I bumped into something," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace showed a look of suspicion in her eyes. If he had really just bumped into things or bitten his lip, the wounds would not be this serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Show me your hands." She insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He hesitated for a moment before eventually stretching out his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace examined them. Other than the bruises on the back of his hands, there were several cuts in his palms that looked like they were caused by fingernails.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, what happened when I was asleep?" Grace asked solemnly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was silent for a moment before saying, "I had a headache again after you fell asleep yesterday. I accidentally hurt myself when I was in pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why didn't you wake me up when you were suffering from a headache? Have you seen a doctor?" she asked quickly.</p></div>
