        <h1>Chapter 2845</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the bus arrived at the bus stop and the door opened, Valda Theller saw Brian standing there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wore a white shirt with partial black stripes, black trousers, and leather shoes. He looked elegant and noble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He attracted attention like a prince in a fairy tale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller got off the bus and immediately felt everyone waiting for the bus looking in their direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long have you been waiting?" she asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Not too long. My car is parked nearby. Where do you want to eat tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't... we buy some ingredients from a nearby supermarket and go to my apartment for a simple hotpot?&rdquo; she said. They had bought ingredients and cooked themselves before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, they went to a nearby supermarket and started shopping for hotpot ingredients for the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller would look at Brian from time to time while shopping in the supermarket. When Brian looked at her, she immediately avoided him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I can't ask... Can I ask if he took off my gown last night?' Valda Theller lamented in her head. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he did, he was probably just worried she would not be comfortable sleeping in the gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the incident would haunt her if she did not ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After shopping at the supermarket, Brian drove to Valda Theller's apartment. The two got out of the car with the ingredients.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You seem to be taking peeks at me every now and then. Do you have something to tell me?" Brian's voice rang out suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly denied it and said, "Ah... It's... It's nothing. I... I just think you look good, especially in black and white."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" He stared at her thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded, but he still saw through the guilty expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked down and said nothing as he entered the elevator with Valda Theller and arrived at her apartment door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller opened the door, and the two went in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Put the ingredients on the marble counter in the kitchen," said Valda Theller before putting down the things she was holding. She suddenly felt a shadow loom over her. Brian came close and pressed her against the marble table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? You're a terrible liar. You have a guilty look on your face whenever you lie," he said as his thin lips parted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller bit her lip awkwardly and looked flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you might as well just tell me anything you want to say and save me all the guessing, okay?" Brian continued saying, his dark phoenix eyes staring straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt her heart beating fast again at that moment, and his eyes seemed to see right through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Valda Theller blushed and said, "Actually... I just wanted to ask... whether you changed me out of my gown and into my pajamas... last night&hellip; because... because I don't remember anything..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took her a lot of effort to say that.</p></div>
