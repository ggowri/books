        <h1>Chapter 3352</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Proof?" Valda was taken aback. "How...how can we prove that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As he spoke these words, he kissed her lips, and in that moment she understood what he meant by 'proof'."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She instinctively closed her eyes and immersed herself in the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His kiss was deep, almost leaving her breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I don't know how long it took, but Brian finally ended the kiss. Valda was panting and looked at him, noticing the clear desire in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I just gave birth to a child, so you may have to wait for a while, so..." she stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled slightly and said, "I know, don't worry. I won't do anything that would harm your health. I just want to hold you while we sleep. But in the future...you have to make up for what you owe me, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ambiguous language made her face even redder. Oh my, how did she not realize before that he was so good at saying things that make people blush and heart race!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt like her face was about to bleed, but when faced with Brian's gaze, she couldn't nod or shake her head. In the end, she could only awkwardly hug her husband's neck and bury her face in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked down at the person in his arms, a smile playing on his lips. His peripheral vision caught a glimpse of his daughter lying in the crib.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, the house will be much livelier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he, perhaps all the tenderness of his life, will be given to these two women!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William stayed in Emerald City for a week and is now returning to Deer Capital. Before leaving, he said to Jasper, "If you ever want to listen to me play the piano, feel free to call me and I'll play for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But didn't you say before that you were going to reduce the time you spend on playing the piano because you have many other things to learn and slowly give up playing the piano, right?" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just that I'll have less time to practice, but if you want to listen, I can still make time to play for you," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper bit his lip slightly and couldn't help but say, "William, you always seem to be very kind to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this not good?" asked William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I'm afraid I'm not worth you being so good to me," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's nothing unworthy about you," William said. "Jasper, you deserve me being good to you more than anyone else." Because she was the one who saved him from despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was her company that got him through the most painful time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, I'm going back now. I probably won't be able to stay in Emerald City for a while until summer," William said reluctantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When I have time, I can go to Deer Capital to see you!" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll wait for you," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Until Philip shouted, "William, it's time to board."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William then left with his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the plane, Philip said, "Jasper needs to let go of Lawrence's matter, but it may not happen so quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know," William said. "She will slowly let go of it in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence, who once made him worried and scared, has finally disappeared like this. He doesn't know when he will reappear, or maybe he will never appear again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Jasper will gradually forget Lawrence too, after all, she has only known him for less than a year.</p></div>
