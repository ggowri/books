        <h1>Chapter 1946</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For example, her son's plot against the Jackson family was all linked to one another. She was terrified after finding out about it later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She never thought that her son would set up such a plot and bring down the Jackson family in one fell swoop. Her son had gotten more shrewd over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, he was her son, and she had nothing to fear. All she had to do was enjoy her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, I'd like to go to bed if there's nothing else," said Hadwin Stephenson as he raised his hand and rubbed his brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers looked at her clearly exhausted son and said, "Okay, have a good rest. I'll go home first. It's your birthday in a few days and I'm throwing you a birthday party this year. I've also invited many of tMason Swansonty's influential people. Remember to show up on time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her son had broken up with Katherine Jackson this year, while Stephenson Group had taken over half of the Jackson family's businesses. She used to behave obsequiously with the Jackson family, but she could finally hold her head high now. She was spreading the word and would pick a wife she liked for her son at his birthday party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Got it," Hadwin Stephenson said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After Emily Flowers left, Hadwin Stephenson looked at the deserted house and could not help sneering. 'Is this what I used to fight for?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if he had gotten Stephenson Group and become the real head of the Stephenson family, it was nothing to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He still did not feel a sense of belonging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the ward, Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney asked their daughter what had happened that caused her to get so agitated that she almost miscarried again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina suddenly realized that her phone was not with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Right, Hadwin Stephenson has my phone!' The nurse gave Hadwin Stephenson her phone when the doctor examined her after he sent her to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's just that... there was something wrong with my phone, and the system erased all the photos in my album. My tummy hurt when I got agitated and was in the heat of the moment." Lina could only say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, dear. It's just a couple of photos. How serious could it be that you got yourself into the hospital?&rdquo; said Mr. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry for worrying you. I&rsquo;ll try my best to control my emotions from now on," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, okay. Don't get too triggered in the future. Even if you have any difficulty, we'll help you figure it out," said Mrs. Sweeney. Then, she discussed with Mr. Sweeney about staying the night to take care of their daughter. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just go back to the hotel and rest. You don't need to spend the night here. Didn't the doctor also say I'm doing fine? I just have to stay in the hospital for two days to make sure that the baby's safe before discharging."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But we're worried about having you stay in the hospital alone," said Mrs. Sweeney. Especially since the ward was a single ward, so no one would know if anything happened to her daughter if she was alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, two caretakers knocked on the door and entered the ward, stating that they were caretakers Hadwin Stephenson had hired. They would be responsible for taking care of Lina in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina immediately said to her parents, "Mom and Dad, you don't have to worry now. There are two people taking care of me at night. You should just go back to the hotel and rest. You can visit me and take care of me during the day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney finally went back to the hotel after seeing that there were two caretakers around. They were also persuaded by their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina lay down on the hospital bed to sleep after washing up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, she was tired after such a long day and soon fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two caretakers divided their duties. One would stay the night while the other went home to rest. They would switch duties later in the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The night was dark and the ward was quiet.</p></div>
