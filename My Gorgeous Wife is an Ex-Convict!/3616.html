        <h1>Chapter 3614</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stared at William for a while before asking, "So, when we were dining at Deer Capital last time, and you... gave them money, did you already know that they were your grandparents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," he admitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why did you pretend as if... they were just strangers?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because... I never felt like they were my family. If I had the choice, I would rather have no connection with them at all!" William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was taken aback, looking at the suppressed expression on his face, and murmured, "I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to apologize to me, it's not your fault," William said. "I don't know why they suddenly appeared in front of me again. They keep insisting that it's not about the money, but </span><span>they traveled all the way from Deer Capital to Emerald City! They even came to the school gate. Don't you find that ridiculous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe... they really missed you. You're their... only grandson..." Jasper speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only grandson?" William scoffed. "If they really cared about their only grandson, they wouldn't have disappeared when I had nowhere else to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper knew that William was once again reminded of the past. When his mother died, he was just a 5 or 6-year-old child with nowhere to go. The feeling of fear and helplessness, something that those who haven't truly experienced can never understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper unbuckled his seatbelt, turned to the side, and opened his arms to embrace William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know what to say at this moment, but she wanted to hold him like this, to comfort him, feeling that he seemed very sad... very sad...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head rested on her shoulder, his voice choked with emotion as he said, "Since they never appeared in the past, why should they show up after so many years? Do they think that after all these years, I would suddenly develop feelings for them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to see them, then don't see them in the future," Jasper said, not wanting to persuade him to forgive his grandparents or anything like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, as Mommy said, without experiencing the suffering of others, don't try to persuade others to be blindly kind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't experienced his pain, so she wouldn't advise him on anything. No matter what choices he made, she would stand behind him and support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's best not to see them," he slowly wrapped his arms around her, "They are no longer my family to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Jasper suddenly seemed to realize something, "Oh no, just now at the school gate, they said they were your grandparents, and there were quite a few people watching..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm afraid this matter will become campus gossip news later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, Jasper became frustrated, "If I had known, I wouldn't have stopped them back then! This wouldn't have caused a dispute! I thought they were suspicious at the time and thought they might harm you. Ai... look at me, I should have played it cool, and then let someone investigate afterwards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper regretted more and more as he thought about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay," William said. "Since they came all the way to Stanford University to find me, even if you didn't stop them or argue with them, I'm afraid the people at the school would still know about my relationship with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you going to do then?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't acknowledge them. After they realize that their actions are meaningless, they will naturally understand," William replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper couldn't help but feel a little uneasy. Can it really be that simple?</span></p></div>
