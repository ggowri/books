        <h1>Chapter 3610</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that you had your older brother hack the school forum," Jason spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper smiled awkwardly, "It happened suddenly, and I didn't think of any other way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What were you thinking about this matter?" Jason asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I wanted to catch the person who posted and give him a good beating! That person is so despicable. What does he want after all these years?" Jasper muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps it's aimed at William, or maybe he wants to sow discord between the Reed family and the Barlow family. There are many possibilities," Jason said, "What about you? Have you never harbored any thoughts of revenge against the Reed family or against you all these years, believing in William?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When saying this, Jason's gaze was fixed on his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe." Jasper answered without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if I don't believe?" Jason countered, "If I want you to stay away from William now, just in case. Even though he may not actually seek revenge on the Reed family, it's better to be safe, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper paused for a moment, then said seriously, "Dad, I won't distance myself from him. To me, there's no need to be cautious. If you're worried that my closeness to William will affect the Reed family in the future, or even bring them harm, I can assure you that I will never join Reed Group, I won't involve myself in any Reed family businesses, and I won't let my actions affect the Reed family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, on her delicate face, there was a touch of seriousness, and the aura she emitted surprised even Mick who was standing beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, don't scare our daughter!" After being married for many years, Grace naturally understood the meaning behind her husband's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason's eyes showed a hint of admiration, "This is my princess, the true princess of the Reed family, my daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper blinked, "Dad, Mom, what are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your dad just wanted to see how much you trust William. He's a child we've watched grow up, so how could we not know what kind of person he is?" Grace explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If William truly had revenge in his heart, they would have noticed it over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So all I can say is, that child is incredibly cunning, to the point where it's almost inhumanly scary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, you are my daughter, and the Reed family is your support. No matter what choices you make or what consequences they bring, the Reed family will be there for you," Jason said to his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, no matter what choices his daughter made, he would support her. He would never let her face things alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's eyes welled up, and she suddenly hugged her father tightly. "Daddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason thoroughly enjoyed his daughter's big embrace. "Alright, I'll also send a computer expert to help in finding the person who made the post."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad," Mick interjected, "I can find them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haven't you been searching for days and still haven't found them?" Jason bluntly retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because the person is cunning, but they won't be able to escape. I already have some leads," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, how many more days do you need?" Jason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In two days, I will be able to find out," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then two days it is. If you still can't figure out who the poster is after two days, I'll have Terrence handle it," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence was his personal secretary, and he would have Terrence mobilize the computer experts from Reed Group to take over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Mick agreed readily.</span></p></div>
