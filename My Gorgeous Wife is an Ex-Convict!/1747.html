        <h1>Chapter 1745</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily said, "Grace was pregnant with triplets, and one of the children isn&rsquo;t with them. I just happened to find out who that child is! If we kidnap the child, then we'll get the money for William's ransom. Besides, we'll be rich afterward and won&rsquo;t have to live like this anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean looked at Lily in shock, never expecting her to have such an idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kidnap? You're asking me to kidnap a child? Did it occur to you that we'll be sentenced for that? Since you know who their child is, tell them that information in exchange for one million dollars. I believe they'll pay you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Have you forgotten that I'm a fugitive wanted by the police? Even if they gave me one million dollars to save William, I would be put in jail if I showed up at their door! Sean, can you bear seeing William lose his mother at such a young age?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I..." Sean froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We can only use that child to save William! Besides, can you settle for a life of misery? Your mother and sister are both suffering. As long as we have money, we can go abroad and start all over again. Wouldn't that be great?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean was silent. If he had not trusted the wrong person and made the wrong investments, no matter how miserable the Stevens family was, they would not be in such a deplorable state now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had never even spent a day being a father to William!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, saving William meant he would have to do Grace wrong again! He had hurt Grace once before. Was he going to hurt her again this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know, I'll save William. It's just that... After kidnapping that child, you mustn't under any circumstances harm them," said Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A smile appeared at the corner of Lily's lips. "Of course. How could I hurt that child? I'm just trying to save William."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The child was not the one she wanted to hurt but Grace and Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wanted them to pay her back for all the suffering she had endured all these years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After being hospitalized for two days, Grace finally went home. The two children were happy to see her back after coming home from kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper jumped up and down in joy while Mick Reed sized Grace up before finally feeling relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, Brother took me to see Grandpa but there's no Grandma. Do you know where our grandma is?" Jasper asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her brother had told her not to ask their father about their grandma or he would get angry. If that was the case, it should be alright to ask their mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You saw Grandpa?" Grace was stunned for a moment. After asking her daughter, she learned that during the two days she was hospitalized, Mick Reed had brought Jasper to the mourning hall to pray in front of their grandfather's memorial tablet for her safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Jasper saw their grandfather's photo, she asked about their grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, she learned that Grandma was a taboo topic in the Reed family. Mick Reed had once asked about her when he was little, only to get a cold reply from Jason. "Never ask about your grandma. You don't have one, and that person doesn't exist in the Reed family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
