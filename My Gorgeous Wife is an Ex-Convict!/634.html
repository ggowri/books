        <h1>Chapter 633</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sipped one mouthful after another, allowing the feeling of lightness to surround her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason drank with her and poured more for her each time her glass became empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sometimes, I find fate funny, Jason," murmured Grace, swirling the wine in the glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You see, the evidence in my case all pointed at me back then, and I couldn't argue against it. During those three years in prison, I spent every day thinking about what the truth of the case was, about who wanted to frame me, and how much trouble it would take to get all these witnesses and evidence to point at me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed at herself as she said, "I even suspected everyone around me. I wondered who it could be and who would have such a grudge against me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words entered his ear one by one. They felt like a sledgehammer hitting his heart so hard that he felt his heart throb in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lifted her chin slightly toward him and said with a smile, "You know what, Jay? I never thought that... The person who wanted to frame me was not against me, nor was he against Jennifer Atkinson. He ruined my life by fearing some possible and perhaps even unnecessary liability!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three years in prison was like a lingering nightmare. It was the reason for her injuries all over her body, the reason that she lost her career and her future, and even the reason why she could never have children of her own!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, all this was just because someone was afraid of getting involved, so he used her as a scapegoat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such a simple but ridiculous reason turned out to be the answer that took her nearly four years to get!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason felt more pain in his heart. This was the first time he was feeling so regretful. He regretted turning a blind eye to her. He regretted letting her go to prison when he could have given her the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know that one day, he would fall in love with her and all the pain she had suffered would become his pain too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How he wished that pain was on him, not her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll get you the justice you want, Grace. Whatever you wish to happen to those who harmed you, I'll do it for you, so please stop feeling miserable, all right?" he said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"With you around, I won't feel miserable!" said Grace. She tilted her head back and drank the contents in her glass. "I should be happy today. After all, I finally have the answer to what I've been thinking about for the past three years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she wanted to pick up the half-empty bottle of red wine to pour herself another glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He put his hand on hers. "Stop drinking. Even if this wine has low alcohol content, you can get drunk if you drink too much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I do want to get drunk!" she smiled and said, "Just let me drink, Jay. Let me get drunk, please?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together. Then, after a moment, he removed his hand, picked up the bottle, and poured her a glass himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said with a smile, "You're so sweet, Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The wine ran down her throat through her red lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her comely face gradually showed a trace of flirtation because of her drunken state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was afraid that Grace would drink too much, so he ordered some food for her to eat in case the alcohol upset her stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you feed me?" she murmured, her almond-shaped eyes a little hazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, she was drunk. If she was sober, she might not have asked him so coquettishly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he welcomed this request with open arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason started feeding Grace at the bar. Cakes and steaks were cut into small pieces. If they were shellfish, they would be shelled for the meat.</p></div>
