        <h1>Chapter 4235 Does He Really Love Her?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's expression becomes somewhat stiff. The pen in his hand, which was signing documents, draws a long line on the paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?" he looks at her, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I say, how did our first time making love happen?" she asked, curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's expression seemed somewhat strange. "Why would you want to know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why wouldn't I want to know? After all, the first time making love is an important thing for anyone," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's face showed a conflicted expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Did our first time happen when I didn't want it to?" Tina speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Chandler quickly denied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it did happen when you didn't want it to?" Tina guessed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not that!" This time, the answer was slower than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Tina understood what was probably going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it really did happen when you didn't want it to?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, don't overthink it," he sighed, putting away the pen in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then tell me, how did it really happen?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was because I wasn't feeling well, and you wanted to help me, so we made love. For me, I didn't feel unwilling or unwilling, but I just felt that we shouldn't have rushed into it in that situation." He felt sorry for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could, if he could have restrained the pain at that time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of a physical reason?" Tina pondered, "Were you drugged at that time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These past two days, she watched a web series where the male lead was drugged and then made love to the female lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler pinched his nose. "It's really not like what you're thinking. It was because I wasn't feeling well, and I wasn't drugged or anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that the Hunter family curse had flared up, causing excruciating pain in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the only person who could make his body not hurt was her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you weren't feeling well, and I made love to you to help, why does it sound like I'm some kind of beast?" Tina grumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler listened to her increasingly outrageous words and frowned. "Tina, never speak of yourself like that. Do you know how grateful I am to you? How guilty do I feel towards you? Originally, you could have had more choices, but you were confined to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confusion flashed in Tina's eyes. "Why do I have trouble understanding what you're saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can fall in love with me again in the future, then you will understand," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pursed her lips. In other words, he would only explain the things she didn't understand, the things she couldn't understand after she fell in love with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I don't fall in love with you?" she asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly. "Then you don't need to understand the things I just said, right? If you don't fall in love with me and want to end this marriage, you can do so at any time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she truly couldn't love him, then he could set her free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed the choice in front of her with those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt a bit dazed for a moment, a wrenching feeling surging up once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why, even though she feels that this man should love her, and everyone around them says that he loves her, why can he so easily give up their marriage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does he truly love her, then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Tina suddenly has this doubt!</span></p></div>
