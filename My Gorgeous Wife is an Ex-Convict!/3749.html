        <h1>Chapter 3747</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, are you using the money you earned from selling yourself to support the little white face next to you? Does he know where the money for this meal came from?" Vanessa sarcastically said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Veronica heard this, she knew that Vanessa had misunderstood. The rumors circulating around the school had made Vanessa think that Veronica was able to come to this restaurant because she was being kept by someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And...does Mason look like a little white face?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica couldn't help but glance at Mason. Although his skin was fair and his appearance was delicate, has anyone ever dared to say that Mason was a little white face?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to say that she was keeping a little white face...oh my god!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vanessa, don't talk nonsense!" Veronica scolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to do it but not let others talk about it?" Vanessa sneered, "Does this little white face know that you're being kept by someone? Or does he think he's found a rich woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other party kept calling Mason a "little white face", leaving Veronica speechless. As Mason's face grew darker, Veronica could only silently mourn for Vanessa in her heart. If the other party was smart, they would leave immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I a little white face?" Mason's voice slowly rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa smiled and walked up, "Your outfit isn't cheap. Did Veronica buy it for you? She's been with a rich old man lately. If you're not a little white face, then what are you? Why don't you follow me? I can buy you designer clothes too. And of course, if I think you're good enough, maybe I'll make you my boyfriend for real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa spoke in a condescending tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's headache grew worse. She could almost imagine the expression on Vanessa's face when she found out Mason's true identity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, as the saying goes, "loose lips sink ships". This statement was really not unfounded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow you?" Mason's gaze stared straight at Vanessa. "What do you have that can make me follow you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other party's gaze made Vanessa inexplicably fearful. She felt like she was being watched by some terrifying presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this man had a beautiful face, when his eyes were fixed on someone, they exuded a strong pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pressure could even make people feel breathless, surpassing the pleasure brought by his handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa's group of girlfriends who were with her chimed in when Vanessa didn't speak. "Our Vanessa is a rich young lady. Have you heard of Katyna Corporation? That's her family's company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are over a thousand workers in her family's factory alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And in a few years, it might go public. By then, Vanessa's worth will be beyond what ordinary people can compare to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lucky to have caught Vanessa's eye. If you make her happy, you won't have to worry about anything in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason shrugged and turned to Veronica. "Is this your classmate? It seems like your school's admission standards are pretty low if someone like this can get in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was sweating profusely, "This has nothing to do with the threshold, every </span><span>school has such people."</span></p></div>
