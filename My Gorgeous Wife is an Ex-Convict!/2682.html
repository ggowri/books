        <h1>Chapter 2680</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without thinking much, Valda Theller knew she was being set up. 'Who did it? Queenie Mack?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack not only wanted her to be a stand-in for her, but she also wanted to make her more miserable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she felt the extras pulling off her costume. 'No, this can't go on!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller kicked one of the extras in the crotch as hard as she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man screamed, and Valda Theller took the opportunity to escape. However, she had only gotten up and taken about two steps forward when someone grabbed her hair and yanked her backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Ouch! It hurts!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was almost like her scalp was being ripped off!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face was full of pain, but out of the corners of her eyes, she caught sight of Raymond Bowman. He was only a few steps away from the director!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'There he is!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He asked me to wait for him while he went to tell the director to get me out of the scene, yet he's just standing there watching!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller fell to the floor as the extras tugged on her. They kicked her as if they were going to break all her bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Enough, enough! Stop them. They're really kicking Valda! They're not faking it!" Camille Strickland, who was standing on the other side not far away, noticed something was wrong and rushed to help her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was stopped by the other crew members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing? The director didn't even say cut! Besides, what does it matter? Sometimes, it's better if you don't fake it! We'll just tend to her wounds once it's over," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"F*ck you! Let go of me. We're not shooting a martial arts film! Who said they can do that?" Camille Strickland struggled to get away from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, another staff member came and held her down. She could only watch her best friend get repeatedly beaten. Even when her best friend tried to shout, they covered her mouth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These people did not even give Valda a chance to ask for help!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland hated herself for helping her best friend get her comic adapted into a TV show. Why did she become her best friend's burden? Valda would not have agreed to become a stand-in if it had not been for her! All this would not have happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland's pupils shrank suddenly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What are those people doing? They're trying to rip Valda's clothes off!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The script says they'll only pull up to the collarbone, but these guys are...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was frantic. She hated herself for being so useless. She could not even get to her best friend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was aching all over. She wanted to call for help and tell the people around her that they were not acting, but her mouth was covered so tightly that she could not spit out a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could feel them tugging on her clothes, and she tried her best to hold on to her dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been beaten up on campus before, but not like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought that was the worst time in her life, but this was even worse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who? Who can save me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or&hellip; do I have to wait for the director to yell out cut before anyone will see how hurt I am?'</p></div>
