        <h1>Chapter 108</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing the careful look on Jason's face as he carried the woman in his arms, everyone could tell that this woman was very important to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those who were aware of Jason's true identity secretly suppressed their thoughts when they saw this scene.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, he was a big shot in Emerald City. How could he appear in such a place in the early morning just for a woman? Moreover, he had made such a big scene.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Regardless of who she was, they were afraid that she would disrupt half of Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Find out who is involved in this matter, none of them should be left out," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes." One of his subordinates, who was walking beside him, answered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Jeremy and his wife looked down at their son, who was shouting with pain, and then they looked at the policemen in the yard. They wanted to cry but they had no tears to shed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The couple glared angrily at Grace's uncles. "Who the hell is she?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her uncle and second uncle also looked pale. They looked at each other in dismay. Was this niece of theirs not a helpless woman who had just been released from prison for less than half a year?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Otherwise, they would not have tried to take advantage of her!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now... obviously, there was a big shot backing their niece! Before that... When they thought of what they had said at the dinner and the fact that they had drugged their niece, they instantly broke out into a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why hadn't Grace admitted that she knew some big shots! If she had told them, they would not have done such a thing!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt her body becoming more and more uncomfortable and feeling as if she wanted something out of instinct, but could not tell what it was. She could only rely on the people around her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That familiar aura made her feel at ease, and then... she wanted more...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason looked at the person who was moving around more and more in his arms, and his face became gloomy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Damn it, if he had come a little later, or if she hadn't called him, she would have been...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, we've already found something. The drug they fed Miss Cummins was a kind of pill that was secretly sold in a small local bar. I've already sent people to find out the ingredients of the drug," Terrence said, reporting the latest news to Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who gave her the drug?" Jason asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It was her relatives. We haven't asked who exactly. They're all trying to blame it on each other," Terrence said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's eyes turned colder. Being betrayed by her relatives must have been a devastating blow.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He felt that the person in his arms was moving more and more violently and seemed to be getting more anxious. He lowered his head and heard her vaguely cry, "Jay... Jay..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm here." Jason's originally cold gaze turned gentle in an instant. He lowered his head and comforted her with a gentle voice, "I'm here, sis, hang on for a while, it'll be over soon..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she acted as if she couldn't hear his words. She continued to move restlessly, her fingers scratching his body randomly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He raised his hand and tried to wipe back her sweat-soaked hair, but she suddenly opened her mouth and bit his finger.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed!" Seeing this, Terrence immediately shouted.</p></div>
