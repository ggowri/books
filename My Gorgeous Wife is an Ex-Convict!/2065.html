        <h1>Chapter 2063</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I won't lie!" She wrinkled her little nose. Looking at his smile, she suddenly thought he looked so good when he smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson looked at the man he should call &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had just gotten out of school when someone stopped him and took him to a car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What did you say to Mommy the last time you asked her to stay back alone?" asked Nelson Corbyn. He would not have gotten in the car to meet the man he hated were it not for this question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss silently looked at his biological son who was looking at him with hostility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I was talking to your mommy about you being bullied, of course," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn snapped. "Don't talk to Mommy about that. It's none of your business whether I'm being bullied!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Back when the man in front of him treated him badly, he had already told himself that he had no father but only a mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's none of my business?" Martin Weiss suddenly sneered. "You have half of my blood. Even if you deny it, you&rsquo;re my son. Besides, you're not even 18 years old yet. You're still little, yet you can't wait to cut ties with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn pressed his lips together tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss added, "Besides, if I hadn't arrived in time that day, do you think you could stand in front of me like this now? You might still be lying in the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A hint of embarrassment flashed through Nelson Corbyn's face, but his gaze was unyielding. "One day, I&rsquo;ll become stronger and not let anyone bully me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"One day?" Martin Weiss sneered. "When is that? Or will you continue to learn that unpractical martial arts you call taekwondo and continue getting beaten up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Taekwondo isn't unpractical martial arts!" retorted Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Then let's go and see just how 'strong' you are that you think you can protect yourself! I'll take you there if you want to see it. Otherwise, you can get down from the car now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn hesitated. He looked at the store not far away, which was now surrounded by many students coming out of the school. He knew his mother would be busiest right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Mommy probably won't notice if I go to check it out? I'll just come back quickly!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, Nelson Corbyn nodded and the car slowly moved away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss took Nelson Corbyn to a training center. The name of the so-called martial arts did not matter. It was only about real combat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn's eyes widened as he watched two men go through combat drills as if he had never seen it before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">These two people had no fancy skills or fixed moves. They were only simple moves, but each of them was so straightforward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn was so mesmerized until the smartwatch on his wrist rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn looked at it and immediately knew it was his mother calling. He quickly pressed answer, and Kyla's worried voice immediately sounded. "Nelson, where are you now? Why aren't you back yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm..." Before he could finish, Martin Weiss had already leaned over. His lips were close to the smartwatch on his son's wrist. "Nelson is with me."</p></div>
