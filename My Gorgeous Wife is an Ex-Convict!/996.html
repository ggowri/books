        <h1>Chapter 995</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He feared that one day, she would smile at Brian, hug him intimately, and do everything she did with him with Brian. 'Will she... even marry Brian and have his children?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not bear the thought that flashed across his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that once a person fell in love with someone, they could never stop loving them...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's phone alarm woke her up, and she realized she was now lying in bed instead of sitting in a chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Jason carry me to the bed? That seems to be the only possibility if I think about it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no sign of Jason in the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The pills I laid out for him yesterday have all disappeared from the bedside table. He probably took them afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;But the rest of the medicine is still in the box. He didn't take them with him. It&rsquo;s still on the bedside table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I wonder how his stomach ache is now,' Grace thought to herself. Then, she laughed. 'Why am I worrying about him? He has Emerald City's best doctors to treat him if he feels sick!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly washed up, changed her clothes, and went to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she arrived at the firm, her colleagues also arrived one by one. Many of them would look at Grace from time to time. Some even whispered to each other as they looked at her, obviously talking about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, one of her female colleagues who was usually a big gossiper, approached her to ask curiously, "Grace, are you really dating Young Master Gu? Young Master Hart waited for you downstairs when you got off work yesterday. We're so envious of you. Many top female celebrities can&rsquo;t even get the same treatment!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the colleague with a dull gaze. The exaggerated admiration on her face and the words of flattery uttered were just to find out if she was dating Brian or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Grace's silence, she was about to ask more questions when suddenly, there was a cry of surprise from other colleagues nearby. "Hey, Andrea Schwartz. What happened to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz hobbled into the firm with a few bruises on her face. It looked like she had been&hellip; abused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... Nothing. I just tripped yesterday," Andrea Schwartz said with a look of embarrassment on her face. She glanced over to Grace as she spoke, her eyes full of resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was somewhat puzzled. 'Speaking of which, Andrea Schwartz and I don&rsquo;t have any bad blood, but Andrea Schwartz seems to be giving me trouble all the time. Is it because I took the spotlight when I first joined our previous firm?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, what were you guys talking about?" Andrea Schwartz managed to suppress the resentment in her eyes and put on her usual demeanor as if she was on good terms with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You took the day off yesterday afternoon and left early, so you don&rsquo;t know that when we got off work, the crown prince of the entertainment industry was waiting for Grace downstairs. He eventually left with Grace. I was asking Grace if she's dating Young Master Gu!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Andrea Schwartz immediately became jealous. What she went through yesterday was a far cry from what Grace went through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she seemed to say with concern, "Hey, I read online that Young Master Gu's girlfriend seems to be a woman named Stella! I think she wants to join show business, so Young Master Hart gave her lots of resources and found her a top manager. Grace, you know that, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Andrea Schwartz's &lsquo;concerned&rsquo; expression with a cold gaze and said, "I know. So what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just afraid that you&rsquo;ll inadvertently become a homewrecker. After all, netizens can be brutal! Look, Young Master Hart is aggressively making Stella famous. Rumor has it that Young Master Hart will get her the Best Actress award if Stella wants to win it," said Andrea Schwartz.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I read online that Stella is just a girl from the countryside, and she isn't that good-looking. The media even exposed that she's a divorcee. Surely Young Master Hart can do better than that!" said the gossipy colleague nearby.</p></div>
