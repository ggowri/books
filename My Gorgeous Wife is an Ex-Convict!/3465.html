        <h1>Chapter 3463</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Daniel, my offer is the best choice for both of us," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel suddenly felt a chilling sensation throughout his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The best choice?...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This person in front of him was three years younger than him, but at this moment, he felt like he was being manipulated by the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if he was just a puppet on a string, and no matter how unwilling he was, he had to do what the other person wanted him to do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family, a wealthy family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Daniel suddenly had a very clear understanding!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was well known in the class that Veronica and Daniel were dating, but on this day, someone suddenly posted a photo of Daniel being intimate with another girl in the class group chat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the photo, Daniel is embracing a young woman in a close and intimate manner. The classmate who posted the photo in the class group chat mentioned that it was sent to him by a friend who saw it on Daniel's social media account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on? Isn't Daniel Veronica's boyfriend?" someone asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Veronica, is Daniel cheating on both of them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is too much!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at the photo with a confused mind. After a moment, she called Daniel and asked, "Where are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Outside," said Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can we meet in person? I... I have some things I want to ask you," she said. At this moment, there were too many doubts filling her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Daniel responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica and Daniel met, Veronica showed him the photo from the class group chat and asked, "What's going on here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was direct and straightforward, without any probing, just wanting to find out the reason in the most straightforward way possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want any misunderstandings due to speculation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, I didn't expect you to find out," Daniel said nonchalantly. "Actually, I've been thinking about how to break up with you these days. Since you've seen it now, let's break up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Break up?" Veronica was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, break up," he said firmly. "I thought I loved you, but until I met Kay, um, the girl in the photo, I realized that I was in love with her at first sight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Love at first sight?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned, and a wave of pain came from her heart. It turned out that breaking up could be said so easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He fell in love with someone else at first sight, but what about her? What was she to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just... because you like her, is there no other reason?" She finally managed to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," the simple word shattered her last hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica couldn't even remember how she left. All she remembered was his cold expression and her own words, "Okay, I understand, let's break up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a year of dating, it ended like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt like crying, but she couldn't seem to shed any tears. She walked alone on the street, watching the passersby in groups of two or three, suddenly overwhelmed with an intense feeling of loneliness.</p></div>
