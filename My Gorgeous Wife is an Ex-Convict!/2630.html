        <h1>Chapter 2628</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she finally drew the last stroke, she let out a long sigh of relief. Her expression returned to normal. "Done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is dating me boring?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She froze. Then, she seemed to realize something and hurriedly said, "No, I didn&rsquo;t draw you because it was boring. The image of you reading just now was so beautiful that I couldn't help&hellip; uhh... drawing it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, her expression changed suddenly. "By the way, do you mind if I draw you like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's nothing to mind. I promised you we would date and you could draw me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller breathed a sigh of relief when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the two left the comic cafe, Brian sent Valda Theller back to her apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Next time, I'll pick you up on the weekend," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you come to my studio next time? There's no one at my studio during the weekends. I want you to model for me," said Valda Theller. Though she had drawn him today, she did not find it enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Okay, we'll do it at your studio. Do you have any dress code I need to comply with to model for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, no, you can wear whatever you want," she said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright." Brian drove away. Valda Theller turned around to walk into her apartment. However, she had only taken a few steps when a hand suddenly grabbed her arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked and turned her head to see Raymond Bowman, who had walked over to her at some point and was holding her arm tightly with one hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, what are you doing?" She struggled to break her away from his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his five fingers grabbed her like steel bars. "Is the man who just sent you back really your boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He came to her place to look for her today, but she was not at home. Therefore, he waited in his car in the apartment compound, only to find that the man he had seen in the restaurant before this sending her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think I introduced him to you last time. That man is my boyfriend," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Impossible!" Raymond Bowman said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller sneered. "How is it impossible? Does a boring woman like me doesn't deserve a boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's face turned pale. Boring... was what he had used to describe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With everyone watching, he said, "Valda Theller, I've never met such a boring woman like you. I hope you'll stop bugging me. I've told you many times that I don't love you. I'll only hate you more if you keep following me around and disgusting me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You still hate me for what I did to you, don't you?" Raymond Bowman asked as his lips trembled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the person in front of her coldly. "I did hate you back then. But I don't hate you anymore. After all these years, there's no point in hating someone irrelevant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Irrelevant?" Her words made him paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else could it be? Am I supposed to think of you as important?" she asked as if she was amused.</p></div>
