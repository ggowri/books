        <h1>Chapter 2651</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well? Is it good?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded. She had drunk cocktails before, but they were all made by bartenders from small bars. The glass today felt different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I feel like I've been drinking bad cocktails before this," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you like it, you can order more later," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can I order yours later?" she asked. The cocktail he was drinking looked beautiful and delicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mine?" Brian raised his eyebrows slightly. "My drink is a little strong. I'm worried it's too strong for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"'I'm a pretty good drinker," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Okay, then," said Brian as he called the waiter over and ordered another cocktail just like his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They drank and chatted. Perhaps because she had alcohol, Valda Theller was slightly more open than usual. The topics of their conversation became more casual too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang out beside them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about you buy me a drink?" The coquettish voice was suggestive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked up to see a woman in a tight dress and heavy makeup. She pulled out the chair next to Brian and sat down seductively. It was obvious that the woman had said that to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller blinked and looked at Brian. 'Do they know each other?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what Brian said next dispelled her confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not interested in buying strangers drinks." The indifferent tone was as estranged as usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll buy you a drink, then." The woman smiled seductively. "I'm much better than this woman. Why drink with someone like her? Be with me. I'll make you happy..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman said as she lifted her fingers with a black manicure and reached for Brian's hand that was holding the glass...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took a few seconds for Valda Theller to realize that the woman was referring to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm not that bad, am I?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Also, is this woman trying to seduce Brian? I think a girlfriend should fight back when someone's trying to seduce her boyfriend.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian had smashed the glass he was holding on the back of the woman's hand before Valda Theller could do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" The woman let out a wail of pain that was soon drowned out by the loud music in the bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have no interest in letting a woman like you touch me. F*ck off if you're smart. Or you're gonna leave both your hands here today," Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The icy tone and solemnness in those phoenix eyes made the woman break into a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know I am? If you touch me, you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do I need to know who you are? No one can save you if I really want to cut off your hands!" As he spoke, he pressed the glass harder, and the woman gave another painful wail. She stopped being stubborn and quickly got up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'll go now!" the woman pleaded with a face full of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian loosened the glass, and the woman quickly withdrew her hand and left.</p></div>
