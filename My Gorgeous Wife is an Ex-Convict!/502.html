        <h1>Chapter 501</h1>
        <div><p>Everyone at the design firm thought it was true. After all, Taylor Carline was quite a catch while Lina Sweeney was just a nobody at the design firm. She came from an ordinary family background and had ordinary looks as well. It was quite normal for her to be interested in a man like Taylor Carline.</p><p>After what happened yesterday, many colleagues were on Hattie Robson&#x27;s side.</p><p>Many felt that even though Hattie Robson and Taylor Carline were keeping their relationship low-key without anyone knowing, Lina Sweeney should not try to steal him away.</p><p>However, who would have thought Lina Sweeney&#x27;s boyfriend would be Hadwin Stephenson, the president of Stephenson Group!</p><p>If they compared Hadwin Stephenson and Taylor Carline, were the results not obvious? Hadwin Stephenson won in every way!</p><p>If Lina Sweeney had a boyfriend like Hadwin Stephenson and still seduced Taylor Carline... That was impossible, no?</p><p>Immediately, many colleagues who had been partial to Hattie Robson and Taylor Carline changed the way they looked at them and began to wonder if things were not necessarily as what Hattie Robson said.</p><p>Hattie Robson&#x27;s mind was almost blank. She thought it was all so unimaginably queer. After a while, she finally regained her speaking abilities. &quot;You mean... Lina Sweeney is your girlfriend?&quot;</p><p>She asked what was on everyone&#x27;s mind, though the answer was almost certain.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s right.&quot; Hadwin Stephenson smiled. Then, he stood up, and step by step, he walked toward Lina Sweeney under everyone&#x27;s eyes. He stopped when he reached Lina Sweeney. &quot;Lina, why don&#x27;t you point out to me the colleague named Taylor Carline? The one who caused the argument between you and your colleague yesterday? I would like to see if that person is really better than me, so much so that even your colleagues have misunderstood you.&quot; </p><p>Hadwin Stephenson clearly said that from the standpoint that Lina Sweeney was wronged.</p><p>Lina Sweeney stared at him blankly. She never expected to have their relationship exposed in front of her colleagues like this. &quot;Why are you here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;To invest in your project. Didn&#x27;t you say you might have some funding problems with your recent project?&quot; answered Hadwin Stephenson. His gentle tone was that of a most considerate lover.</p><p>All of a sudden, many women in the meeting room looked at Lina Sweeney in envy. Having your boyfriend invest in the project you were involved in that was underfunded… How many women could have such things happen to them?</p><p>The director of the branch company looked at Lina Sweeney in surprise. He had just taken over the branch company not long ago. The former director was unexpectedly laid off, so he took over.</p><p>He originally thought that was all. Hattie Robson was probably the one with the greatest background, but who knew the one with a great background was Lina Sweeney who usually went unnoticed.</p><p>Lina Sweeney did not know what she was going to say right now. She did say that her project was underfunded and the project might be canceled, but she had just talked about it casually to Hadwin Stephenson and never expected him to invest in it.</p><p>&quot;By the way, who is this Taylor Carline people are saying you’ve fallen in love with?&quot; Hadwin Stephenson asked again.</p><p>Hattie Robson and Taylor Carline&#x27;s faces immediately paled.</p><p>Taylor Carline quickly stood up and said, &quot;It&#x27;s a misunderstanding. It&#x27;s all just a misunderstanding! It has nothing to do with Lina Sweeney. My girlfriend misunderstood.&quot;</p><p>By saying so, Taylor Carline blamed it all on Hattie Robson. Hattie Robson felt wronged, but she could not throw a tantrum in public.</p></div>
