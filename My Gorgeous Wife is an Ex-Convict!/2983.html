        <h1>Chapter 2981</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the woman in his arms and couldn't help but feel a bit amused. She raised her hand and rubbed her head, "What are you thinking? No one is going to detain us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She looked at him in surprise, "We don't need to be detained?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right, we don't. We were just acting in self-defense," he explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But...what about their injuries...are they okay? Will they be disabled or anything? Will you get into trouble?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I held back, otherwise they might really have been disabled. Now they just need to lie in the hospital for a few days. But once they're better, they'll still be detained," Brian said, taking Valda's hand and saying, "Alright, let's go back first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked out of the police station in a daze, holding his hand, and didn't react until they got in the car. "Can we really go back?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not?" he asked with a smile, "Alright, buckle up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh." Valda finally fastened her seatbelt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove towards the villa, and Valda looked at Brian, "Are you hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do I look like I'm hurt?" he asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But didn't you injure your waist and abdomen before? During the fight just now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, that injury has almost healed and the fight didn't really affect it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Still, let's go to the hospital just to be sure," she said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced at her concerned expression and said, "Alright, let's go to the hospital then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he turned the steering wheel and drove towards the nearby hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since it was late at night, they could only go to the emergency room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a preliminary examination, the doctor confirmed that Brian was fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda breathed a sigh of relief, but then Brian took her to the nurse to have her checked and treated for the scratches and bruises on her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda finally realized that he had driven to the hospital to check on her injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Other than a few scratches on her neck and bruises on her arms, she was fine and the doctor prescribed some ointment for the bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Afterwards, if there is any danger, remember to call me," Brian said to Valda after they left the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I immediately thought of calling the police, but I didn't expect that woman to call first. However, she didn't gain any advantage. I also have some fighting skills. When I was in college, I taught myself how to fight. If it's one-on-one and the other person isn't a professional, I still have some confidence." She said this to reassure him and ease his worries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But his face became even more gloomy instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She became a self-taught expert because she experienced too much bullying in college. The more he learns about her past, the more he feels sorry for this woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Despite living in darkness for all those days, Grace still lives her life with such positivity and hope for the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In the future, with me around, you won't need to fight anymore!" Brian hugged Valda tightly. "You don't need to become a self-taught master, just live the life you want to live."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda buried her head in Brian's arms, feeling his embrace...so warm, so warm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, while Valda was busy in her studio, she received a phone call from Camille. "Valda, did you and Brian go to the police station yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, how did you know?" Valda asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I saw a photo of you and Brian sitting outside the crawfish restaurant we went to on the internet, and also a photo of you fighting and getting into a police car," Camille said.</p></div>
