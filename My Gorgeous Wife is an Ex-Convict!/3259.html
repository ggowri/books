        <h1>Chapter 3257</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Lina was chatting about entertainment gossip, "By the way, have you noticed the newly rising popular actor Kering recently? He has good acting skills, good looks, and seems to have a cute personality. Next time he's filming at the film and television city, I plan to go and see him. Do you want to come with me? We can form a group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kering? He's only 22 years old, but the drama he's currently in is pretty good," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Which one? I'll go check it out," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Time's Gift, he's so handsome in it!" Lina praised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin heard this and rolled his eyes, but Lina didn't even notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda, on the other hand, became interested. "Let's go to the film and television city together next time and watch the live filming. It's quite interesting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, it would be great if you could come. We might even get a chance to get up close with the crew!" Lina said. After all, Valda is the prince of the entertainment industry, and all the major crews are eager to work with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina was still excited when suddenly she screamed, "Ah! Something's wrong with my cards..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they say, too much joy brings sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, this mistake was irreversible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Grace struggled to the end, it wouldn't make a difference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the game ended, Kyla and Valda breathed a sigh of relief, finally holding onto the last bit of clothing on their respective husbands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace and Lina looked a bit embarrassed as they glanced at their own husbands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace blinked and said to Jason, "I lost."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I saw," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...I'm willing to accept the punishment," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course," Jason said, raising his hand and slowly unbuttoning his shirt. "Since you lost, I'm your bet, so I have to accept the punishment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No way! Is he really going to take it off?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda widened her eyes in surprise. After all, this was Jason's last piece of clothing. If he really took it off, then...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda didn't even have time to react before Brian covered her eyes with his hand. In the next moment, Brian grabbed his own clothes and lifted Valda up like a child. "Let's go for now, we'll meet again next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing speaking, he quickly hugged Valda and left the private room. It seemed like if they stayed any longer, his wife would be as angry as a hornet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla and Martin exchanged a smile. "Well then, if that's the case, we'll be on our way," said Martin. He put on the clothes he had just taken off and left the private room with Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, in the private room, only the losing team remained, looking at each other in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin pulled his wife close to him and said, "Alright, since everyone has left, let's go back home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, you haven't even agreed to the bet yet. Look at Jason, he has so much to offer! At least follow the rules!" Lina shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm willing to bet and accept the consequences!" Hadwin quickly put on his clothes and lifted his wife onto his shoulders. "When we get back, I'll follow the rules. Whatever you want me to take off, I'll take off!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... um, can you stop for a moment? Let's walk later, why rush like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who else do you want to stay and watch?!" Hadwin said impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the sound of the opening and closing door faded away, only Grace and Jason were left in the private room.</p></div>
