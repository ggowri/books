        <h1>Chapter 1939</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would drink coffee from the matching mug she bought, lean on the matching pillow as he read on the couch, and wear the fuzzy Mickey slippers while she wore her Minnie slippers. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At the time, she even joked about taking their children to Disneyland when they got pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," Hadwin Stephenson said without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's face paled as she bit her lip slightly. Moments later, she seemed to have cheered up again and said, "It's okay. I'll buy some more when I get a chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson seemed to fly into a rage. "What on earth do you want? I thought we made it clear yesterday. You can talk to my secretary if you want money. If you don't, leave J City and return to Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Don't show up in front of me anymore. You'll only upset me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina stretched out her hand and cautiously tugged at Hadwin Stephenson's sleeve. "Hadwin, are you sure you can't forgive me? I... I didn't know that you had a blood curse on you, and I didn't know that you knelt and kowtowed to beg Katherine Jackson for me. I... I thought you were dating Katherine Jackson to get Stephenson Group. I had no idea you did all that to save me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was filled with guilt when she said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had done so much for her, but she knew nothing about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes glimmered a little. He heard her say, "When I didn't know anything, I did think about getting rid of the baby. I wanted nothing to do with you because I was afraid that I would think of you whenever I saw the child. Then I wouldn't be able to stop loving you, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She paused as her round eyes stared at him. "I still couldn't bear to abort the baby after you left that day. When I lay on the operating table and heard the doctor asking me whether I was sure I wanted to proceed with the surgery, I shouted no. No, because this is our baby. We agreed to give birth to the baby if I ever got pregnant..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She still felt a pang of fear at the thought of how close she was to losing the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's dark eyes met Lina's eyes. The darkness in his eyes made it hard to decipher what was on his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina timidly raised her hand and slowly reached for Hadwin Stephenson's cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes narrowed, but he did not avoid it. Her hand pressed his cheek gently as she had wanted. "Has it finally stopped hurting whenever I touch you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes grew darker. "So what? If you hadn't disappointed me, I wouldn't have let you go no matter how much pain I was in. But I'm utterly disheartened now. Even if I&rsquo;m no longer in pain when you touch me, it's pointless to me now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's not pointless!" Lina could not help but hug Hadwin Stephenson hard. "Katherine Jackson told me how painful it is to get rid of the blood curse. The pain felt like you were being deboned, and you had to suffer through it more than once. Every time you underwent the session, it hurt more than the last but you endured it for me, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I endured all that for you. I was even prepared to lose my life. I only thought I would go to you and promise you a lifetime of happiness if I survived. If I died, my fortune would be set up into a fund for you and the baby. You&rsquo;d never have to worry about money for the rest of your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina felt a pang in her heart when she heard that. 'So that's the truth...' He told her nothing but had already made plans.</p></div>
