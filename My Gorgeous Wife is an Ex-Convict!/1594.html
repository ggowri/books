        <h1>Chapter 1592</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It only hurt for a little while. I... had already walked out of the bedroom, so I didn't wake you. I talked to the doctor this morning. There's not much of a problem. Besides, I haven't finished my medicine," he said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, Grace still looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, my injuries are no big deal. They don't matter," he said as hesitation flitted through his eyes. "Do you have no memories of why you left me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace nodded. "Yeah." It was true. She was only lacking the memories of when she fell into the sea and&hellip; After the fall, she woke up in the hospital and became another &lsquo;Grace&rsquo;, which she also did not remember.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She also wanted to recover all her memories because she wanted to know what happened after falling into the sea. 'Why was I rescued, and why was only Jasper with me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Where on earth is the third triplet? Are they dead or alive?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace raised her hand and gently touched Jason's injured lips. "The headache must have been painful yesterday," she muttered. Otherwise, with his self-control, he would not have left such wounds on his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's alright. The pain is gone now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you ever have a headache again, wake me up even if I'm asleep. Don't keep me in the dark." She did not want him to suffer while she slept peacefully, unaware of his pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, I know there's nothing I can do about your headache, but we're husband and wife. Since we made a vow when we got our marriage license that we'll take care of each other when we're sick, there's no reason that you should hide your suffering from me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes gazed at the person in front of him. The image of her bending over the sink while constantly throwing up with a pale face flashed through his mind. He could not even get close to her at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He and she could now be so close!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;Did she leave me because she hated me? Did she leave me because she couldn't accept my advances?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her memories had not fully recovered either. She also had no idea why she left him, so she could say without hesitation that it was not because she did not love him that she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What if she restores her memories one day? Will she still be able to say the same?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, we're husband and wife!" he muttered and hugged her hard. "We're husband and wife. We made a vow, so... you can never abandon me again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could not accept that outcome no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What? You're... not coming? But you agreed to come over for a livestream last time... Hey, Miss Wan. Miss Wan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how much Irene Lynch shouted, the person on the other end of the line had hung up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch slammed her phone on her desk with a grim look on her face. The person surnamed Wan was the daughter of a jeweler in Emerald City. She was more or less a socialite, and her boyfriend was in the entertainment industry, so Miss Wan was considered to have one leg in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch remembered how much Miss Wan used to suck up to her. She had always been more than happy to help her as long as she asked her!</p></div>
