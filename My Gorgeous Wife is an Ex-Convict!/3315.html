        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he entered the room, Brian spoke up, "Okay, can we talk now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda suddenly reached out and wrapped her arms around Brian's waist, burying her face in his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Her appearance suddenly made him nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"While watching the New Year Gala just now, I suddenly had an urge to cry," she said. However, she didn't want her in-laws and godmother to see her cry, fearing they might misunderstand, so she made an excuse to go upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He paused for a moment, then lifted her face and asked, "Are you thinking about your parents?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, it's more than that," she sniffled and said, "When I was a child, during the New Year, my parents and I always watched the New Year Gala together. Later, when I was at my uncle's house, their TV was in the master bedroom, so when we watched the New Year Gala, they would all be lying on the bed. At that time, I would sit far away on a small stool to watch, but I wasn't really happy. Later...I became independent and lived alone, so I watched the New Year Gala alone. Today, seeing all of you watching it with me, I suddenly felt like I wasn't so lonely anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, her eyes becoming even more moist, "Brian, it's so wonderful that I can marry you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lowered his head and gently kissed the corner of her eye. "Okay, don't cry. From now on, you won't watch the New Year Gala alone. We will all be with you, and in the future, our children will also be there to watch it with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I won't cry, won't cry. It's such a happy day, I won't cry," said Valda, trying hard to hold back her tears and prevent them from falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian said, "After you give birth and recover, we will go visit your parents again and tell them the good news that our child is safe and healthy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian gently embraced Valda and said, "Let's stay upstairs for a while until you feel better, and then we can go back down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the two finally came downstairs, it was already half an hour later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them went downstairs and the old Mrs. Hart said, "What are you carrying for so long? You missed the exciting show just now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face turned slightly red and she looked a bit embarrassed. After all, that was just an excuse and she didn't actually take anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, Mom, go ahead and continue watching the program," Brian interrupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Hart, who was elderly, looked at the two individuals and didn't say anything further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was just yawning and wanting to sleep when Brian accompanied her upstairs. However, the old Mrs. Hart came over and asked Brian to come out for a few words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian walked outside the room and asked, "Mom, is there anything you want to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Hart, the elderly woman, gave her son a stern look and asked, "Tell me honestly, did you spend over half an hour upstairs with Valda because you couldn't resist?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Couldn't resist?" Brian was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Old Mrs. Hart appeared to be deeply concerned and said, "Although I know that you and Valda have a good relationship and you love her very much, Valda is now pregnant with such a big belly. No matter how unbearable it is, you have to endure it. It's already the last moment. If something unexpected happens, I wonder how much you will regret it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian finally understood what his mother was referring to and couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time. He said, "Mom, it's not what you think it is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, then tell me, what is it like?" asked the old Mrs. Hart.</p></div>
