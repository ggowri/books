        <h1>Chapter 4005</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason suddenly hugged Grace tightly and said firmly in her ear, "Don't be afraid, nothing will happen like it did back then, no one will be in danger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Grace asked in a trembling voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm." A very light response, but it made Grace's frightened heart calm down a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, Mick, it's your turn to choose, do you choose your sister or this woman who once betrayed you?" Irene gave the choice to Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone's eyes turned to Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt a sense of desolation in her heart, the answer was obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not only for Mick, but also for the Reed family, Jasper's importance was far greater than hers, so choosing Jasper was only natural.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Irene, you promised not to harm them both!" The usually calm peach blossom eyes were now filled with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I promised not to harm your most important person," Irene boasted about her wordplay game, "besides, it's your decision to make. The person you give up hurts, not me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Irene spoke, she glanced at Nancy again. "What do you think, Nancy? Why don't you try the taste I once had? Experience the feeling of being abandoned and falling into despair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Irene, you're crazy! Nancy has nothing to do with you, and even my brother and her are over. Why do you want to harm her? Even if she dies, it won't benefit you, will it?" Jasper shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if there's no benefit, it doesn't matter. I just want to see what the Reed family will choose. Will they save their own family or a traitor?" Irene giggled, "Oh, by the way, they say the Reed family is selfish, but Barrister Grace sacrificed herself to save Mr. Reed by crashing her car off a cliff."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene's gaze turned to Jasper. "You're Barrister Grace's daughter, and everyone says you're kind. I wonder if you have the courage to sacrifice yourself? If you jump off the cliff, won't Nancy be saved?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Irene seemed to be desperately trying to reveal the ugliness of human nature, constantly fanning the flames!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No! Jasper, you can't do that!" William, who had been silent all along, suddenly shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face was devoid of color, and his expression was full of fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was afraid that her kindness would really make her choose as Irene had incited!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was selfish!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He would naturally choose to let Nancy die rather than let Jasper suffer any harm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't do this. If you jump, I'll jump with you!" William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was stunned. She knew that he wasn't joking with that statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her heart almost stopped beating when she heard his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She is even more afraid than if she were to be killed herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she were to die, she absolutely does not want William to die with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No...if I really..." Jasper choked up, unable to continue, "You absolutely cannot jump down with me! William, do you hear me? You listen carefully!"</p></div>
