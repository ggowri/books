        <h1>Chapter 1819</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney walked up to his daughter, patted her on the shoulder, and said, "You don't have to worry about your mother and me. If you want to have the baby, then have it. The baby is a member of the Sweeney family. Don't worry about those rumors. If too many people are gossiping about us, we'll just move. What's there to be afraid of?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, Lina. You don't have to worry about anything other than whether you want to have this baby and whether you want to be with... Hadwin Stephenson," Mrs. Sweeney also came forward and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew her daughter still had feelings for Hadwin Stephenson, but she understood her concerns as well. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After hearing what her parents said, Lina suddenly hugged them and burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her worries, loss, frustrations, and pent-up emotions came bursting out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her parents would always stay by her side and have her back no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After crying her eyes out, Lina felt a lot better. Perhaps it was because she had been too afraid of how her parents would react when they found out she was pregnant. She had wondered countless times if they would criticize her, be angry, or be disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now, her parents' reaction reassured her. She could come to a decision without any worries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had to think about whether she was keeping the child in her belly and what she was going to do with Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she did not want to keep the baby, then the earlier she undergo abortion, the less damage it would cause her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... if she did not keep this child, would she have another one in the future? For some reason, Lina seemed to have an inkling that maybe this child was the only child she would have in her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Also, what does Hadwin Stephenson mean by a week? Give him a week? Can all the troubles between us be gone after a week?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Will we be happy together?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina could not help laughing bitterly at this though.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She continued working in the design office for the next few days, but her morning sickness from time to time still stirred up rumors in the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As a result, the director called her into his office and asked, "Lina, there are rumors about you being pregnant. I don't want to pry into your private affairs, but there's a project I was going to ask you to take charge of. After all, you've been here for so many years. But if you're pregnant, you won&rsquo;t be able to follow up with the project and will only slow down progress.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze, suddenly understanding which project the director was talking about. It was a good project the design office had taken up recently. If she took charge of it, it would be something good to put on her resume.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Think about it and let me know in a week whether you think you can take on this project," the director said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, got it," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew the director was hinting at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she wanted to keep the child, she would have to reject taking the project. If she did not want the baby, she could take on the project and bring her career to the next level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Choosing between career and the baby?' Lina gave a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina asked Grace out in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're not asking me to drink with you again, are you? You can't drink now that you're pregnant," quipped Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll drink plain water!" said Lina.</p></div>
