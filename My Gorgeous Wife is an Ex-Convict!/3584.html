        <h1>Chapter 3582</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She donated a butterfly-shaped hair clip, adorned with various precious gems, making it exquisite and beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This hair accessory has a starting bid of 300,000 US dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William furrowed his brows slightly. "Don't you like this hair clip?" He remembered that this was a gift from Uncle Reed when she graduated from middle school, and she loved it at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I do like it, but I want to do something more meaningful with something I love," Jasper said. "To me, it's just a hair clip, but for some people, it can provide them with food and clothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was a little surprised. He always felt her kindness unintentionally, just like when she chose music therapy as her future direction of study instead of pursuing piano as everyone had guessed before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then how about I bid on it? Consider it my contribution to charity," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, you've already contributed to charity by bidding on the sheet music earlier. Let someone who truly likes this hair clip bid on it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as the auction began, many people started bidding on the hair clip. Of course, half of them were trying to please the Reed family and Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, if they could win Miss Reed's hair clip and use it to make friends with the Reed family, it would be a great thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the bidding reached 800,000, even Jasper was surprised. After all, this hair clip was not like the sheet music, which could be a genuine article. It was just an ordinary item, not a limited edition. Even if someone else wanted to buy the same one, they could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang out, "Two million!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This price had more than doubled, and the scene fell silent as the voice sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper turned to look at the middle-aged man who had just spoken. He had a strange appearance that Jasper had never seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know that person?" Jasper asked William beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know him. He's probably not a celebrity from Emerald City," William said. After all, he knew almost all of the wealthy and famous people in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked puzzled when she heard this. She wondered what the stranger's intention was in paying 2 million for her butterfly hair clip. Surely, a grown man wouldn't be so fond of a hair accessory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With no one else competing, the item was sold for 2 million after the auctioneer called out three times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the charity auction ended, Jasper found out that the buyer had wired the 2 million directly to the organizers and took the hair clip with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why would someone spend so much money on a hair clip?" Jasper murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If that person has a real motive, we'll find out soon enough," William said, rubbing her head. "Don't overthink it. Stay flexible. Thinking too much will exhaust your brain cells."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper smiled, "That's right."</p></div>
