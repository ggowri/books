        <h1>Chapter 3204</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And William, he's probably just naive and doesn't really understand what love is yet. He just sees Jasper as the most important person in his life, even to the point of having some puppy love tendencies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And in the future, no one can know how these two children will develop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't say William doesn't play well, but the feeling when they both play the piano is different!" Jasper said casually, still immersed in the piano music he had just heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Brian and Valda have arrived at this table to offer a toast. Grace then took a few children and together with Jason, they returned the toast to the newlyweds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The triplets followed the previous rehearsal and congratulated the newlyweds, making Valda giggle uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian and Valda, I wish you happiness!" Grace sincerely said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," Brian said, looking at Grace and understanding her gesture. Then he clinked glasses with Grace and they drank together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For so many years, I was obsessed and trapped in the mud of emotions, but in the end, I was saved by another person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He doesn't regret loving Grace. Without that love for Grace, he might have missed out on being with Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The relationship between him and Valda, one could say, was brought about by Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian and Valda finished their drinks at this table and moved on to the next one, Jason looked at Grace and said, "They will surely be very happy in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Brian really, really loves Valda," Grace murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the ending she most wants to see!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Valda fell into the water and couldn't be found for a year, she thought she would never see this scene again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Valda has returned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace and Jason sat back down, and Jasper leaned in close to Grace again. He continued with the previous question, "Mommy, can you help me find that boy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Which boy?" Jason asked with great interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Jasper repeated the incident of hearing the piano music in the hallway and the person running out of the storeroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason's eyes flickered with a hint of thoughtfulness, "So, does Jasper really want to find that boy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, I want to hear him play the piano again," the little one nodded vigorously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason looked at William standing next to Jasper and asked, "What about William? Do you want Jasper to find that boy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's body suddenly stiffened and met Jason's gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, he felt as though the other person had seen through all of his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every time he was looked at like this by Uncle Reed, he felt like he couldn't hide anything and felt a heavy sense of oppression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He certainly doesn't want Jasper to find that boy, nor does he want her to develop feelings for someone else's piano and then... develop feelings for that person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because... he used to be like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he didn't have a piano back then, maybe Jasper wouldn't have been so interested in him!</p></div>
