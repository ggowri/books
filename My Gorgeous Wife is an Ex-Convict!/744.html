        <h1>Chapter 743</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she was in dire need of help, the man said, "What I regret most in my life is that I chose you to be my girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How ridiculous! How ironic!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out vows of eternal love were unable to withstand the blow of an accident. It turned out the so-called &lsquo;the only one&rsquo; and &lsquo;decided&rsquo; were easily replaced by another woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The voice that was once familiar now sounded so strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned to look at Sean who was standing not far behind her. He was still clad in luxury brands and was fashionable, looking just like a charming young man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No wonder Lily chose to be with Sean. After all, he looked pretty good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think there's anything left between you and me for us to talk about," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just a few minutes. I just want to say a few words to you." Sean snapped. Then seemingly afraid of missing out on the opportunity, he added, "Grace, I know that I let you down with that incident. I didn't protect you because of the pressure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked coldly at him. "Sean, you don't have to tell me this. I'm not interested in listening."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A flash of embarrassment came over Sean's face. "I just want you to understand that the person who&rsquo;s really wrong for putting you in prison is Dexter Rios, not Lily. Lily is innocent. She just thought you're the one who killed her sister, so she treated you the way she did. You shouldn't hate her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only found Sean's remarks ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, it's Dexter Rios who put me in jail, but what did Lily do to me when I insisted I was wronged?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many people had suffered the pain of having ten fingernails pulled out and the bones of their fingers being broken inch by inch?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From what she gathered, many of the people who abused her in prison had received money from the Atkinson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the eyes of the Atkinson family, Jennifer Atkinson's life was a life, but was the life of others worth nothing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, she even wondered if the Atkinson family really did not suspect and investigate the false evidence Dexter Rios made when Dexter Rios went abroad after she was sentenced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, Lily is really innocent! You shouldn't have asked Jason to blacklist her in the entertainment industry for this. Besides, she has already apologized to you. What else do you want?" said Sean. The way he looked at Grace was as if he thought she was ignorant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What else do I want&hellip;' He asked as if she was ignorant, greedy, and unsatisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly had the urge to laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to have this look in his eyes whenever she had an opinion or a disagreement with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she was willing to play along with him because she had feelings for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now... He was nothing to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If she really meant it, why didn't she pull out her fingernails, break the bones of her fingers inch by inch, and beg for my forgiveness? Innocent? Who's the innocent one?" Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean's face grew grimmer. "Grace, I didn't expect you to turn out like this. You weren't so vicious before, you&ndash;"</p></div>
