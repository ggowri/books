        <h1>Chapter 3492</h1>
        <div><p> </p><p>&quot;At that time, I was still young!&quot; she defended.</p><p>&quot;Even if I see it, so what? I&#x27;ll just think it&#x27;s really cute!&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Do you really think my drooling while sleeping is cute?&quot; she asked in confusion.</p><p>&quot;Mmm, very cute.&quot; It was even cute enough to make him want to have her earlier!</p><p>Jasper&#x27;s face blushed again, for some reason she always seemed to blush in front of him tonight.</p><p>&quot;Are you going back to Deer Capital tomorrow?&quot; She changed the subject and asked.</p><p>&quot;My school gave me a few days off, so I&#x27;ll be here in Emerald City for a few days, at least to figure out what happened with this kidnapping case.&quot; William said, raising his hand and gently stroking the wound on Jasper&#x27;s wrist.</p><p>Her fair skin had many abrasions, which were caused by the kidnappers tying her hands with ropes and her struggling to break free.</p><p>Although the wounds had been treated with medicine, they still needed to scab over, which would take several more days.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a good thing nothing serious happened this time. Be more careful in the future, even with familiar people, don&#x27;t let your guard down.&quot; William reminded her.</p><p>&quot;I know!&quot; She replied. This incident was a lesson for her.</p><p>&quot;Does your injury still hurt?&quot; He asked.</p><p>&quot;It doesn&#x27;t hurt much anymore. My injuries are much lighter than Veronica&#x27;s, and she almost got caught by those kidnappers...&quot; Thinking of this, Jasper&#x27;s body trembled.</p><p>After she was rescued, she learned from her parents that Veronica had distracted the kidnappers and was caught by them, almost being raped. Fortunately, Mason appeared and saved Veronica from harm.</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid, everything is okay now.&quot; He quickly raised his hand and gently stroked her back to comfort her, as he watched her trembling body.</p><p>Jasper suddenly reached out and hugged William, burying his face in William&#x27;s arms.</p><p>&quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; he asked, instinctively embracing her with both arms. &quot;Are you that scared? After this, the Reed family will probably assign more people to protect you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When Veronica told me to hide and distract the kidnappers herself, I was really scared. I was afraid that something bad would happen to Veronica while I desperately ran down the mountain to find help and save her. I was afraid that Veronica would end up like Lawrence&#x27;s parents.&quot;</p><p>Jasper&#x27;s voice began to choke up.</p><p>When she uttered the name &quot;Lawrence,&quot; William&#x27;s body tensed up.</p><p>Even after so many years have passed, she still hasn&#x27;t forgotten Lawrence.</p><p>Once, he thought that with the passage of time, Lawrence would gradually fade away in her heart.</p><p>But now it seems that not only has it not been forgotten, but it has become even more profound.</p><p>The matter of Lawrence and the Abbott family is like a perpetual pain in her heart. Perhaps only finding Lawrence in the future can relieve her pain.</p><p>But...if we really do find Lawrence...</p><p>When this possibility crossed his mind, he suddenly felt afraid.</p><p>Once they find Lawrence, will their relationship remain the same as it is now? Will she belong to him in the future? Or if Lawrence reappears, will he lose her?</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly held her tighter in his arms.</p></div>
