        <h1>Chapter 3066</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once it is brought up, no one can say for sure what the outcome will be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once, a journalist mentioned Valda's name in front of Brian and asked if they had broken up. As a result, Brian physically attacked the journalist and sent them to the hospital. Since then, nobody has seen that journalist in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The uncontrollable and frenzied behavior of Brian when he hit the reporter, along with his aggressive appearance, left a lasting impression on those who witnessed the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, people gradually began to understand that the three letters "Valda" were synonymous with taboo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, the person most frequently seen with Brian is a woman named Camille. Many people are speculating in secret whether Camille is the prince's new lover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whenever Camille sees this kind of gossip online, she can only helplessly smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reason why Brian became close to her and even met her once a week is because they both share a bond over "Valda".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every week, Brian would ask her to talk about things related to Valda, whether it was their experiences in school or Valda's work experiences. Brian was desperate to know everything about Valda, even though this understanding now seems too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian goes to the apartment where Valda used to live every week to clean it himself, without relying on anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once, when Camille was also at Valda's apartment, she saw Brian holding one of Valda's sketchbooks and crying like a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later on, Camille found out that the booklet was filled with drawings of Brian, all done by Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even some of the paintings had Valda's personal messages next to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were things that Valda left for Brian, but for Brian now, they felt more like a punishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A punishment for his missed opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman who once loved him so much was gone! She couldn't be found!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It wasn't until now that Camille truly felt that Brian had really fallen in love with Valda! How happy Valda would have been if she knew?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But...it was too late!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once again, Camille arrived at Valda's apartment door and took out the key to the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, there were two keys to this apartment, one in her hand and the other in Brian's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And when she opened the door, the lights in the room were on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be that Brian had come?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille thought for a moment, then closed the door and walked through the hallway to the living room. There was no one in the living room, so she figured Brian must have gone to Valda's bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille thought about it but didn't go into the bedroom to disturb. Often, when she and Brian were both in the apartment, they wouldn't bother each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille sat on the sofa in the living room and picked up a Valda comic book, flipping through it casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whenever she stays here like this, looking at everything in the room remaining the same, she feels as if Valda is still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But with the amount of water released from the reservoir, there's no way Valda, who can't swim, could have survived!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, suddenly, there was a loud noise of something heavy falling to the ground in the bedroom, followed by a woman's cry of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille's body suddenly stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What is this sound...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost abruptly stood up and looked straight towards the direction of the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is it possible? Could it be Valda?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is Valda still alive? Did she even come back here?!</p></div>
