        <h1>Chapter 1026</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the way to the police station, Lina told Hadwin Stephenson what happened at the food stall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson could not help frowning. It seemed fortunate that Jason's two bodyguards were around. Otherwise, the three women could not have escaped!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I send two bodyguards to protect you as well?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina quickly refused. "No, I&rsquo;ll feel like I&rsquo;m being watched and feel uncomfortable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I promise I'll call you immediately if there's any real danger!" said Lina as she raises her hand in a swearing gesture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson found the way she looked both funny and annoying at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at the police station, Grace told the police what happened earlier and submitted the recording on her phone. The three thugs were also handed over to the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the police took their statements, Lina said to Grace, "Hadwin and I will send you back later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three of them walked out of the police station, and the two bodyguards followed Grace after giving their statements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson parked his car in a parking space in front of the police station. However, a black Bentley was currently parked in another parking space not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stopped in her tracks. 'That's... Jason's car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's here too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two bodyguards following Grace now stepped forward and said to Grace, "Miss Cummins, please step this way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips. 'That means the two bodyguards knew Jason would be here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's right. Jason sent them. Of course, they'll report to Jason whatever that happened.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, what's wrong?" Lina also stopped and looked strangely at her best friend who had stopped behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said awkwardly, "You guys go ahead. I'll... go back in a different car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina glanced at her best friend before glancing at the two bodyguards. Then, her eyes fell on the nearby Bentley. "Is that Jason? Is he in the car?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina stared at the car. "I'll ask him what he's doing with you." Although Lina felt grateful to the two bodyguards Jason sent, this was a different matter. &lsquo;Jason's brother and sister game is just silly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Since they&rsquo;ve broken up, isn't this just torture?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Lina was about to run over, Grace stopped her best friend. "This is between us. I'll take care of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew Lina was worried about her, but she was also afraid that Lina would make Jason mad by going against him. Even if Lina had Hadwin Stephenson to protect her, she might not be entirely safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Lina was still worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, you&rsquo;d better not cause her trouble," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina gave up and said to Grace before parting ways, "If Jason is giving you a hard time, you must tell me. We'll find a solution together."</p></div>
