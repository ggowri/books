        <h1>Chapter 1932</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson did not expect to see Lina, who was being stopped by his security guards, when he drove back to the Stephenson family's residence in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not expect her to come here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had also seen Hadwin Stephenson's car and wanted to stop it but the security guards held her back, preventing her from getting close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Another security guard rushed to Hadwin Stephenson's car. After the window was rolled down, he said, "Mr. Stephenson, this lady said she's your friend and wants to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I have no such friend. Make her leave!" As soon as Hadwin Stephenson said this, the car window rolled back up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's car drove into the Stephenson family's residence, and the security guard said to Lina, "Mr. Stephenson said he doesn&rsquo;t know you. I think you should just go home and stop daydreaming!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guard seemed to think of Lina as the kind of woman who wanted to approach Hadwin Stephenson to join a wealthy family. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina seemed embarrassed, but she did not back down. Instead, she took out a foldable stool she had with her, then a bottle of water and an insulated lunchbox from her bag. The food was prepared by Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina found a corner and began to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guard frowned and wanted to drive her away, but she was not within the perimeters of the residence. In other words, she was on a public road. They had no right to do anything to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After Lina finished eating, she carefully put the things away and threw the garbage in the nearby trash can. No one could find any fault with her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was also the first time the security guard had seen anyone take their dinner at a place like this. Looking at Lina, he advised her and said, "Don't wait here. Mr. Stephenson won't look at you even if you wait till dawn. If you can easily see Mr. Stephenson by waiting here, a group of people will soon be waiting here with their stools as well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After hearing that, Lina replied rather seriously, "I'll leave. I'll leave at nine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Huh?' The security guards froze again. They thought she would wait here forever and put on some sorrowful show since she had even brought a stool with her, but she was unexpectedly leaving at nine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're leaving at nine?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, I'm going home to sleep. Going to bed late is bad for my health,&rdquo; said Lina. After all, she had to take care of the baby in her belly, so she tried to eat and sleep well just so the baby could grow better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, what Lina did not know was that Hadwin Stephenson was in the Stephenson family's residence's security room. He was watching her through the surveillance video with an expressionless face and dark eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Time ticked by, and Hadwin Stephenson had been sitting on the chair, staring at Lina through the surveillance video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The other people in the room dared not say anything. After all, Hadwin Stephenson was emitting an intimidating aura, which stopped people from approaching him. How could they ask him anything? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When it was nine, Lina suddenly got up and put away the small stool she was sitting on. Then... Hadwin Stephenson's eyes suddenly narrowed. 'Is she leaving?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is she only persisting until nine?&rsquo;Hadwin Stephenson was filled with a feeling of loss and irritability that even he could not explain. He stared intently at the screen. Moments later, he suddenly got up and said to the person beside him, "Bring this woman inside!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Huh?" His subordinate froze. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is Mr. Stephenson... going to see this woman?'</p></div>
