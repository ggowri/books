        <h1>Chapter 548</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla soon came to her senses. She stepped forward to take her son from Jason and said, "Thank you. I'll carry Nelson into the room first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Kyla took Nelson in her arms and headed to the backroom behind the small restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw this and said to Jason, "I'll have a word with Kyla. Give me a minute." Then, she followed her into the backroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace entered the room, Kyla was putting Nelson on the bed. She pulled over the quilt and gently covered her son with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for taking care of Nelson today, Grace." Kyla thanked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly and looked straight at Kyla, saying, "I met Martin Weiss today, Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The words &lsquo;Martin Weiss&rsquo; made Kyla stiffen suddenly, and her face paled. "He..." She had just started talking but could not go on anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she did not know how to start or how to ask. Her eyes were filled with a layer of fear and tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the initiative to say, "It was just a chance encounter because Nelson lost his cochlear implant and went to the restroom to look for it. He met Martin Weiss there." As she spoke, she took Nelson's cochlear implant out of her bag and handed it to Kyla. "Also, Martin Weiss doesn&rsquo;t know Nelson&rsquo;s his child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's pupils shrunk immediately as she looked at Grace in shock. Her heart was in a sea of shock. Nelson's identity had always been her secret, and few people knew it, but now... "You knew?" she asked jadedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Jason mentioned Martin Weiss to me before, and I thought of a case I had read back then. I sort of guessed your relationship with Martin Weiss, and Nelson actually looks a little similar to Martin Weiss," said Grace. Then, she added sheepishly, "I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, this was a matter of privacy, and no one wanted to be found out about their miserable past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla forced out a smile. "What are you so sorry about that? By the way, I remember you said you were a lawyer before. You said you've read the files, so you should know what the case was about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was framed, but unfortunately, no one believed me when I said it," said Kyla. It was such agonizing despair that even her mother did not believe her at first because her relationship with her mother was extremely strained. It was only after Nelson's birth that her mother did not want her to suffer too much, so their relationship eased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I believe you. Although... Uh, there's nothing to prove your innocence, but I believe in you," said Grace. She too had suffered from being framed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She chose to become a lawyer back then because she believed that the law was always fair. However, after experiencing it personally, she realized that even though the law was just, witnesses and evidence could lie. As such, the law was not always just.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes reddened a little. "Thank you, Grace. Thank you for believing me, and thank you for not letting Martin Weiss know that Nelson is his child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long do you intend to hide this? I heard from Jason that Martin Weiss is looking for you everywhere," Grace asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't let him find us. As for Nelson's identity, I'll tell him everything when he's an adult. Then, it's up to him to decide!" said Kyla.</p></div>
