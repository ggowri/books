        <h1>Chapter 3684</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, can we really see Derick Currey later?" Jasmine asked eagerly. Her beautiful black eyes were filled with anticipation. He was the new star she had recently become a fan of, and his songs were really good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, Chandler and the concert organizers have made arrangements. We can go directly to the backstage to see Derick!" Tina said proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of being a fan, she inherited her mother's style, and with Chandler's help, she was naturally happier than most fans. She could meet her idol directly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget our three rules," Chandler reminded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina waved her hand casually. "I know, I promise to follow them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What three rules?" Jasmine asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at Jasmine, who had big round eyes, and then at Mason, who looked like a block of ice. She awkwardly smiled and said, "Hehe, I'll tell you when we have the chance in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called "three rules of agreement" refer to when Chandler helped her pursue her idol. She had to make sure she met the idol, couldn't embrace the opposite-sex idol warmly, couldn't avoid talking to the idol alone, and if she agreed to meet the idol again, Chandler had to be present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, Tina felt a bit nauseous. What kind of "three rules of agreement" were these? But who made Chandler use such a gentle voice that day to make this agreement with her? That voice, coupled with his handsome face, left her stunned and she agreed in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, Tina couldn't help but glance at Chandler standing next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she's already in junior high school, and she understands many things. In their class, there are students who are already in love and dating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she was very young, she knew that she and Chandler had a marriage agreement. When they grew up, they would get married like mommy and daddy and live together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And some of her friends, upon learning that Chandler was her fianc&eacute;, envied her and said she was so lucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what would it feel like to date Chandler? Would they have to date again before they got married?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, isn't it necessary to date before getting married?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she couldn't imagine what it would be like for the two of them to date in the future. Would it be like those classmates in her class who were dating? Walking home together every day, holding hands, and buying snacks for each other?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? What are you thinking about?" Chandler's voice suddenly sounded in Tina's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-nothing." She quickly replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's go in first. This way, you still have some time to meet your idol in the backstage." Chandler said, taking Tina's hand and walking towards the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the hand held by the other party and thought of those classmates in her class who were dating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come to think of it, she and Chandler often held hands and such. Of course, when it came to buying snacks, it was usually Chandler who bought them for her. As for walking home together...well, Chandler wasn't a student at their school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chandler had come to pick her up from school many times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina shook her head to clear her mind of everything else. The most important thing now was to meet Derick as soon as possible!</span></p></div>
