        <h1>Chapter 4345 She Finally Saw His Face Clearly</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stepped forward, sizing up the boy in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had met Calvert twice before, each time he was battered and bruised, so much so that she didn't really know what he looked like. The only thing she was sure of was his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pair of eyes that leave a deep impression, truly beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, as she looked into those eyes again, Harley was finally certain. The person in front of her was indeed Calvert, the one she had helped twice before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see what just happened?" Calvert asked hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yep, I see it." Harley nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Calvert's face turned red, a mix of embarrassment and awkwardness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Calvert had just rejected that girl, he still didn't want Harley to witness that scene. It felt as if he was exposing an unsightly side of himself to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those girls who claimed to like him, never really took him seriously!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like every time, Calvert's unbearable side was always seen by Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I didn't expect that you're the type to date with marriage in mind," Harley said. After all, in college, many people date just for the sake of dating, not many </span><span>think</span><span> about getting married in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's face instantly turned even redder, making the atmosphere a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, I'll be going now," Harley said. After all, she and Calvert weren't really close and didn't have much to talk about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to turn around and take a step, a hand suddenly grabbed her wrist: "Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley turned his head, looking at Calvert with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the other person, it was clear that only at this moment, they seemed to snap back to reality, abruptly pulling back their hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry!" Calvert was also startled by his own actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, Calvert instinctively didn't want her to leave like that. He wanted to talk to her a bit more. His body reacted before his mind did, reaching out to grab her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anything else?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I..." Calvert hesitated for a moment before finally saying, "Can I take you out for a meal? You've helped me twice, and I'd like to treat you to a meal. But I can't afford anything too expensive, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued speaking, Calvert's head gradually lowered, his voice becoming softer and softer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inviting Harley to dinner would only expose more of his unbearable side to her, wouldn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Calvert's tight financial situation, he could only afford to treat Harley to the cheapest of meals. But considering her status and position, how could she possibly be satisfied with that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's lips quivered slightly. Just as he was about to apologize and ask Harley to </span><span>pretend</span><span> she hadn't heard his words, he heard her voice ringing in his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, let's grab a bite. How about the snack shop next to the school?" suggested Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at the person in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The snack shop near the school was very affordable, making it a popular choice for students on a tight budget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also a place he often frequented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what Calvert didn't expect was that Harley would actually bring it up on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really going to eat there?" Calvert asked, hardly able to believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, were you joking when you said you'd treat me to dinner?" Harley asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not!" Calvert quickly denied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'm not joking either," Harley said with a slight smile, a smile that gave Calvert a momentarily dazzling sensation.</span></p></div>
