        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was even a large number of fans declaring online that they were going to leave the fandom, and swore to hate Lily forever.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, several of Lily's loyal fans expressed their disbelief and suspected that there had been a mistake made during one of the investigative stages.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Similarly, Lily was also skeptical.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The police had actually issued an investigative report, and yet she had found out about it at the same time as the other online users.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A shiver ran through Lily's body. How could this be?!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did it mean that the public image she had built up these past few years and the career she fought so hard for would be ruined in a day?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And yet, the worst had yet to come&hellip;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the Reed Group, Jason's personal secretary, Terrence directly called both the Atkinson and Stevens families to inform them of his employer's non-attendance at their engagement dinner.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone naturally associated it with Lily's current negative press.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace saw the police-issued investigation report, she was somewhat surprised.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had not been expecting it to be released so quickly and that both Sean and Lily had been unable to brush this under the table.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That Lily sure is detestable. That day, she wanted so many of us to look for the ring, and ultimately, she hadn't really lost anything!?&rdquo; In the Sanitation Service Center, everyone was wildly commenting on the incident.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's no wonder this is going viral&mdash;she&rsquo;s heinous.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But this really doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. I mean, she's such a huge celebrity, why would she claim that she lost a ring and want us to look for it?" Someone asked confusedly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;She has nothing better to do."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Claire pulled Grace aside and asked, "That day&hellip; I noticed Lily speaking with you for quite some time. Do you know her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Farah Steele, who happened to be walking past at that moment, heard the question and mockingly replied, "Claire, are you joking? Grace might know Lily, but how would Lily know Grace? She's a socialite from a respected family."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But I saw Lily and Grace talking the day of the incident.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Maybe Grace offended Lily. That's why such a huge celebrity would intentionally claim that she lost a ring," Farah replied. Then, she continued as if she had captured the culprit, "Well done, Grace. It turns out that you were the one who dragged everyone into looking through the rubbish with you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Farah persisted in finding fault with Grace because Chase had a crush on her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true nor is it fair,&rdquo; Claire said. &ldquo;Why would you blame this incident on Grace?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's cold gaze swept across Farah. "So if someone is being deceitful, you don't shame that person but blame someone else for hurting that deceitful person? Your perception of right and wrong sure is interesting."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Farah's face turned red and she had no way of refuting. She could only glare at Grace with hatred before stomping away.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the Atkinson family mansion, Lily and her father stood with bated breath in the large hall as they waited for Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You immature girl, how could you have stirred up such trouble? Grace is currently just a sanitation worker. There's such a huge difference in both of your social standings. What is there to compare?" Harold blamed his daughter.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why did she have to murder my sister? If it weren't for her, Jason wouldn't have taken his anger out on the Stevens family. It&rsquo;s all her fault! And what about the projection ads that Sean commissioned &mdash;did you forget about those? Jason Reed had all of those taken down too!&rdquo; Lily shouted.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harold's expression shifted. His lips moved slightly but he ultimately remained silent.</p></div>
