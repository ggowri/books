        <h1>Chapter 1954</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she did not expect his mother to lay a hand on her right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You'll get convicted for doing this!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But it&rsquo;s just an accidental bump. We'll get convicted for accidental assault at most. Don't worry, my men are mentally prepared," Emily Flowers said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her indifferent expression made her look like she did not care that a life was about to be killed and this little life was related to her by blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers sat on the couch and continued sipping on her tea as if waiting for a show to unfold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina tried to rush out of the private room. However, one of the men grabbed her while the other was about to swing his fist at her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No!" she shouted hysterically, desperately trying to protect her belly. As the man&rsquo;s fist drew near, only despair was left in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is the baby going to leave me like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'The baby already encountered several dangers and survived two close miscarriages but are they going to leave me now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'No! I can&rsquo;t let this happen. They're my and Hadwin's baby!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had no idea where she got the strength. Her body suddenly lurched as she was half-bent over. She used her unrestrained hand to catch the fist that came at her and she bit the man's hand hard without thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her only thought at the moment was to save the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Slap! Someone slapped her hard in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina still did not let go. Even if she knew that it was a futile attempt that would only make her suffer more and the baby would not survive regardless, she still did it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was an instinct&mdash;a mother's instinct to protect her child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Slap, slap, slap. The sound of slapping rang non-stop in the private room. Just when Lina felt her cheeks going numb from the pain, someone suddenly tried to open the door of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, no one from the outside could get in as the door was locked from the inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Who is it? Who's at the door?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just as Lina was speculating, the door was suddenly kicked open from the outside and a tall figure came into Lina's sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It's Hadwin!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's eyes suddenly watered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was immediately furious when he saw what was going on. The thin figure was being subdued while she bit a man's hand hard. Her hands were being restrained. Her cheeks were red and swollen, her hair was disheveled, and she looked like a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he had not gotten here, what would have happened to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson immediately rushed forward and kicked the two men out of the way. He picked up Lina in his arms and looked at his mother with eyes full of anger. "I told you not to interfere in our matters. I'll not let this go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is... Is this how you talk to your mother? This woman only wants to use her baby to join the Stephenson family. I just don't want a bastard to ruin your and the Stephenson family's reputation!" Emily Flowers said with a scowl on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson sneered. "Who dares to call my child bastard? I'd like to see how the child is going to ruin my and the Stephenson family's reputation!"</p></div>
