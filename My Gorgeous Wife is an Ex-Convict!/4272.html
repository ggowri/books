        <h1>Chapter 4270 Severing Ties</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The parents of the Stephenson family and the Hunter family met at the Hunter family's home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was Tina who proposed the divorce and actually went through with it. In this matter, the Stephenson family was always in the wrong, so Hadwin and Lina agreed to hold the meeting here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the atmosphere of the meeting was not very friendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele angrily said, "Don't forget, when Lina was in difficult labor and saved your lives, how did you promise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina said, "But when it comes to feelings, they can't be forced. Tina is my daughter, and I know she used to love Chandler very much, but now that she has lost her memory and wants a divorce, as a mother, I don't want to see her suffer, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So should my son suffer then?" Adele said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was about her son's life and death, so at this moment, she had abandoned her usual demeanor as a noblewoman and only appeared as a desperate mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry," Lina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also couldn't bear to hurt Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after all, Tina was her own child, so she naturally leaned towards her own daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she knew her daughter was in the wrong this time, she still wanted to do her best to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does sorry matter? Do you not know how my son treated your daughter? When Tina went missing, Chandler almost lost his life too, and now, Tina has returned, but Chandler is really..." about to lose his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele couldn't bring herself to say the last few words, only tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colin quickly patted his wife's shoulder and handed her tissues to wipe away her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that the two children have divorced, and according to the divorce agreement, Quinn will be raised by the Stephenson family, and the Hunter family will only have visitation rights. But Quinn is still a Hunter by name and is currently the only child of the Hunter family, so we hope that when the child is a little older, they can spend one-third of the year living with the Hunter family," Colin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina hesitated, one-third of the time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a mother, if she couldn't see her child for one-third of the time, she would definitely miss them very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine!" Hadwin, however, was the first to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Lina didn't speak up either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In addition, all the projects that the Stephenson family and the Hunter family were cooperating on will now be handed over to the Hunter family, and the Stephenson family will withdraw from the projects," Colin continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Stephenson family and the Hunter family have naturally had many cooperative projects over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the Stephenson family is completely withdrawing, it is undoubtedly a huge loss for the Stephenson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine!" Hadwin answered without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lastly, the two families will sever all ties, except for Quinn, </span><span>There</span><span> will be no more relationship between us, and there will be no business dealings in the future!" Colin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is equivalent to cutting off contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadwin sighed, knowing that when the Hunter family said such words, the bond between the two families had truly come to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, we'll do everything as you said!" Hadwin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Hadwin and Lina left, Adele was still not satisfied: "Is that really it? Chandler waited for Tina for so many years, </span><span>How</span><span> can the Stephenson family just say 'let's get divorced' like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else can we do? They have already divorced, and Chandler agreed to it himself." At this point, the meeting between the parents was just to settle the divorce matter!</span></p></div>
