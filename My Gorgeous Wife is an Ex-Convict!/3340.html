        <h1>Chapter 3338</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Grace was very puzzled. She had only left for a while, so what could have happened?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper didn't say anything, but William said, "I want to go see the musical with Jasper, but I don't know if she wants to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The musical?" Grace was stunned for a moment, then she saw the flyer for the musical in her daughter's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she suddenly remembered that two months ago, when her daughter and Lawrence were still on good terms, they had indeed mentioned that they wanted to go see a musical together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the tickets were difficult to purchase, the daughter specifically asked for her help in buying them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, the topic of buying tickets was never brought up again because of the conflict that arose between the daughter and Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right now, Grace said to her daughter, "Jasper, do you want to go see a musical with William?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Jasper hesitated for a moment and whispered, "I don't think we can buy tickets now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to go with William, Mommy will take care of the tickets," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, would you like to come with me to see it?" William asked earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at William for a while and finally nodded, "Okay... let's go together to see it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William smiled, and Grace gently touched their daughter's head. "Mommy will go buy tickets, and we'll all go see a musical together the day after tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Jasper responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She will go to see it the day after tomorrow, take notes, and when she finds Lawrence later, she can tell him all about the musical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she had a lot, a lot of things she wanted to say to Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wants to say to him - I'm sorry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If only she hadn't argued with him back then, and if only she had answered his call at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lost his family, but she will treat him like family from now on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, Jason asked Grace in their room, "Is Jasper going to see the musical with William?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, originally she planned to go see that musical with Lawrence. I don't think William is very interested in that musical, but he acted interested just for Jasper's sake," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although William tries hard to show his interest in musicals and really wants to go see them, he is only a 10-year-old child after all. Sometimes he can come across as too deliberate, and he hasn't yet learned how to completely hide his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In addition, Grace being a lawyer and having met all kinds of people, she can naturally see through William's intentions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It is precisely because of this observation that one naturally understands the child's intentions towards Jasper even more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about the jokes she and her husband used to make, Grace really feels that if the two children can really fall in love in the future, having a husband like William who treats her well is also a blessing for Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's fine, how about the day after tomorrow? I'll accompany you guys since I'm free anyway," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Grace responded. "When do you think Jasper can start to lessen the shadow of the Abbott family situation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Grace never gave up on searching for Lawrence's whereabouts, deep down she knew the chances of finding him again were very slim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter how many years pass, it will eventually fade away. Jasper is still just a child now. In the future, let's help her find some new friends, and she will naturally forget about Lawrence over time," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it really that simple?" Grace doubted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But some people will be remembered in the heart for a lifetime," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think Lawrence has the ability to be remembered by Jasper for a lifetime?" Jason said skeptically, "He's just a kid who plays the piano well. But in the future, Jasper will meet many more geniuses who play the piano even better than Lawrence. Even if she doesn't forget Lawrence, she won't be so sad and heartbroken like this again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it really true?" Grace doubted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, only time can verify this kind of thing.</p></div>
