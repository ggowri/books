        <h1>Chapter 449</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing, I just want to hold you like this for a while," he whispered, burying his face deep in her neck and smelling her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if just hugging her like this could comfort him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought that Jason's behavior right now was a little childish. He was like a child holding onto his precious toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her hand and gently hugged Jason back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment she put her hands around him, his body suddenly trembled a little. After a while, his low voice rang in her ears, "I like the way you're holding me, Sis. Will you hold me a little longer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tone was affectionate. She could not say no.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," she answered while continuing to hold him. She let time fly in silence...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Early the next morning, Lina arrived at Reed Residence's entrance on time to pick them up. However, other than Lina, Hadwin had also come. He was the driver. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only the car he was driving was Lina's cheap car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin and Jason stared at each other at Reed Residence's gate while Lina took the initiative to drag Grace into the back of the car for a girlfriends&rsquo; gathering where they could talk more freely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, due to Grace's busy work schedule, the two could only meet once every two weeks or one month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Hadwin driving later?" asked Grace. After all, it was Hadwin who drove here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Lina shrugged. "When it comes to things like driving, just let men contribute." Hadwin was going to drive his multi-million dollar luxury car, but Lina thought it was too ostentatious to drive it to a detention center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, if they were to swap drivers midway, she was worried about an accident happening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for her rattletrap, she was used to driving it. Even if it was hit, there would not be a crazily expensive repair bill!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she insisted on driving her own car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Hadwin did not argue with her about it and drove it over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have any key questions you want to ask him today?" asked Lina. That was their concern today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. "It's all in my notes, but I won't be able to talk to him myself. He probably still remembers what I look like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin found a mediator to help him settle the dispute. The mediator will ask the key questions," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace never expected Hadwin to think of such details. "By the way, how did the witness get into the detention center?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly noticed that it should not be so coincidental that when they investigated the witness, the witness happened to be in detention. Plus, Hadwin had even found a mediator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina chuckled. "Hadwin got a gang of people to get drunk and get into trouble with the man. Then, he started to hit them and is now being detained."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Grace was at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That witness You is not a good man anyway. He made a lot of money out of your case, and he got a bargain, so he&rsquo;s only being detained at the detention center." Lina had no sympathy for the witness.</p></div>
