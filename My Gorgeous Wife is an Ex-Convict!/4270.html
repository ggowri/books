        <h1>Chapter 4268 His Alienation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is he in the hospital? Could it be because of his health..." Tina's mind suddenly flashed with thoughts about the curse of the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be related to that curse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The specific situation is not clear yet, but ever since you disappeared, his health has not been good," Lina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, she felt a pang of heartache for Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During that time, she watched the child become increasingly thin, watched him collapse stiffly from exhaustion, and watched him get injections in the hospital. But once he regained consciousness, he would pull out the needles and still want to go find Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many men in a woman's life would care for her like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meeting him was indeed fortunate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned. Chandler's health has not been good all along?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had no idea about it. When she woke up in the hospital and saw Chandler, he always appeared in a normal state in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Tina, don't think too much. Your dad and I will talk to the Hunter family and discuss the details of your divorce. Since you're already divorced from Chandler, just live your life as you want from now on," Lina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt heavy-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can she really live a good life from now on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can she live the life she wants?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Hadwin and Lina went out to meet Chandler's parents, while Tina came to the hospital alone after her parents left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't explain her state of mind. Clearly, she wanted to divorce him, to put an end to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why couldn't she help but want to come to the hospital to visit him when she found out he was hospitalized? Wanting to know how his health was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed fine that day! Why was he hospitalized?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's ward was the hospital's VIP ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina walked to the door of the ward, feeling inexplicably anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should she say when she sees him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina?" However, a familiar voice suddenly sounded behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina turned her head abruptly, and that familiar figure came into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only difference from what she had seen before was that he wasn't wearing a suit at the moment, but a hospital gown. His slightly pale face gave him a touch of fragility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not in the ward?" It took Tina a while to finally utter a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I went to the attending physician's office to have a talk," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something wrong with your health? Is it serious?" Tina suddenly became nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at the person in front of him. If it weren't for her insisting on getting a divorce, her current nervousness would have made him misunderstand and think that she liked him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No misunderstandings, and he must not indulge in his feelings because of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they were already divorced, his health should no longer concern her, so she didn't need to worry about it, right?" Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback. Chandler's voice sounded distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time she heard him speak to her in such a tone as if there was a great distance between them!</span></p></div>
