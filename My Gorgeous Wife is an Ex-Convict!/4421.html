        <h1>Chapter 4419: Not Good at Trading</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time kept passing day by day, and Harley noticed that ever since she mentioned she was dating Calvert with marriage in mind, he finally seemed less insecure than before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I sometimes still feel insecure, I am getting better day by day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I'm with her, even under the gaze of others, I no longer keep my head down in silence like I used to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that he was trying hard to change.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two years flew by just like that. During this time, Calvert took part in even more films and TV shows, and his fame grew even larger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, people often referred to him as Miss Hart's boyfriend, but now, they're gradually starting to call him by his name.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other people's eyes, he was no longer just Harley's boyfriend; he had his own name--Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gradually shifted from a supporting role to the main character, and the role he played received high praise and positive market feedback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was only nominated for Best Actor this time and didn't win, others saw even greater potential in him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's father naturally wanted to extort more from his son, but thanks to the intervention of the Hart family, no major trouble ensued.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although no media dared to report on Mr. Elledge, he would still occasionally harass Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the guise of generosity, the Hart family is so wealthy, and since he's going to be their future in-law, it's only natural that they would offer him some benefits.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me a mansion and a hundred million dollars, and from now on, I won't bother you anymore. You can pretend I don't exist, Miss Hart. You can afford that, can't you?" Mr. Elledge once again showed up in front of Harley, making his demands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley chuckled, "Why did the amount you're asking for go up? Wasn't it 50 million before?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things were different before, but now, my son is nominated for Best Actor. If he actually wins, the amount I'm asking for will definitely go up--it'll keep increasing! So, why not just give me a billion now? That way, you won't have to worry about me raising the price later!" Mr. Elledge said shamelessly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley burst into angry laughter. Did this person really treat Calvert as an object to be traded?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert still has his original good nature and hasn't become twisted. That's really something to be thankful for.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already said last time, I won't use Calvert as a bargaining chip!" Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Elledge's expression changed, "I've raised my son all these years, and you won't contribute at all? He's your boyfriend after all. Don't you care about his father's well-being at all?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've said it before, as long as you're capable of working, you should support yourself. When you get old, Calvert and I will fulfill our legal obligations to provide for you, but beyond that, don't expect anything more!" Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew all too well about gamblers like Mr. Elledge. They were like bottomless pits; no matter how much money you gave them, they'd just gamble it all away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Mr. Elledge glared at Harley, "Are you really planning to let me get chopped up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley frowned as she heard Mr. Elledge say, "I'm currently millions in debt from gambling outside. They said if I don't pay back within a month, they'll kill me. If I die, do you think you and my son will be alright? You'll be seen as the murderer who killed his father. Even if my son doesn't like me much, he won't stay with you when that time comes!"</span></p></div>
