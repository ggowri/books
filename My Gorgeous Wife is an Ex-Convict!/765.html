        <h1>Chapter 764</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was the first time he had actually set foot here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he followed the search party step by step through the dense forest, his mind flashed back to the painting by Brian that he had seen in the studio at the Hart familyHart family's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the painting, a petite girl carried a little boy on her back as she walked through the dense forest step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little girl's back was bent low as if almost crushed by the weight of the little boy. However, even so, the little girl carried him with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every step was so difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not feel anything when he first saw the painting, but now, if he put in the likeness of Grace and Brian, he panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What on earth am I panicking about? Am I panicking because I've done so many things in secret but still couldn't break the bond between her and Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or am I panicking at the thought that Brian will always be in her heart? Even if she has forgotten about him, what if she remembers him someday&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or perhaps I&rsquo;m panicking that her love for me is not as deep or much, so I&rsquo;m scared that she&rsquo;d betray me one day?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed, you don't look too well. Why don't you take a rest?" said Terrence who was on the side. Young Master Reed's face was unusually pale right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason shook his head. "No thanks. It's getting dark. Keep looking!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The longer the delay, the more he worried!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were more and more trees in the forest. It was the height of summer, and the leaves were luxuriant, overlapping with one another and even blocking out much of the light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait, there seems to be a noise ahead. It sounds like footsteps!" shouted one of the search party members at the front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, everyone stopped in their tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Step by step, the footsteps were steady and strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, a figure slowly walked into everyone's sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a man walking with a woman on his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's pupils constricted immediately, and he felt as if his blood had suddenly frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... Brian and Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did my worst fears happen anyway? It&rsquo;s as if the characters in the painting I saw have their roles reversed.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was lying on the man's back, her head buried low. He was unable to see the expression on her face while the man was walking forward step by step...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Brian stopped walking and looked this way. His phoenix eyes froze a little when he saw the search party with search and rescue gears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, his phoenix eyes looked past the men in front of him and looked at the tall figure standing among them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His deep phoenix eyes met a pair of dark peach blossom eyes. Brian looked directly at Jason. He did not expect to meet him here today. What... A bustling scene!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Grace had been feeling a bit groggy because her head still hurt a little after her headache. She could not help asking after sensing that Brian had stopped. Then, she looked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace caught sight of the tall figure, and she said immediately in surprise, "Jay... Jay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is Jason here? What's with all these people?'</p></div>
