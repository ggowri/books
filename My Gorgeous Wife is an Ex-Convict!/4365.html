        <h1>Chapter 4363 We Can't Be Friends</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley saw Calvert again at a charity dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert came along with his agency's boss. As a newbie in the modeling industry, such treatment is rare.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was dressed in a black suit, his bangs combed back to reveal his full forehead. He looked less like a naive schoolboy and more like a mature man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley watched from a distance as Calvert chatted with the people around him, a faint smile playing on his lips. He looked like a completely different person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the large dye vat that was the entertainment industry, how many people could truly remain unchanged?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Karen was right, people did change.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley, holding a glass of red wine, stepped out to the garden of the banquet for some fresh air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At today's banquet, since her parents couldn't make it due to some matters, she attended on behalf of the Hart family to </span><span>make a donation</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was a charity banquet, she still felt a sense of discomfort that permeated the event.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she was surrounded by people who wanted to curry favor with her, making her quite uncomfortable. Especially after she broke off her engagement with Lornell, the number of young and talented men appearing before her noticeably increased.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She naturally understood what these people were up to, but she just didn't like them very much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley finally reached the garden, letting out a long sigh of relief. She finally felt alive again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the sound of footsteps echoed from behind her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley frowned. It seemed that even coming to this place couldn't bring her peace!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to leave, a familiar voice rang out: "Long time no see!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley froze. This voice was...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned around, looking at the person standing behind her. It was Lornell, her former fianc&eacute;!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breaking off their engagement, this was </span><span>actually the</span><span> first time they had met.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long time no </span><span>see</span><span>!" She replied politely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell gazed at Harley, "How have you been lately?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay," she said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After we broke off our engagement, you never reached out to me again. I thought, even though we ended our engagement, we've known each other for so many years, we should still be friends," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley gently lowered his eyelids, wondering, "Are we friends?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the very beginning, she didn't see him as a friend, but as someone she could spend her entire life with.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she became his </span><span>fianc</span><span>&eacute;e, she remembered that he was her benefactor, the person she needed to repay with gratitude, and the one she wanted to be with forever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like her daddy and mommy, always together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their beginning was like something out of a fairy tale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just because there was a fairy tale beginning, didn't mean there was a fairy tale ending.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the outcome they faced was nothing more than parting ways.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think we're necessarily cut out to be friends," Harley said with a self-deprecating smile, looking at Lornell. After all, she had been in love with him for so many years. Now, to treat him as a friend was somewhat difficult. At least she didn't know how she would feel about his love life when he found someone he loved in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Harley paused, "If we happen to meet somewhere, I don't see any problem with giving you a proper greeting."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now you don't even want to be friends with me?" Lornell frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that apart from our identities as each other's </span><span>fianc</span><span>&eacute;s, we didn't really have much in common in terms of hobbies and social circles. I think, after breaking off our engagement, it </span><span>would be better for both of us to keep some distance, don't you agree?" she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because of that model named Calvert?" Lornell abruptly asked.</span></p></div>
