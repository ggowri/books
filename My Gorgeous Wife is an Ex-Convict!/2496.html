        <h1>Chapter 2494</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, Mom, do you wish to live with such a person?" George Gregory asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Madam Gregory thought for a moment before sighing. "Then tell me, do you want to divorce Louise Mitchell purely just because of what she did or because her actions hurt Amber Mitchell? If she had hurt someone else, would you still be asking for a divorce?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory pressed his thin lips together tightly. "No, I&rsquo;m not divorcing her because of Amber Mitchell. What happened between me and Amber Mitchell is in the past. I don't want to remember it since it's in the past."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, it was in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words were meant for himself more than his mother. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kept telling himself to stop thinking about Amber Mitchell. Even if he still had feelings for the woman, he should take all of them back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">... </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was returning to Emerald City, and Amber Mitchell came to the airport to see her off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace did not expect Brian to see her off too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whitney Cooper must have caused you some trouble by coming to see you previously," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not really. I was just a little surprised. I didn't expect her to be your private secretary." Grace looked at Brian and said, "I know I have no right to say anything about your private affairs, but if the only reason you hired her as your private secretary is to find a substitute, then... you're just stressing yourself out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, not wanting the man to be stuck in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled with a hint of bitterness. "I understand. Don't worry, I won't find any more substitutes. That person is no longer my private secretary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how much that person looked like her, she was not her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You fired her?" Grace said with some surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just couldn't bear to see her working in a nightclub back then, so I let her work as a private secretary for a while. Even though I&rsquo;ve fired her, she can live a fairly comfortable life with the things I've given her as long as she behaves herself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the time. It was almost time to board the plane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I should board the plane now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, safe trip!" said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian gazed at Grace as if he was unwilling to say goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was about to watch this woman leave again. He seemed to keep watching her leave him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Goodbye," Grace said to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pressed his lips together and held out his right hand. He did not want to say goodbye to her, but he was content with shaking her hand as a goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace held out her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their hands clasped together. Brian looked blankly at their linked hands and felt the warmth coming from her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, he seemed to recall his childhood when she held his hand tightly on the hill to keep him from falling off the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If only he could have held her hand tight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned instantly and jerked her hand away. She covered her mouth and rushed to the nearby washroom, where she began to throw up violently.</p></div>
