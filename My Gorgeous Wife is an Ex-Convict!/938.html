        <h1>Chapter 937</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I be afraid?" she asked, confused. "I like you, and you like me. Isn't it normal?" Of course, she could not let her conservative parents know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Also... It would help her to remember how they had sex. She had no memory of their previous sexual encounters!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chuckled suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Puzzled, she asked, "What are you laughing at? Do you think I'm too aggressive?" 'Um... It&rsquo;s indeed true that I'm not very reserved in a way.' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was only unreserved with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No wonder you're the woman I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with!" He removed his finger and kissed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This kiss was burning and lingering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His Lina was passionate and sincere. He never needed to play tricks in front of her. He did not need to arm himself to resist all the thunderstorms. He could take off his thick armor and show his true self!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was lucky to have met her and fallen in love with her! Unknowingly, she seemed to have become his salvation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought, 'I'll spend my whole life loving this woman!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time Grace got back to work, the redness and swelling on her face had almost subsided. She was able to conceal her face with a bit of powder, and no one could tell a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was time to get off work, the Reed family&rsquo;s driver came to pick her up in the Maybach again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins, Master Reed asked me to pick you up,&rdquo; the driver said respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and got into the car. Even if she refused, Jason had thousands of ways to get her to see him anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps their relationship could only be over when he was tired of the game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz continued to hide in the dark where she took photos of Grace getting in the Maybach. &lsquo;The more the better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Such &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; will be great material to instigate a fight later on!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just a pity that Curtis Row was not here to pick Grace up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be even more interesting if Curtis Row came in person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got into the car, still thinking about the car accident compensation case. Baldwin's parents had called her again, crying that their family was broke now. If they could not get the compensation, Baldwin would have to stop the more effective medicine he was taking now and switch to a less effective treatment program.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that way, Baldwin was even less likely to wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was anxious, but there was nothing she could do. She was just a lawyer... A mere paralegal now. All she could do was to collect information and find useful evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some information was protected by privacy regulations, so she had no access to it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For example, Pansy Dittman and the actress, Elise Dean, must have made a deal involving money. That was why Pansy Dittman took the blame. However, she had no right to go to the bank to retrieve their transfer records.</p></div>
