        <h1>Chapter 2754</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In just a short while, two adorable cartoons were sketched out with simple brush strokes. Brian could see at a glance that these cartoons were based on him and Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's do it like this." Valda Theller finished the drawing and handed the pen and paper back to the stall owner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The stall owner was amazed as they looked at the drawing. Then, they replied, "Okay, you can pick them up in a week. These two dolls cost a total of 220 dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was familiar with the stall owner and knew that the price was the lowest they could offer. She was about to pay when Brian said, "Let me pay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he took out his phone and scanned the code to pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anything else?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you look at some jewelry? We got a new batch of handmade jewelry. They're 100% handmade," the stall owner said enthusiastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had no interest in such jewelry, of course. However, Valda Theller looked at them with interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly saw a pair of silver bracelets. The bracelets were neutral and suitable for both genders. They were also adjustable, so one did need not worry about whether they fit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller picked up the bracelets and looked at them carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The stall owner nearby began to talk, "This is a pair of couple bracelets. They're best worn by a man and a woman. Besides, they go with anything you wear..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned to look at Brian. "Well... Would you mind wearing this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes quivered slightly as he looked at the bracelet she was holding. 'A silver bracelet? What a coincidence. Grace also gave me a silver bracelet when she was a child.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The silver bracelet became his obsession for years. He used to carry the silver bracelet with him all the time. It was not until Grace got married that he finally stopped wearing it and put it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now... Valda Theller was asking him if he would wear a silver bracelet as she held two in her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to reject her almost subconsciously, but the words of rejection were stuck in his throat when he saw hope in those round eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Couple bracelets... Since we're now a real couple, it makes sense to wear couple bracelets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides, maybe... I can better hide my feelings for Grace after wearing it. I can use the bracelet to remind me that I should love Valda Theller!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want me to wear it, I'll do it," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Valda Theller's eyes lit up. Brian only found her eyes to be twinkling like stars. They look exceptionally beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he replied as he reached out to take one of the bracelets she was holding and slipped it onto his left wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it was only a common silver bracelet, it was not ugly to wear on the wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller wore the other bracelet on her right hand and put it next to Brian's left hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two identical bracelets did look good on the wrists of the man and woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take these bracelets. How much are they?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The cheapest I can offer you is 700 dollars for the pair," the stall owner said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was about to pay when Valda Theller quickly said, "You've paid for the dolls just now. Let me pay for this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not used to women paying," he said.</p></div>
