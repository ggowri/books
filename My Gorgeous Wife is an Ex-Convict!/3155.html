        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, he walked out of the bedroom and came to the study. The secretary was already waiting there. As soon as he saw Brian, he stood up and said, "Mr. Hart, this is about the current situation of the Tracy family. They have transferred a sum of money overseas. They are probably going to flee the country before the trouble with the company is exposed. Although there is no direct evidence of Tracy's involvement in the Barlow family's affairs, it has been found that the people who slandered Miss Theller online were all bought by Tracy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the secretary spoke, he handed over the information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked through the information in his hand and said, "It won't be so easy for the Tracy family to escape overseas. We need to stop them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who hurt Valda must pay the price, and he will not let them off lightly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, sir," the secretary replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, besides Tracy, the two people who were with her that day and bullied Valda should also be handed over to the police," he added. He would not let those two go either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand what to do," the secretary replied before leaving the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian returned to the bedroom and looked at the person lying on the bed with endless tenderness in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda..." he murmured, leaning down and placing a kiss on her forehead with deep affection and sincerity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy's situation is still being discussed online, and the negative information that she previously suppressed with her connections and money is now being voluntarily exposed by others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nowadays, there is a lot of criticism online, and many people even think that banning her was too late. People like her should have been banned earlier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Tracy naturally has no time to worry about online comments and gossip!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, the Barlow family of three is preparing to go abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy carried her luggage and followed her parents into the airport, wearing a baseball cap, sunglasses, and a mask. They hurriedly walked inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once she goes abroad, she won't have to worry about domestic affairs anymore. Plus, she'll have the chance to make a comeback!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she gets back on her feet in the future, she will make sure that all those who have wronged her will pay the price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially Valda, she will definitely make things difficult for Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was thinking, suddenly a group of plainclothes people blocked their way. Someone directly pulled out a police officer's badge and announced the names of the Barlow family of three. "Please come with us to the police station. If you have anything to say, you can say it there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We have something urgent to catch a flight. Right now, we are still free and not restricted from entering or leaving the country!" said Mr. Barlow senior. "If there is anything, you can wait for us to come back and then come to the police station."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are now restricted from entering or leaving the country, so even if you have urgent matters abroad, it seems that you won't be able to leave," said the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is that possible!" exclaimed the Barlow family, all three of them wearing shocked expressions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's go. If you refuse, then according to the relevant laws, we have the right to take compulsory action!" said the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow family looked pale and exchanged worried glances with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could this happen?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy was almost grinding her teeth to pieces. All her plans and thoughts of getting revenge on Valda and making a comeback in the future were now impossible to achieve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, the Barlow family of three were taken to the police station, and shortly after, news of their detention spread across various media platforms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are even rumors suggesting that Tracy instructed several internet celebrities to spread various rumors and defame Valda, based on the evidence obtained by the police.</p></div>
