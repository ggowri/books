        <h1>Chapter 1058</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know how long it took, but when the kiss finally ended, she gasped like a fish on a chopping block.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her long hair was a tad unruly, and her cheeks were blushing. Her serene almond-shaped eyes were glaring at him. Finally, her eyes were no longer as calm as usual. It was as if he finally existed in her eyes again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though there was anger in her eyes, he was still fascinated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand and gently stroked her hair. Then, his lips came closer to her ear as he said in a hoarse voice, "Forget about falling for Brian..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, I won't allow her to fall for Brian. She can only fall for me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A chill ran down her spine. "It's my business who I fall for&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could finish, his lips were on hers again, swallowing all her voice...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a bit of a commotion at the charity gala too. After all, there had been a lot more commotion earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina found out that Jason cleared the area and had a conflict with Brian, she was completely stunned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason? It's alright if Jason came to the gala, but why would he seal off the area? Is it because of&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina suddenly thought of Grace. Her best friend said she was leaving earlier. Could she have run into Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Jason seal the area for... Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This idea crossed Lina's mind, but she thought it was absurd even just imagining it. Even so, her heart was still racing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took out her phone and quickly dialed Grace's number, but no one answered her call!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's expression changed. 'Did something bad&hellip; happen to Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said to Lina, "Don't worry too much. Check with Brian first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes, I should check with Brian first!" Lina said quickly before hurrying toward the exit while Hadwin Stephenson followed closely after her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they got to the exit, there was already a crowd. Lina saw a lot of reporters around Brian. They were frantically taking photos, but not one of them dared to interview him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was someone in a lilac gown next to Brian, but it was not Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing next to Brian, Stella looked at his right hand that was dangling at his side. It was unnaturally twisted. "Brian... is your hand okay? Why don't I accompany you to the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian paid her no attention. His thin lips were pressed into a straight line as he told his men, "Get these reporters out of here. I don't want to see any rumors online about what happened tonight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" his men responded, and the security guards began driving the reporters away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella gritted her teeth in displeasure. She had hoped to show off her relationship with Brian in front of the press and get onto a trending post online so that her coursemates in university and the film crew would not taunt her behind her back all day long!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now there was one less chance!</p></div>
