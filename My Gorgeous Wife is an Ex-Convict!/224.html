        <h1>Chapter 223</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although there were some top celebrities at the party tonight, Jason was not inferior to any of those A-list male celebrities. In fact, he was even more striking than they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had a beautiful face, and when he looked at people with those charming, amorous eyes, the journalists could not help but fall for him. He was too beautiful to describe. His beauty was the kind that could attract both men and women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when these eyes were cold, it gave people an indescribable tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, now with half-drooped eyes, was surrounded by his own bodyguards as well as the venue's security guards. His long, lean body was wrapped in a well-tailored black suit, making his figure look extremely well-proportioned. There was an air of elegance all over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason always had great fashion sense, which was a consensus among the journalists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, today there were exceptions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything else was fine, but&hellip; He wore a light purple scarf around his neck and a pair of gloves in the same color. These two accessories were a little strange to look at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do the scarf and gloves look a bit different from Jason's usual style?" A journalist started whispering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It looks a bit rough, and it seems... a little old too. Is it a new vintage collection from some big brand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The average man would have a hard time looking good in this light purple color! However, it seems to suit Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not like being photographed, but some reporters could not help but secretly photograph him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason's bodyguard was about to walk over, he seemed to move his lips to say something. Immediately, the bodyguard stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Jason was inside the venue, the reporter who took the candid photo gasped for breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that the bodyguard was going to come up to him and ask him to delete the contents of his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment Jason entered the venue, he naturally became the focus of attention. Almost immediately, many upper-class ladies tried their best to get close to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick walked over to Jason to examine his friend's outfit and said, "You look really sharp in your outfit. The scarf and gloves don't look like your usual style, though."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows. "What do you think my style is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Definitely not this woolen scarf and gloves. And in such a gentle color too!' Patrick thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, shall I introduce you to some of the great ladies of Emerald City?" Patrick suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Jason coolly refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick's face turned bitter. "Let me introduce you, or I'll be annoyed to death by these women." They were the precious daughters of the Weiss family's friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick would have been their first choice, but the ladies completely ignored him and desperately wanted to meet Jason through him instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick had no choice when it came to this matter. He was quite decent looking and was funny too, but women just did not like him. He could only say that there was something wrong with their eyes.</p></div>
