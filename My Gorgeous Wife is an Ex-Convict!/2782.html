        <h1>Chapter 2780</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Camille Strickland probably made it up randomly as she&rsquo;s anxious to save Valda Theller. How could a man like Brian fall in love with such an ordinary woman like Valda Theller?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was forced to drink more aggressively. She struggled desperately, but every struggle made her suffer more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The red liquor, which had not yet been swallowed, flowed down the corners of her mouth, neck, and clothes&hellip; making her look like a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop. Stop it! Stop it!" Camille Strickland shouted, tears pouring out of her eyes. "Help! Save Valda... Brian, hurry and save Valda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was answered by jeers from all around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was in despair when the laughter subsided suddenly. Then, there were several thumps of heavy objects falling and screams of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a face full of shock, Camille Strickland watched as Brian finally appeared and kicked away the man who forced Valda to drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the two people pressing Valda Theller's shoulders were quickly kicked to the floor by Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland's almost desperate eyes burst with joy while the others froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller lay on the floor, coughing. There was a burning sensation in her throat from being forced to drink, and she felt dizzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea what was going on, but she coughed instinctively until her face turned red. It was almost as if she was going to cough everything out of her stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a hand patted her gently on the back. "Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The familiar sound instantly gave Valda Theller an urge to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never cried when she was ridiculed and insulted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her nose felt so sore, and her eyes were burning as if something were pouring out of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She slowly turned to look at the person in front of her with a hazy vision. Tears burst out instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian... I feel terrible. I... I wanted to shout to get you to help me, but they kept forcing me to drink. I... I couldn't make a sound..." She sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He crouched down, raised his hand, and gently wiped her tears. The moment her tears touched his fingers, he felt his fingers were burning like hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She cried harder. Her fears seemed to pour out with the tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's hands were suddenly wrapped around Brian's neck. She buried her face in his chest and cried. She was so drunk that she was like a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her shoulders twitched as she cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to find his heart throbbing too. He felt a rare sadness when he saw her crying like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian rarely regretted things. If he had come out to look for her earlier, she would not have suffered all these.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop crying. Stop... No one will hurt you when I'm around!" Brian comforted her softly.</p></div>
