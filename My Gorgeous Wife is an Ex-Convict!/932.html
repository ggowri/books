        <h1>Chapter 931</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But does he know that it&rsquo;s not these physical wounds that had hurt me deeply, but the one to my heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I wonder when it would heal.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car stopped at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance, and Jason got off with Grace in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor was already waiting in a special room, and as soon as Grace arrived, he began his examination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, it was only some physical injuries. There was nothing to worry about. The swelling on her face would also subside in a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was done with the examination, a new set of clothes was placed in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Change into this," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she replied. Her shirt was torn at the shoulder and was indeed unwearable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She held out her hand to take it, but he did not seem to want to give it to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him quizzically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "You're hurt, so it's not very convenient for you to change yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So? Did he mean&hellip;' Grace's face went red immediately. Her red and swollen face now looked even &lsquo;brighter&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... You can ask the nurse to come in and help me change," Grace said quickly as they were now resting in a VIP lounge, waiting for the staff to fetch her medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you embarrassed? What is there to be embarrassed about? Didn't I help you change your clothes before?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That was then, and this is now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No brother helps their sister change clothes," she said as she gritted her teeth. Besides, her current state of mind could not accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips pressed into a straight line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air in the room tensed, and just when she thought he might be angry, he suddenly turned and walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, a nurse came in while holding the clothes. "Mr. Reed asked me to help you change your clothes, Miss Cummins," the nurse said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated a little before saying, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she changed her clothes, Jason walked in. "The medicine is here. Let me send you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if there had been no change in his attitude. It was as if the brief moment of tension had never existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he tried to hold her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can walk myself," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her words did not have the slightest effect. He took her in his arms and left the room. Then, he took her away from the hospital and back to her rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason put Grace carefully on a chair before going into the bathroom. A moment later, he came out with a clean wet towel. "Here, wipe your face first before applying the medicine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, instead of giving her the towel, Jason helped her wipe her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was gentle, but Grace would still gasp from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she did not complain about the pain, her suppressed expression told him that she was suffering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Cry out if it hurts," he said.</p></div>
