        <h1>Chapter 3919</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Fowler, your mother has passed away. She had saved 100,000 dollars in her account, and the master intends to give it to you as a gift. After you bury your mother, you should live your life well. As for things that shouldn't be said, don't talk about them outside!" The butler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Things that shouldn't be said? Are you referring to the fact that Clarissa pushed my mother, which caused her to fall and die?" Nancy stared at the butler with cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your mother accidentally fell and it had nothing to do with Miss Schultz. You have no evidence. If you speak recklessly, the Schultz family can sue you for defamation!" The butler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Defamation?" Nancy sneered, "So my mother died for nothing? Should Clarissa just act like nothing happened? She has blood on her hands and caused my mother's death, but she hasn't even apologized once!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, do you want to extort money from the Schultz family?" The butler looked at Nancy with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy found it ridiculous. She never wanted any money from the Schultz family. She just wanted to seek justice for her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother died in such a mysterious way, but the person who caused her death didn't even apologize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, the butler threatened, "If you dare to spread rumors, don't blame the Schultz family for making you leave Emerald City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, if she really wanted to seek justice for her mother, the Schultz family would do everything to destroy her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy held her mother's urn and came to the cemetery where she had bought a plot for her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the vast cemetery, she had spent all the money she had earned since she started working, but could only afford a cheap grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And for this funeral of her mother, some people... it was just her alone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cemetery staff helped her place the urn in the grave and then sealed the tomb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stood alone in front of her mother's tombstone, looking at the photo of her mother on the tombstone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the photo, her mother was smiling lightly, but did she ever think that after her death, it would be so desolate?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Born poor, she married into the Schultz family, but when she died, it was not under the name of Mrs. Schultz, but still just Eileen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one from the Schultz family attended her funeral.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy didn't know how long she stood in front of the tombstone until it got dark and the rain started to fall. She smiled bitterly and said to the tombstone, "Mom, I'll come see you again next time. Rest well. I'll come to see you often and talk to you. I have a lot to say to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she felt like she had so much to say, yet standing in front of the tombstone, she couldn't say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy left the cemetery and walked on the road like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rain was getting heavier, but she didn't seem to notice, walking in the rain like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sadness in her heart was all stuck in her chest, making her extremely uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother's funeral, only she was there!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she, having lost her mother, had become a person in the end!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The whole world seemed to have become empty for her, leaving her alone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Nancy was immersed in her own world, she suddenly heard a piercing horn, and then her arm was pulled back with force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy fell heavily into a broad embrace and saw only a truck speeding past her. Then, a man's voice sounded in her ear, "Are you trying to get yourself killed? Walking in the middle of the road like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy lifted her head in confusion, her vision blurred by the rain, and saw a face that was both unfamiliar and somewhat familiar.</p></div>
