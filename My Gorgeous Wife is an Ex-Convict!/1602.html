        <h1>Chapter 1600</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At noon, Grace and the rest found a restaurant in the amusement park to dine in. The two little ones were a little tired from playing, so they had great appetites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After the meal, they made a racket about playing in the restaurant's playground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many children were playing in the playground. Grace said to Jason, "I'll take the two kids there first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She headed toward the playground with the two kids, holding each in one hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared at their figures. There was a rare look of gentleness in his eyes. They were his most important family members, and he would only ever show them his gentleness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps the only thing he was worried about right now was... the real reason she left him back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What if... she left me because she couldn't accept me? What should I do? Should I find a way to make sure she never recovers that memory or...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A hint of darkness flitted through Jason's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace let the two children play in the playground while she watched from the fence outside. She also told the brother and sister to take care of each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two little ones responded. Then, Jasper ran over to the slide, happily holding her brother's hand. Grace looked at the two children playing inside with a smile. However, she could not help being stunned when her eyes caught sight of the other two figures in the corner of the playground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One of them was the same little girl she had just seen. She was crouching in front of the little boy as if telling him something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy was also crouching on the soft mat, looking at the little girl with his dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, Grace looked blankly at the little boy not far away. She seemed to be struck by something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was a beautiful child, but he had a somewhat sallow face as if he were a little malnourished. He looked thinner than the average child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, Grace could see that his features were very delicate. They looked vaguely familiar to hers. It was as though she had seen his face somewhere before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does the child look like a celebrity?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, what surprised her was that the little boy's eyes seemed hollow like a bottomless ice lake. His little face showed no expression as if he knew neither sadness nor happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes and expressions reminded her of the first time she met Jay. He was just like this boy back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... Jay was an adult, after all. This was just a child. It was just that it seemed there was no childlike innocence left in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although the child's eyes gave a hollow feeling, he seemed to be listening to the little girl very carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As the two children were close to the other side of the fence, Grace unconsciously moved her feet toward them from outside the fence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, she heard the two children saying...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mason, are you sure you don't want to play? It's fun. Look, everyone's playing. Let's play too, shall we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy was still silent, looking at the little girl without moving.</p></div>
