        <h1>Chapter 3277</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she looked up, she met his burning gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, his eyes were no longer clear as usual, but replaced by a different kind of radiance. And she naturally understood what that meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face suddenly turned red, biting her lip and feeling a bit overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she didn't know that this expression of hers was even more fatally attractive to him, making him unable to resist his feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian leaned over and kissed Valda's cheek, kissing her rosy face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's body trembled slightly, and her cheeks became even redder. "Brian..." she murmured, her voice like a greater temptation to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm here," he said, continuing to shower her with kisses on her cheeks, forehead, eyebrows, nose, lips... and then lingering on her neck, following her jawline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt a burning sensation where he had kissed her, and her body temperature seemed to be rising. All the blood in her body rushed towards the places where he had kissed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His kiss left her feeling confused and enchanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As his kisses moved downwards, she felt a chill in her chest, and he had already kissed her collarbone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a sudden shiver, she snapped back to reality. "Brian...I...I can't right now..." she stammered, reminding him that she was pregnant. Although the doctor hadn't explicitly forbidden it, the pregnancy was still in its early stages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was panting and stopped moving, but his face remained buried in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, he murmured, "I know." He used to think he had good self-control, like with the women he had been with before. Even if they were his girlfriends, he only had simple physical contact with them and never kissed them, let alone anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when he faced her, he realized that his ability to restrain himself could crumble so quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he knew she was pregnant and certain things were off-limits, he couldn't help but do them anyway. As a result, his self-control was almost completely lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda shifted her body slightly and said, "Um..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't move," he suddenly ordered, "Don't move, otherwise... I'm afraid I'll lose control." These words were spoken with great difficulty from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda immediately became nervous and froze in place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, his gasping finally subsided, and he slowly lifted his head. In his phoenix-like eyes, some clarity seemed to have returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His forehead was covered in a thin layer of sweat, and there was some unusual redness on his cheeks.</p></div>
