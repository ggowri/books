        <h1>Chapter 523</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a little stuffy in here, Sean. Accompany me to the back garden for some air," said Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." A complicated expression was Sean&rsquo;s face as he looked at his fiancee. "You stopped me from speaking because you wanted to do that?" He asked in a soft voice so only she could hear him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. There's no point in warning someone who has a death wish." Smiling, Lily said, "Besides, other than us, there are people who would offend Jason and do much more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean looked at the smile on the corner of his fiancee's lips and suddenly felt an indescribable sense of loss. It was as if he had lost something that he could never get back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, all he could do was firmly attach himself to the woman in front of him for the sake of their families!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not far away, someone looked on coldly as the drama unfolded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian watched with cold eyes as the three women continued to accuse each other. He threw his head back and finished the wine in his glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments ago, he had tried to step forward and stop the three women when he saw Grace being laughed at in public. However, before he could step forward, Jason had already stepped forward to help Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did Brian realize that he seemed to be acting unnecessarily once more. Grace had Jason to protect her, so he did not have to worry about her at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, Jason would deal with those who laughed at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he had already decided to not fight over her with Jason. Brian lowered his eyes, and the corner of his mouth displayed a hint of self-mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn who was standing beside him could not help but call out, "Brian..." It seemed as if he was beginning to stray further and further away from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Or to be frank, he had never been close to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go home. It's boring here," Brian said lightly and headed straight for the banquet's exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Evelyn was taken aback. Nevertheless, she hurried after him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked out of the banquet hall with Grace in his arms. "Put me down. I can walk on my own," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want me to put you down?" Jason asked; his head was lowered, and he was looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace answered after biting her lip a little. After all, him holding her like that was attracting too much attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right." Jason put Grace down as she wished. Then, he called the driver who was waiting at the parking lot to pick them up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was quiet outside the banquet hall and not as lively as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I shouldn't have left just now. You had to go through all that," muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing." Grace smiled. "After all, some things have happened and there's nothing you can do to change them. It's a fact that I've been to prison. Even if they hadn&rsquo;t mentioned it today, someone will surely mention it someday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, as long as Grace stayed by Jason's side, such things would be revealed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only had to face those few people that day. Many more people of the same kind would appear in the future.</p></div>
