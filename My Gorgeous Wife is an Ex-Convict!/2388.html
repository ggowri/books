        <h1>Chapter 2386</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's one more thing I hope you can do for me if it's convenient, Mr. Barlow," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh? I wonder what I can do to help you, Mrs. Reed?" Philip Barlow asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wonder how much you know about the heiress of the Mitchell family getting sent to a mental hospital, Mr. Barlow," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow's eyes narrowed slightly. "What's the matter? Are you interested in this matter, Mrs. Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I have a close friend who the heiress of the Mitchell family had once saved before, so she&rsquo;s considered a friend of a friend. If I have anything that needs to be done in Deer City, I hope you can help us, Mr. Barlow. The Reed family will return the favor in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow smiled. "Speaking of which, I owe the Reed family a favor. If the Reed family hadn't taken care of William during that period, maybe he would have suffered more before I found him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Philip Barlow said, "I don't know much about the heiress of the Mitchell family. I only know what was in the news at the time. Of course, I heard that the Mitchell family was afraid that the heiress would fight for power, so they claimed that the heiress was ill and sent her to a mental hospital even when she was not. Besides that, the heiress' own father and fianc&eacute; believed she was mentally ill. There were diagnosis reports from well-known experts as well. Hence, the voices of doubt soon died down. It seems that the heiress has been in the mental hospital ever since."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yes, she has spent eight years in the mental hospital. Do you know about George Gregory's relationship with Amber Mitchell, the heiress of the Mitchell family? From what I know, the Gregory family also has some business dealings with the Barlow family, and it seems that you and George Gregory were once schoolmates."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow said, "He's my junior. At least, in my opinion, he and the heiress of the Mitchell family were a sweet couple! He probably loved that woman. He never cared that she had gone to prison, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But when she did get out of prison, he wanted to break off the marriage for unknown reasons. That's all I know," said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Thank you. I got more information than I expected. I gotta go. I'll visit another day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace left, Philip Barlow closed his eyes slightly. "The Mitchell family... Amber Mitchell..." Speaking of which, the name had not been mentioned in Deer City for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the name that used to be well-regarded had been forgotten in the river of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He remembered that George Gregory was drunk in a private room in a nightclub the night he talked about breaking off their marriage. He happened to pass by, so he decided to do a good deed and take him home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory hugged him and cried, "Why... Why are you doing this to me? Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It confused him until he heard his mouth vaguely uttering the words &lsquo;Amber Mitchell&rsquo;. He then realized that George Gregory was not talking to him but thought he was Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amby... I... I don't want to do this anymore... If you can't give me all your love, then... I'd rather not have any! I, George Gregory, can&rsquo;t marry you. Even though we're engaged, I can... break off this engagement!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man was reeking with the smell of alcohol, but his voice was choking as he laughed and cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew how proud his junior was. He had always been privileged. The only time he let go of his pride was for Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was said that George Gregory fell in love with Amber Mitchell at first sight and pursued her passionately. He did not care even though she had been to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were supposed to get married a month later, but Amber Mitchell was sent to a mental hospital. George Gregory was indifferent to that and even married Amber Mitchell's stepsister, Louise Mitchell, three months later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It looks like there might be another storm in Deer City," Philip Barlow said quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nothing hurt more than &lsquo;love&rsquo;, so he would not get hurt if he did not fall in love with anyone!</p></div>
