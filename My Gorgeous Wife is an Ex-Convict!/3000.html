        <h1>Chapter 2998</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Linda smiled as she raised her lips, feeling happy as Valda was being belittled. She was curious to see what else Valda could use against Joe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a tall figure approached Valda, and a clear and elegant voice spoke up, "Sorry for keeping you waiting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fortunately, it hasn't been too long," Valda looked at the slight sweat on Brian's forehead, "Did you run over here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was afraid you were waiting impatiently, so I ran a short distance," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took out a tissue and wiped the thin sweat on his forehead, causing a gasp from those around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only the students from the manga club, but also the other students in this room, especially the girls, are now looking at Brian with starry eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wow, Valda, he's so handsome. Is he your boyfriend?" someone asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, he's my boyfriend," Valda admitted gracefully, putting away the tissue after wiping the thin sweat off his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the people around heard it, they became even more envious of Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I envy Valda so much for finding such a handsome boyfriend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's even more handsome than the most handsome guy in our school!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's like a comic book hero come to life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I had such a handsome boyfriend, I wouldn't get tired of drawing him every day!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Linda listened to the envy around her, she suddenly felt uneasy, especially when she saw Valda's boyfriend who was much more handsome than Fynn. This thought made her feel even more resentful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why does Valda get to have such a great boyfriend? Even her sidekick Taylah is looking at Valda's boyfriend with admiration!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, aren't you going to introduce your boyfriend?" Linda asked. "But you know, I've always thought that a man's appearance isn't important. What's important is talent. Sometimes, if a man is too good-looking, you might not be able to handle it. Especially for women who are not as good-looking, they may become less confident and suspicious all the time. Fynn, remember the movie you told me about last time? It seemed to be about an ugly woman who found a handsome young man. It was quite interesting. Why don't you tell us about it and let everyone listen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Linda smiled and sarcastically remarked that Valda was an ugly woman and Brian was a pretty boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was waiting for Fynn to tell the story in public, using it to completely humiliate Valda and her boyfriend. However, what she didn't notice was that at this moment, Fynn was staring at Brian with wide eyes, his face full of astonishment.</p></div>
