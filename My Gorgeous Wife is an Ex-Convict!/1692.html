        <h1>Chapter 1690</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How did this happen... This recording...' She had expected this matter to be kept a secret forever, but everyone heard it on such an occasion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, Irene Lynch's eyes met a pair of deep yet cold and grim eyes a dozen meters away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That's... Jason's eyes!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch had always wanted Jason to look at her, but now she just wished Jason would not do that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She felt chilly when he looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The look in his eyes was almost murderous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The staff members standing next to Irene Lynch moved to film Irene Lynch after filming Damian Harmon just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was at this moment that she realized something. She was doing&hellip; a livestream, which meant all of her fans were watching what was going on right now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Lynch&hellip; Are you the one in the recording?&rdquo; asked the staff member who was pointing the phone&rsquo;s camera at Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, anyone who was familiar with Irene Lynch could tell that it was her voice. The fans watching the livestream were also arguing about whether or not she was the one in the recording.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No... No, it's all a misunderstanding. I don't know what's going on. It's not me. It's not me!" Irene Lynch said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon instantly panicked when he heard this. He yelled at Irene Lynch, "Why are you saying it isn&rsquo;t you? It was you! You told me to do all this! Police, arrest her if you want! It's none of my business! I'm a victim too. She conned me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"N-Nonsense!" Irene Lynch's face went red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How is it nonsense? You also said that once we humiliate Grace, Jason will kick her out of the Reed family and you&rsquo;ll become the mistress of the Reed family!" Damian Harmon blurted out, just wanting to involve Irene Lynch in this and push the blame to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch's face went red. "That's... That's slander." Then, she ran over to Jason. "Young master Reed, I&rsquo;m being framed. It really isn't me. I... I don't know who's trying to frame me. Perhaps I&rsquo;ve offended a lot of people, so it's inevitable that some people don't like me and want to mess with me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is that so?" Jason looked coldly at the person in front of him. "We'll find out whether you were framed once you get to the police station..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's voice was so soft that only Irene Lynch could hear him. "Whoever wants to harm Grace should be prepared to die, understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch almost went limp at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Next, they found out the truth about the photos. The experts and police announced their findings on the spot... All of them were photoshopped. One could find the same photos online, just with different faces!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One could say that Grace had completely cleared her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, what dumbfounded her was not getting her name cleared but that the biggest contribution to achieving this&hellip; was her son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When that phone recording was suddenly played, she thought one of Jay's experts had gotten it, but it turned out... She saw her son holding a laptop and looking like he had successfully accomplished something while her daughter was cheering for him. "Brother, you're amazing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace stepped forward and asked her son what he was doing, her daughter told her how they got the recording before her son could answer.</p></div>
