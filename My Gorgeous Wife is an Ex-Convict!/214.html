        <h1>Chapter 213</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was not stealing or robbing, she was only using labor to make money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to be an extra, why didn't you ask me then? I might even get you a few lines. You&rsquo;ll make more money than being an extra." As Evelyn said this, she deliberately raised her hand and stroked her hair to show off the fancy watch on her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found Evelyn's action a little funny. "I don't think I&rsquo;ll trick my older sister into being an escort just to have a few more lines."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Evelyn's expression changed, knowing that Grace was mocking her for tricking her into escorting her assistant director. However, she seemed to immediately think of something. As she looked at Grace, she said, "Are you so short of money that you need to be an extra? Didn't anyone give you any money? You have to earn this kind of hard money now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not obliged to tell you." Grace did not bother to talk to Evelyn. She directly walked past her and headed toward the place where extras were waiting for their turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn frowned and hesitated for a moment, then ordered the assistant beside her, "Check out that girl named Grace just now. What exactly is going on with her? How much does the person who introduced her to work here know about her? Find out everything. The more detailed, the better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was something going on between Jason and Grace? Evelyn speculated but was uncertain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the woman she saw Jason carrying to the car was really Grace, then there was no need for Grace to be an extra. Grace was not someone keen on show business. If she lacked money, she could just ask Jason for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, how much could an extra earn?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Evelyn was having her makeup done, her assistant finally came back with the information and reported to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? She's still working at the Sanitation Service Center? It was also a street cleaner from the Sanitation Service Center who introduced her here?" Evelyn said in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, and Sidney said, according to the person who introduced her to work here, she was short of money and wanted to make some extra money or something," the assistant replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn seemed to finally put down her heavy burden when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the look of things, Grace was not with Jason. Or rather, even if Grace had been with Jason once before, the two were clearly broken up now and no longer on good terms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, Grace would not need to be an extra to make money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Earlier, she had been really worried that something was going on between Grace and Jason. If nothing was going on between them, then she did not have to worry anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered how she had lost her opportunity to be the leading lady and was forced to become a C-list actress all because Grace got sent to jail. She wanted to get a role, so she asked Grace to accompany the assistant director, but in the end, she was slapped by the assistant director.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her journey to stardom got even more miserable after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she hoped that Grace could help her get a better role from her ex-boyfriend, Sean. However, Grace refused her with a straight face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace just had to put down her pride for a moment and ask Sean to change her younger sister's destiny, but Grace refused to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had not met Brian afterward, Evelyn would never have been able to turn her life around.</p></div>
