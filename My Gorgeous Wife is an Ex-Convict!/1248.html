        <h1>Chapter 1247</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she quickly fell asleep this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason slowly opened his eyes and looked at the woman lying beside him. Her even breathing let him know that she had fallen asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not possibly know what it had taken of his will to stop her hand the moment she tried to touch his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid he would no longer be able to suppress his desire for her once she touched his chest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the one who wanted her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor's risk assessment report still recommended a pregnancy reduction which was relatively safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the assessment report did not entirely condemn any of the triplets to death. The doctor also gave them a solution if they wanted to ensure the smooth labor of the triplets. However, this had a relatively higher risk. At the same time, it would cause substantial damage to Grace's body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The most serious thing was&hellip; "Your uterus could be in danger if you take the risk of giving birth to triplets like this. It's easy to bleed heavily during labor. Your uterus will be removed if the bleeding doesn't stop in a short time. Do you still want to risk it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expert spoke bluntly. After all, for a woman, the uterus was more than just to give birth to children. Once they lose their uterus, they would be infertile and even age prematurely. They might even require long-term medication in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace said without hesitation, "No problem. I can risk it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face was grave, and he coldly spat out four words, "Do the pregnancy reduction!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" Grace subconsciously grabbed Jason's hand. "Give me a chance, and give the babies a chance, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands were now cold with sweat, and she was holding him with a strong panicked grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her almond-shaped eyes had hope, persistence, and even... unswerving determination!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like she would do anything for the babies in her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly felt that if he refused her request now and continued to insist on the pregnancy reduction, then perhaps he might never be able to get into her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do I... still want to get into her heart?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Grace bit her lip and put his hand on her belly. Although her belly was still flat, there were indeed three small lives in there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're their daddy too, aren't you? Once they're born, you'll accompany them as they grow up. If we proceed with the pregnancy reduction, it wouldn't be fair to that one baby, would it? No one in this world should sacrifice themselves for someone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The three babies are doing well right now, and there's nothing wrong with them. I'm reluctant to have a pregnancy reduction, and so are they.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I wouldn't joke with my life. If my body can't take it or if there's something else that's wrong with the babies, I'll take the doctor's best advice. But right now, I want to give myself and the babies a chance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace spoke word by word, but her soft voice was unusually firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason could only feel his palm burning. 'The three babies are growing in her belly. They're... our children!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not care about the babies, but he had some expectations for the unborn babies because Grace was their mother. However, these expectations were small compared to her safety.</p></div>
