        <h1>Chapter 596</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to hear her voice because hearing her voice would reassure him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A moment later, the call was answered, but what came through was a voice Jason had not thought of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was... Brian's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's heart sank immediately. Almost mechanically, he said, "It's me. Why are you answering Grace's phone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's changing her clothes. Her phone and bag are outside... Shall I tell her to call you back later?" Brian's voice said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right." Jason ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call was over, Brian lowered his eyes and looked at the phone in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just now, after seeing the caller ID on Grace's phone spelling out &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;, he answered the call as if he was momentarily possessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Usually, he would never answer someone else's phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... He had done that just now. Was it because it was Jason who called?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man who he previously thought would never fall in love with any woman, fell in love with a woman he was also interested in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the end, he chose to let go. It was not because he was afraid to compete against Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because the person he really wanted was not Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, having said that, every time he saw Grace, he could not help being attracted to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gradually, her voice and face appeared in his mind more and more. Every time he looked at the bracelet, he could not help thinking about her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like... He was bewitched!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian laughed bitterly at this and put his hand to his forehead. What was wrong with him? He knew this woman belonged to Jason, but he could not help getting close to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door to the changing room opened and Grace walked out, dressed in a floral dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's pupils immediately constricted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had not minded it when Grace first picked up the dress earlier, but now that she was dressed in it, it was as if he was looking at the same little girl from his past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That little girl had worn a floral dress while she carried him down the hill with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thorns along the way cut quite a few holes in her dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew she treasured the dress. She said it was a gift from her grandmother, so he told her he would buy her lots and lots of beautiful dresses in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the years, when he saw beautiful dresses, he would buy them and put them away. He hoped that one day, he would give them to her when he found her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After so many years, there were so many dresses that he had to buy a separate apartment just to keep the ones he bought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From his childhood to adulthood, he had been buying dresses for her. He would even buy all sizes of the same dress for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time he bought a new dress, he would go to the apartment and put it away himself.</p></div>
