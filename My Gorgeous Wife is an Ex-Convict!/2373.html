        <h1>Chapter 2371</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why would you be my lawyer?" she asked at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because Kyla says she wants to find out where her friend is, and you&rsquo;ll only tell her on the condition that you get off on probation and are released,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, are you going to help her? A lawyer like you wouldn't be doing this for money, would you?" Jacqueline Bowman said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm only doing this for my friend," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're the mistress of the Reed family. Many people in Emerald City would love to lick your boots. How does someone like Kyla deserve to be your friend? She's only a store owner! Don't you find it beneath you to be friends with someone like her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If that's your opinion on friends, you won't have any true friends. Kyla helped me when I was down and out. How can I abandon her when she didn&rsquo;t abandon me back then? Jacqueline Bowman, even if you didn't become friends with Kyla, Kyla would have remembered your kindness forever. But... you're too impatient," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman understood what Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was too eager to make use of Kyla's kindness so that she could benefit from it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had not been impatient, Kyla would certainly have helped her by asking Martin Weiss or the Reed family for help if she got into trouble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how Kyla would stop at nothing to find Martin Weiss and the Reed family to get Amber Mitchell's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she realized this too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trial lasted for two days, and Jacqueline Bowman did whatever Grace told her to do, rejecting most of the evidence against her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss and Kyla appeared in court, Jacqueline Bowman felt the jealousy washing over her again. She had learned from the police the extent of Martin Weiss's sacrifice for Kyla and how badly injured he was from saving her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How did Kyla get such a brilliant man to sacrifice so much for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It made Jacqueline Bowman feel even more unlucky. She had been with Neal Reid for so many years, yet she still ended up like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the trial, Mr. Lambert shouted as soon as Martin Weiss and Kyla came out, "Mr. Weiss and Miss Corbyn, this is all that bitch Jacqueline Bowman's idea. I was tricked! I'm a victim too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the judge ordered him to be quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss and Kyla left the courtroom after giving their testimony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they did not really leave but just went to a room not far from the courtroom. It was full of digital screens of different sizes, showing the courtroom from various angles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sat in the room watching the trial while a famous lawyer in Emerald City stood beside Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss came over, Jason smiled. "Thank you. Consider it a rehearsal for the real trial."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We should thank you, Mr. Reed. You've made such a brilliant arrangement," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman and Mr. Lambert had no idea that the trial was just for show. It was merely to trick them into thinking it was a real trial.</p></div>
