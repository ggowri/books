        <h1>Chapter 1035</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day after work, Lina came to see Grace. They found a diner and ordered food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did anything happen between you and Jason yesterday? Did he give you any trouble?" Lina asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated a little before saying, "He wants to start over with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Lina was surprised, her eyes widening in surprise. "Start over? Do you mean... getting back together as a couple?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately gritted her teeth. "Jason... has no shame at all. He was the one who wanted to break up, and now he wants to get together with you? Isn't this torture?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was the only one in Emerald City who dared to call Jason shameless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was amused by her best friend's expression and became less depressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It can be torture," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you say yes?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head. "No, there's no way we can get back together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the waiter served their food. Grace lowered her head and began to eat in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's expression had changed from indignation to hesitation. "Grace, have you gotten over Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, Grace was so sad and distressed when Jason broke up with her. Could she have gotten over Jason in just a few months?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," Grace replied softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did Jason give you a hard time?" Lina asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not yet," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now&hellip;' Lina was worried about what would happen next. Even if Grace was unwilling, a man like Jason had many ways to force Grace to date him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Alright, don't worry about me! How much more trouble can he give me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had already lost enough, and there was only so much more she could lose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed at the thought. One would become more and more fearless when they lost enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because there was nothing left to lose!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If Jason is giving you a hard time, I'll get Hadwin to come up with some ideas!" said Lina. After all, she did not want to see her best friend suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of Hadwin Stephenson, as if reminded her of something, Grace said, "By the way, can you ask Hadwin Stephenson for a favor and find out if there was someone behind the three thugs who were sent to the police station yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. "Do you suspect that someone intentionally asked those three people to create trouble?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just suspect it," said Grace. She was suspicious because she saw the three thugs showing no fear when they walked into the police station. It was as if they were not worried about what would happen next.</p></div>
