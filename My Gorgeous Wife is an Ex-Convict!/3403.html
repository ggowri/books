        <h1>Chapter 3401</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Grace's worried expression, Jason said, "Okay, don't overthink it. No news is good news, which means Lawrence is likely still alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace sighed, "Yes, Lawrence is very likely still alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I just don't know if Lawrence will ever be able to appear in front of them again in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passes day by day, and the triplets' birthday is naturally a very important event for the Reed family. Jasper is wearing a beautiful white dress, looking like a fairy fallen from the mortal world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the age of 14, one can already be considered a young adult, and this person looks poised and graceful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has long black hair, curved willow leaf eyebrows, and a pair of almond-shaped eyes that look clear and bright. Her delicate face, swan-like neck, and the developing body of a young girl all make her appear to be transitioning from a girl to a young woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at herself in the mirror. Today was her birthday, and she should have been happy, but deep down, there was always a hint of regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How great it would be if Lawrence were here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, she had told Lawrence that if it was her birthday, she wanted him to give her a gift!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But every year, he has never given her a birthday present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door of the room was knocked on, and the makeup artist who was doing Jasper's makeup went to open it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the door stood William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, William walked in. When he saw Jasper, he was momentarily stunned and a bit dizzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In recent years, her facial features have gradually matured and she has become more beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his eyes, she has always been beautiful, whether it was when she was a child or now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although they have been living in different cities for the past few years and haven't met often, they frequently video chat and he often sees her and her various expressions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought he wouldn't be too surprised no matter how she dressed up tonight. But when he actually saw her, his heart couldn't help but contract violently for a moment, as if reminding him of something, and his gaze almost couldn't move away from her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, what's wrong?" Jasper asked as he approached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William snapped out of his thoughts and said, "Nothing...just wanted to ask how you're doing with the preparations for the banquet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm all set. Let's go down together," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," William replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they walked out of the room, William whispered in a voice only they could hear, "You look very beautiful tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," she smiled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... because she's too beautiful, he feels uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's afraid that too many people will come to like her, and he's afraid that he's not strong enough yet to have her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although there's only a few hours' drive between Emerald City and Deer Capital, he still feels it's too far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If... if they could be closer, if they could see each other every day...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That would be so great!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he also understands that the patience he's showing now is all for the future, so that he can be more worthy of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, what do you think our future will be like?" William suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Our future?" Jasper was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, our future." He stopped walking and turned to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At fourteen years old, William is already much taller than Jasper.</p></div>
