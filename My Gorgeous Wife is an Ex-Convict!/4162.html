        <h1>Chapter 4160 Have some snacks</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Adele looked deeply at the woman in front of her, as if she saw her own reflection from years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Back then, she also had the courage to believe that love only required unwavering courage!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But in the end...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Regardless, you would be willing to help him relieve his pain, right?" Adele asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes!" Tina said without any hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Good. Just don't forget the words you said to me today," Adele said, then turned and left, leaving Tina confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> What... did she come to find her just to say these things?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Was it to test whether she was truly committed to Chandler and willing to have his child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After a while, Chandler returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Did you finish paying your respects?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Hmm," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you always have to go to pay respects every time you come back?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "More or less. If I'm staying at the Hunter family, then on Friday nights we would pay respects," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But the person in the portrait didn't harm your family, yet you still insist on paying respects to her?" Tina asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's said to appease her anger, and over time, it became a tradition for the Hunter family," Chandler replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "When you're paying respects, do you ever secretly curse the person in the portrait?" After all, it was because of this woman that he was in so much pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I used to, but not anymore," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why not anymore?" she asked, curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He looked at her with tender eyes, "If the parasites didn't exist in my body, then I wouldn't have met you. I wouldn't have noticed your existence when I saw Lina, I wouldn't have saved you, and I wouldn't have known that you are such a lovely person worth loving!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So, gradually, his mindset started to change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Before she was born, he would complain about the unfairness of fate. Every time the pain in his body flared up, he would resent why he had to have such a body, why such a curse had to exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But later, as she spent more time with him, he even began to feel fortunate that fate bound him to this curse, connecting his destiny with Tina's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Suddenly, Tina felt her heart race. Facing the gaze of the man in front of her, she had an urge to forcefully press him down beneath her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, before she could act on this impulse, the sound of a knock interrupted them. This time, it was the maid delivering late-night snacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Madam asked to send some late-night snacks for the young master and Miss Stephenson," the maid said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm feeling a bit hungry," Tina quickly said, trying to divert her attention. Thankfully, she didn't really lay a hand on Chandler earlier, otherwise she would've been caught red-handed by the servant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even though she had a thick skin, being in the man's house made it inappropriate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Just put it down," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes!" The servant placed the tray of food on the coffee table in the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Once the servant left, Tina started enjoying the snacks. She had to admit, the Hunter family's snacks were indeed delicious! She couldn't help but want to have another one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you like them?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Mm, they're quite tasty," Tina replied, picking up another one and offering it to Chandler's lips, clearly intending to feed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler raised an eyebrow slightly. He didn't really like the snacks at home, but at this moment, he obediently opened his mouth and took a bite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just as he was about to take another bite, Tina suddenly trembled and dropped the snack on the floor, accompanied by a moan from her mouth...</p></div>
