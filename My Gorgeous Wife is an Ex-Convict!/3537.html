        <h1>Chapter 3535</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica got on the car and saw Grace sitting in the back seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Auntie Grace," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard you've been living alone in your old house lately?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let me take you there," Grace said, instructing the driver in the front seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car slowly drove away from the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you want to leave home and live in the old house?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I feel it's quieter over there. Besides, I'm already grown up now. Even if I live alone, it's okay. And when my mom passed away, she left me a bank account with some money in it, so my life won't be a problem," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace looked at the girl in front of her and felt like she had changed again, as if she had grown up a lot overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, sometimes a person's sudden growth is often accompanied by hardships and pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this thought, Grace felt even more heartbroken for the girl in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Arriving at Veronica's place, Grace looked around the old house. It was a 60-square-meter house with two bedrooms and a living room. It was not bad for one person to live in, but the decoration inside the house was over a decade old and quite outdated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, I came to see you today to tell you that even though Mason is not with you now, I am still your Auntie Grace. If you have any difficulties, don't hesitate to come to me," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned for a moment, looking at Grace in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace rubbed Veronica's head and said, "I am grateful for your protection of Mason in the past. I didn't expect him to go abroad for hypnosis, but now... Anyway, I hope you are doing well. If you need me to intervene in your relationship with your family, just let me know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need," Veronica interrupted Grace, "I know that my father and stepmother have done many bad things under the name of the Reed family. They have caused a lot of damage to the reputation of the Reed family. So, the Reed family doesn't need to do anything for the Barlow family anymore. And now that I have moved out, I don't want to go back to that house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica paused and said seriously, "Auntie Grace, I also want to change my life and try to be independent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the seriousness in Veronica's eyes, Grace sighed, "Okay, but you have to promise me that if you have any difficulties, you will come to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," Veronica nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two chatted for a while longer, and just as Grace was about to leave, Veronica suddenly asked, "Auntie Grace, how is Mason doing now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace hesitated for a moment, then slowly replied, "Same as before, I rarely talk or converse with people. But he plans to go to a foreign school after graduating from high school."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? Well, it's understandable since he has strong academic abilities. It's only natural for him to attend a prestigious foreign school," Veronica tried hard to put a smile on her face, but at this moment, her throat was bitterly tight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tap! Tap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears slid down her cheeks, she didn't know when they started.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pain spread from her chest to her whole body, silently telling her that the distance between her and him would only grow larger in the future!</p></div>
