        <h1>Chapter 3416</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Love?" Mason's eyes narrowed slightly, and the hostility emanating from him became even more apparent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, we're interested in your sister, Daniel," the guy next to Daniel joked, nudging him with his elbow and winking suggestively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel looked at Mason and said, "Are you Veronica's brother? Hi, my name is Daniel, and I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel hadn't finished speaking when Mason interrupted angrily, "She won't date you, so you better give up on her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel frowned, while his friend couldn't help but say, "Hey, little brother, what do you mean by that? As a younger brother, do you still want to hinder your sister from dating...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, a "bang" sound of a punch immediately silenced the voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The speaking boy no longer punched Mason to the ground, and there was a sound of exclamation around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing this, Daniel took a quick step forward and said to Mason, "How could you just hit someone like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason simply said with cold eyes, "Because he said something I didn't want to hear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So you can't hit people either!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hit me, so what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy who was knocked down by Mason is now groaning and holding his stomach, unable to stand up. This shows how powerful Mason's punch was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A group of men on Daniel's side were clearly angered by Mason's attitude and immediately threw punches at him, causing chaos on the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel initially thought about intervening and trying to stop the fight. He considered that since he had more people on his side and his friends were skilled, he was afraid they might hurt Mason too badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it was unexpected that Mason alone was able to beat up Daniel's friends so badly that they couldn't fight back. In the end, even Daniel himself was knocked down by Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mason's fist landed on him, he realized that he had underestimated this younger student. The way he attacked was at a professional level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Mason's fist was about to hit Daniel again, Veronica suddenly rushed over and stood directly in front of Daniel to block the blow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's fist abruptly halted just before it was about to collide with Veronica's, and his dark eyes remained fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica gasped for breath and glared at Mason. "Mason, please stop hitting him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason pursed his thin lips and asked, "Are you protecting him?" His tone was calm, but there was an indescribable sense of danger in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The surroundings were quiet, except for the cries of the few people lying on the ground. No one dared to speak up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "You shouldn't hit people!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them locked eyes, and there was a tense feeling in the air. Suddenly, Mason lifted his hand and pulled Veronica towards the classroom door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, Mason, let go... let go!" Veronica shouted, but Mason didn't loosen his grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stumbled along with Mason out of the classroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until the two of them were far away that someone finally spoke up in the classroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, Mason seemed really angry just now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've never seen Mason get mad at Veronica before!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you think there's something strange between them? They don't seem like siblings at all. If you didn't know, you'd think Mason was her boyfriend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't they say that Veronica's family climbed up the ranks thanks to Mason and the Reed family? Who knows what they're really doing behind the scenes, pretending to be siblings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some hurtful words kept coming out of people's mouths.</p></div>
