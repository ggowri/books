        <h1>Chapter 1313</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But why is Master Reed sitting in a place like this? It's... a pregnancy class! Is Master Reed here for the lecture?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The heir's eyes kept blinking as he tried to make sure what he was seeing was real or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's come over you? Why are your eyes twitching so much?" the heir's wife asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No-Nothing!" the heir said quickly. He was indeed twitching! Few people could probably stay calm in such a situation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The heir quickly grabbed his wife, walked to the seat behind Jason, and sat down. Then, he took a closer look at him and found that... the man really seemed to be Master Reed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that Master Reed had come to the class with the woman next to him who was wearing a loose, light-colored outfit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That woman... should be pregnant, right? Who is she to Master Reed? A relative? It can't be his wife!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The internet would&rsquo;ve blown up if Master Reed had gotten married!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had also brought a notepad, planning to write some notes down if the teacher said anything important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason could not help laughing when he saw how serious she looked as she listened attentively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you didn't catch on to some points, I'll have someone come to the house and give you another lesson," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's different. It's not the same atmosphere having classes at home alone," said Grace. There were so many pregnant women here that it was also a novel experience for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" asked Jason. Although he did not find anything good about the atmosphere here, he would accompany her to future classes if she enjoyed it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was time to start, the specialist giving the lecture came into the conference room and was stunned when they saw Jason there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the specialist was not Grace's attending doctor, they had once participated in Grace's consultation, so they naturally knew Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Master Reed is attending my lecture?' The specialist was immediately shocked! She never expected Emerald City's renowned Master Reed to accompany his wife to such a class.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rumor had it that Master Reed had no interest in women. Back when his fianc&eacute;e died, he did not even shed a tear and was expressionless! She thought that such a man was probably cold-blooded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the specialist now thought that Master Reed had the tendency to become a wife-doting fanatic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the specialist started lecturing, Grace listened attentively and took notes from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the things the specialist mentioned could be found in pregnancy books, but others were a summary of the specialist's experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After talking about some of the things that pregnant women needed to know, the specialist moved on to some basic issues about baby care. Then, she said to the crowd, "Would any expectant father be willing to demonstrate how to hold a baby? Just do as I say. I'll see if all you expectant fathers got it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">None of the expectant fathers there came forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the nurse nearby helped the specialist shout and an expectant father finally raised his hand. He came to the front of the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's get one more expectant father. We'll let two expectant fathers demonstrate," the specialist said.</p></div>
