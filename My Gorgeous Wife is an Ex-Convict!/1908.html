        <h1>Chapter 1906</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, why are you doing this to me? Even if I separated you and Lina, I helped you get back the Stephenson family. Isn't that enough?" she asked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He just looked at her coldly as if she were a pest to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you being so cruel to the Jackson family and me just for Lina? But aren't you separated from her now? She's unworthy of your love, isn't she? You did so much for her, but what about her? What has she done for you? She doesn&rsquo;t believe in you, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, his men pressed her to the ground. Her cheek was pressed against the cold rough ground. She looked like a mess and was embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked condescendingly at her with a fearsome chill in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Katherine Jackson, if you mention Lina in front of me again, I&rsquo;ll really kill you!" Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if those words were taboo for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Katherine Jackson, it's simple. It&rsquo;s the law of the jungle. I was weak, and you were strong, so I had to do everything you wanted. Now, I'm strong, and you're weak, so you have to suffer. I&rsquo;ll never let go of anyone who hurt me," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At that moment, Katherine Jackson only felt enveloped by jealousy. Compared to her hatred for Hadwin Stephenson, she hated Lina more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson never let go of anyone who hurt him, but Lina was the only one who could still enjoy her life and even get pregnant with Hadwin Stephenson's child after hurting him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Who is Lina to have that? How is this woman better than me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson said coldly, "I spent a bomb on hiring these men. They're cold-blooded mercenaries. They know nothing about being gentle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She gave the man standing beside Lina a look as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That man immediately raised his hand to slap Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's cheek swelled up instantly, and Katherine Jackson was smug. "Lina, I have your life in my hands now. You'll live or die as I wish!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's eyes widened with pain as she said, "Even if I die, you're probably just going to end up in a worse state after the police catch you. Katherine Jackson, I do have some bad blood with you, but not to the point of killing you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina tried her best to calm down. She knew that Katherine Jackson had Grace and her in her hands. She could not trigger her. Besides, she had a baby in her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even though we were rivals in love, I&rsquo;ve already broken up with Hadwin Stephenson and won't have any contact with him. His feelings for me may not be that sincere anyway. Why are you so hell-bent on me?"</p></div>
