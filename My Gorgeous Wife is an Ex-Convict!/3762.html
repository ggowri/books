        <h1>Chapter 3760</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm serious," Mason's voice suddenly sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley breathed a sigh of relief at his words and smiled, "That's good. I rarely come to such a good restaurant. There are so many things I want to eat! I won't be polite and order a lot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at Mason in surprise. She didn't expect him to actually answer. Because of his response, she felt a sweet feeling in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing their meal, Shirley took the initiative to leave first, saying that her job as a third wheel was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about you? Are you going home now or doing something else?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go home? It seems a bit early now." Veronica looked at the time and said, "How about we take a walk and digest a bit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." He agreed without any objection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two walked along the road, and the gentle night breeze brushed their cheeks, making her feel very comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walking with him like this, it felt like a kind of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, your school's campus festival is in two days, right? What time should I come to find you?" She asked. She had previously said that she would go to Stanford University to see their campus festival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anytime after 9am. I'll come to pick you up and we'll go together." He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, okay." She smiled, realizing it had been years since she had attended a campus festival with him. She felt a bit nostalgic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked, they unconsciously strolled to the pedestrian street in the city center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pedestrian street was crowded at night. Veronica saw a stall selling cotton candy and said, "Wait here, I'll buy some cotton candy. Do you want some?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's too sweet," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but laugh. "But you used to like it when we were kids. Every time I bought cotton candy, you always wanted to share it with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that time, she had very little pocket money, so they only bought one stick of cotton candy and shared it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she remembered something and said, "Oh, but you were hypnotized. The feeling of liking cotton candy when we were kids should also..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was hypnotized only for my feelings towards you, and it only faded, not forgotten. I remember everything from before," Mason said. "But liking something as a child doesn't necessarily mean you'll like it when you grow up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," she murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He liked her when they were kids, and he continued to like her until he was 14. But now, he's grown up, he's 18, and he may not necessarily like her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they are officially dating now, why does she still feel uneasy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After buying the cotton candy, Veronica took a bite. The soft cotton candy tasted delicious when she was a child, but now that she's grown up, it doesn't seem as tasty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Are you lost in thought looking at the cotton candy?" he asked, his voice ringing in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just feel that things I liked as a child may not necessarily be liked when I grow up," </span><span>she said softly, with a hint of worry between her eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, not liking to see her expression like this, as if she was thinking about something but keeping him out of it.</span></p></div>
