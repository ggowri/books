        <h1>Chapter 1121</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Robert Brewer leered at Stella and said, "It's not that simple! Speaking of which, you look better than before. It seems Brian is willing to spend money on you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want?" Stella asked bitterly. They had already divorced, but Robert Brewer had asked her for money a few days ago. He said that if she did not pay him, he would post her old photos online and let the netizens see what she used to look like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was ugly and unsophisticated in the photos, and some of them were intimate photos she had taken with Robert Brewer in the past!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they were posted online, forget about Brian&rsquo;s reaction upon seeing them, but those photos would also be her skeleton in the closet if she wanted to be a big star.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she had to buy the photos from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought it was over, but Robert Brewer kept showing up and asking for money. He gave only a few photos at a time, unwilling to give her all the photos at one go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That depends on how much you can give me," Robert Brewer spoke like a scoundrel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella hesitated and said, "50 million, then. Give me all the photos in one go. If you dare hold something back, I'm just going to fight you to the death. I'll tell Brian about this. Even if Brian does end up seeing those intimate photos, it would be better than having you extort me all my life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Robert Brewer could not help frowning when he heard this. If they were really going to fight to the death, he would gain nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, 50 million was plenty. At least, it was a figure he had not dared imagine before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, I'll give you all the photos in one go," said Robert Brewer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then go back and wait for me. I'll get the money ready and contact you in a week," said Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Robert Brewer was beaming from ear to ear when he heard that. "Okay, I'll wait for your call. Don't play with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella stomped her foot in hatred after Robert Brewer left! 'This can't go on. I have to get rid of this hidden danger that is Robert Brewer and&hellip;' Stella glanced up at the nearby building where Grace's firm was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she needed to get rid of Robert Brewer and Grace, she might as well do it once and for all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A plan immediately took shape in Stella's mind, and she instantly smiled, thinking that the plan she had just thought of was a good one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she succeeded, she would like to see if Grace dared to show up in front of Brian again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace finished her afternoon work outside and decided to go to Nelson's kindergarten to see the little one as it was still early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, she had not seen Nelson for several days because of various things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace also bought some snacks children this age could eat on the way and planned to give them to Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she arrived at the kindergarten, classes were over and many parents had come to pick up their children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It did not take Grace long to catch sight of Kyla Corbyn. Kyla Corbyn was holding Nelson's hand and standing near the kindergarten&rsquo;s gates. However, to Grace's surprise, Paisley Daniels was standing in front of Kyla Corbyn and Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was Paisley Daniels here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's almond-shaped eyes could not help but narrow!</p></div>
