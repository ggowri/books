        <h1>Chapter 3060</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This Brian is unlike any he has ever seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, do you really love Valda?" Jason murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's body suddenly trembled, and in his phoenix-like eyes, there seemed to be an endless amount of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Love...yes...yes, I love her...I love her so much..." At this moment, he finally spoke clearly and confessed his love for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why am I so foolish? I clearly love her, so why can't I bring myself to admit it? She's been wanting to hear me say 'I love you' all this time! But...when she asked me before, why didn't I say it? Why? Why?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, he intensely hates himself,</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why didn't he have the courage to confirm his love for her back then? Why didn't he speak up at that time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when she was engulfed by the waves, he never said "I love you" once in his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Will she be disappointed? Will she be sad?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Until her death, she thought he had never loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, she won't die, she definitely won't die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, find Valda for me, find her, I want to tell her I love her, I want to tell her..." At this moment, Brian was shouting like a madman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason seemed to see himself back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace fell off the cliff with the car, he almost went crazy with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only those who have experienced it can understand that kind of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But in the end, Grace and the children returned to his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But can Valda still come back to Brian alive?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I love her, I love her, haha... I love her..." Brian was shouting, crying and laughing at the same time, his handsome face twisted in madness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Jason suddenly had a feeling that if Valda was really no longer in this world, then Brian would go crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Become a complete and utter madman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For three consecutive days, Valda was not found. Only a piece of torn cloth from her dress was found downstream on the second day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This piece of fabric, however, is treasured by Brian and he wraps it around his wrist, always carrying it with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the third day, both Phoebe and Whitney were caught.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These two individuals had originally planned to escape to a foreign country and had already made careful arrangements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the end, it was all for naught.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After being arrested, Whitney shifted all the blame onto Phoebe, claiming that she was merely being used and that Phoebe was the mastermind behind everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All the plans were made by Phoebe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Regarding this, Phoebe neither admitted nor denied it. She simply made a request to meet Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She will only confess everything after seeing Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian heard Phoebe's request from the police, he agreed to it.</p></div>
