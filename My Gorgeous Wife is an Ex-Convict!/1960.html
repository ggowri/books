        <h1>Chapter 1958</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he seemed to be so easily manipulated by her that he could not break free!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly shoved the tube of ointment back into Lina's hands. "Apply it yourself!" With that said, he went upstairs and entered his bedroom without waiting for her to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As the door closed with a bang, Hadwin Stephenson leaned on the door while nervously combing through his hair and feeling flustered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Why am I always so helpless in front of her? It's as if I'm willing to let her do whatever she wants.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While having dinner at the Stephenson family&rsquo;s mansion, Lina saw that all the dishes were to her taste. They were Emerald City's local delicacies that she used to like to eat, but a small part of them were J City's special dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not surprising to see J City's cuisine here, but to cook Emerald City's food required a chef familiar with the cuisine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina dug in happily, peeking at Hadwin Stephenson from time to time. In the end, she looked at him blatantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How nice... She could sit beside him and have dinner with him. If only they could be as sweet and happy in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Not only them, but their child would eat with them as well. Then, they would talk about the interesting things that happened every day. It was nice to think of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Of course, it would be better to have more than one child...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina could not help smiling as she thought about it. She looked a little silly with her red and swollen cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson look up at Lina, who had a silly smile on her face. "What's on your mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm wondering how many children we're going to have," Lina blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson froze and then suddenly sneered. "What's the matter? Are you so sure that I'll forgive you and be with you in a month?" Somehow, the thought of how many children they would have did not bother him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina suddenly came to her senses as if he had rained on her parade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm not sure. I'm just... I&rsquo;m just..." Biting her lip, she seemed at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the way she looked, he felt flustered again. "Alright, you don't have to explain. Eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina lowered her head and had two mouthfuls. Suddenly, she seemed to recall something. She looked up and said, "Hadwin, it's going to be your birthday in three days. Can I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No!" He interrupted her before letting her finish. "Lina, you can forget about it if you want me to take you to my birthday party. Who are you attending as? My ex-girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's hands that were holding the chopsticks tightened as her face paled a little. "I... I know. I... I wasn't thinking of going to your birthday party. I just wanted to ask if I could have a cake with you when you come back from your birthday party? I... I'll prepare the cake. I just... I want to wish you a happy birthday and have a slice of birthday cake with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the way she was so humble and meek, Hadwin Stephenson was not the slightest bit happy. All he felt was a stuffy feeling in his chest that made breathing difficult for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Have a slice of birthday cake with me?'</p></div>
