        <h1>Chapter 2968</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So Valda kept her eyes closed and said, "Then... can I sleep a little longer? When you wake me up, can you give me a good morning kiss? That way, when I open my eyes, I'll see you. If this were in a comic book, there would be roses all around your face, and maybe some petals and stars to set the mood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a burst of laughter sounded, followed by a woman's voice saying, "I didn't expect this child to be so funny. How come I didn't notice it last time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda suddenly shuddered and opened her eyes, which were previously closed. She sat up abruptly from the bed and, upon seeing what was in front of her, wished she hadn't woken up yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart are standing in front of the bed, looking at her, while Brian is also on the bed with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, she and Brian were caught in bed by his parents!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda couldn't help but let out a mournful cry in her heart. Okay, ever since the first night she moved in here and slept on the same bed with Brian, they have been sharing the same bed every night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she and Brian didn't do anything and just chatted under the covers, the problem is...if she says that, will his parents believe it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uncle... Auntie... hello..." Valda hesitantly greeted them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Very good, very good," said Mrs. Hart with a smile. "I just like girls who take the initiative. Valda, our Brian has a bit of a cold personality and may not be very proactive in dealing with things. If you take the initiative, it will complement him nicely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked embarrassed and didn't know how to respond for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart addressed Mrs. Hart, "You see, your words might easily scare the child." Then, Mr. Hart turned to Valda and said, "Miss Theller, if you want to sleep, go ahead and sleep. We will be leaving soon, and it won't disturb your rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um, Uncle, just call me Valda. I'm... I'm not sleepy now, so I don't want to sleep," Valda quickly said. Even if she was extremely sleepy before, all drowsiness had been scared away by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, I see. Well, why don't you tidy up and come down to the living room, and we can talk," said Mr. Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, okay. You guys go down first, we'll come in a bit," replied Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. and Mrs. Hart, who are elderly, left the bedroom. Valda suddenly deflated like a balloon and buried her entire face in the covers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wow, did she just embarrass herself big time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong?" Brian's voice sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She trembled and suddenly looked up at him, asking, "When did your parents arrive?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's been a while." Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long is a while?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"About half an hour before you woke up." Brian estimated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Valda suddenly felt speechless. So she had slept for another half an hour after his parents came in?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you wake me up?" She asked. If her phone alarm hadn't gone off, would she have had to continue sleeping?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You seemed to be sleeping well, and besides, it wasn't a big deal that they came in." He said in a casual tone, as if it was just an ordinary matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if I'm sleeping well, you should still wake me up!" Valda wailed. "During that half an hour, I didn't do anything strange or say anything weird in my sleep, did I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, you slept well." He said with a hint of a smile on his lips.</p></div>
