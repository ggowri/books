        <h1>Chapter 319</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As someone who was appearance-obsessed and would love this idol today and love another tomorrow, she was serious about each one of them! </p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was a devoted fan when she was crazy about her idols and even spent money to go to their concerts and autograph sessions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, she would even attend celebrity fan meetings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, most of this happened before Grace's incident. After Grace's incident, she became less starstruck. Besides going to work, she focused all her energy on helping her best friend to reverse her case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, the videos of the concerts, signings, and fan meetings were equivalent to the wonderful memories of her youth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, these memories were now... gone?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened to my idols' event videos?" Lina exclaimed, turning her head to stare at Hadwin who was driving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've deleted them," Hadwin answered quite directly and readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... deleted them?" Lina thought she was going to faint. If he had not returned her phone, she would have to accept the fate of its contents. However, he returned her phone, but her precious videos were gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I deleted them. Even if you took your phone to a professional repair shop, you still wouldn&rsquo;t be able to restore them." He continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt like coughing up blood. "Those are the memories of my youth!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Memories?" He sneered suddenly. Then, he turned the steering wheel and pulled the car over to the roadside. He unbuckled his seat belt and leaned his upper body toward her. "You know what I was thinking when I saw those videos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" His handsome face closed in on her suddenly and made her heart beat much faster. The closer she looked at him, the more she felt that time had treated him well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was two years older than she was, but right now, his face looked like that of a fresh graduate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Youthful and tender!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bah! What was she thinking? Lina hurriedly shook off the chaotic thoughts in her mind and stared at the man in front of her before saying, "You can't just delete people's videos!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He breathed on her face. "I was thinking that I wasn't the only one you said those things to. You seem to say a lot to other men too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." For a moment, she felt speechless because... Come to think of it, it seemed to be true. She seemed to express her love for them a lot in those videos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it not normal for fans to say that they like their idols, love their idols, and were willing to accompany them forever?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, her lifetime with her idols usually lasted for only a few months to a year or so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised his hand and gently played with her fringe. "All right. From now on, you mustn't say that to any other man. You can only say that to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." She tried to argue a little more, but his eyes fixed on her coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't test my patience, Lina. I've already said that from this day on, we're dating. Are you going to tell other men you like or love them? What are you going to do with me as your boyfriend?" He said, his voice so cold compared to his affectionate gestures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment Lina stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She almost forgot that he was not the cutie he was back then. He was Hadwin, the current patriarch of the Stephenson family!</p></div>
