        <h1>Chapter 584</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated and said, "I'm actually quite happy at the small restaurant, and..." She paused and said very seriously, "I want to work on my own, Jay. If I were to work at your company, I won&rsquo;t have to do anything if everyone knows I&rsquo;m your girlfriend. I'll just sit there and get paid every month."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't that great?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to see how far I can go on my own. I don&rsquo;t expect to spend my whole life delivering food. I'm also looking at some research materials in private, hoping it'll help me in my future career," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had begun planning for her future career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly as he heard this. Then, he raised his hand and stroked her swollen cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gasped in slight pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Apply some medicine when you get back. Also, didn't I tell you to call me if there are any problems? Why didn't you call me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">God knew what would have happened if he had not decided to drop by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied somewhat awkwardly, "Uh... I forgot..." After all, it all happened so suddenly. She was in a confrontation with her father and stepmother. At that moment, she forgot to call him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes flickered slightly. 'Does this mean that in her heart, I&rsquo;m still not the first person she wants to rely on when she's in trouble?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must remember to ask me for help if you get into any trouble in the future. Don't you forget it again!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, got it!" she replied, feeling a surge of warmth in her heart. "By the way, you didn&rsquo;t need to slap my stepmother a second time. You'll get into trouble if she tries to sue you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let her sue me," Jason said without a care in the world. He wanted people to understand that if they want to touch her, they should be prepared for him to touch them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did your father and stepmother bother you today?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe they think I have something to do with Evelyn and Brian's breakup." Grace found it ridiculous as she spoke of it. "Or maybe they just want to find a scapegoat to blow off some steam and make them feel that Evelyn's break up with Brian isn&rsquo;t Evelyn's problem but someone else's."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Jason's eyes darkened a little. "Don't they know whose girlfriend you are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think they should know by now," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back at Reed Residence, Jason took out the first-aid kit and applied the medicine for Grace. "Do you want me to deal with your father and stepmother?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had one of them not been her biological father, he would not have asked this. He would have just left those two homeless and helpless in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Forget it. There's no need for that. I think they dare not bother me anymore after today," said Grace, yawning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was exhausted after today's commotion. She was already sleepy when it was only eight o 'clock in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should turn in early," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace nodded and lied on the bed, falling asleep in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sat on the bedside, staring deeply at the sleeping face of the person before him. After a moment, he stood up, went downstairs, and made a call. "Where are you? I want to see you now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was making tea alone in the huge private room of a club owned by the Hart family. The wall on one side was made from special glass that was transparent from the inside, but when one looked from the outside, it was opaque.</p></div>
