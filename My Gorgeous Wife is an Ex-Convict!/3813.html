        <h1>Chapter 3811</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the day had dawned. Veronica tightly gripped the shoe heel with the nail in her hand, grinding the rope on her back with the nail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she couldn't see behind her, she could feel the rope slowly wearing away. She had been bound like this for a whole night, and her strength was almost depleted. She was relying solely on her willpower now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to make the rope break quickly and escape before the building was demolished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crack!" Suddenly, she gasped for air. While grinding the rope with the nail, she had once again stabbed her hand with the shoe heel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand had been pricked by the nail countless times during the night while grinding the rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her left hand gets tired, she switches to her right hand to continue grinding the rope. When her right hand gets tired, she switches back to her left hand. As a result, both of her hands have many wounds from the thorns, and some of the deeper wounds are bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it is also because of the pain from these wounds that her body is less tired and drowsy, allowing her to stay alert until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's almost there. She can feel that the rope in her hand is about to break!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, she suddenly heard a voice outside, "Check it out. If there's no problem, we'll blow it up and demolish it later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blow it up and demolish it? Veronica was startled, feeling even more pressed for time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And how long is "later" that the person mentioned?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if someone checks it, does that mean that if the person sees her like this later, she will be saved?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the door of the auditorium was pushed open. Veronica shuddered and looked towards the door with anticipation in her eyes. But when she saw that the person opening the door was Daniel, her whole body froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was wearing a construction uniform and a yellow helmet commonly used on construction sites. He looked at Veronica with a sinister smile and said, "Let's see today if Mason will come to save you. If he doesn't come, you'll die here alone. Don't blame me. Blame Mason for not coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica wanted to shout and question Daniel, but her mouth was taped shut. At this moment, she couldn't make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she was also afraid that Daniel would notice something unusual about her feet. After all, she was barefoot now, and her shoes and socks were scattered around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Daniel didn't notice these things, or perhaps he was very confident in his own plan and didn't think Veronica had any chance of escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Daniel closed the door of the auditorium again. Immediately afterwards, Veronica heard Daniel shouting to someone outside, "We've checked here. Everything's normal. No one's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica increased the speed of grinding the rope in her hand. The most important thing now was to quickly break the rope in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Mason...if Mason really came, then...at this moment, she didn't want him to enter this dangerous situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she really can't escape, at least she hopes he can live well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel stood outside with a smug look on his face. In just half an hour, the explosion would be triggered on time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason should be coming soon. Then there will be a good show to watch! He has placed Veronica's phone in the auditorium and set a timed message to be sent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the explosion is triggered, a message will be sent to Mason's phone. At that time, Mason will know that Veronica is inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What will Mason do then? Will he stop the explosion immediately and then rush in, or will he just charge in directly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Mason charges in, he is destined to die!</span></p></div>
