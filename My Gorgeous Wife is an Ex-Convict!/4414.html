        <h1>Chapter 4412: Unexpected Visitor</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the kiss ended, Calvert was panting heavily. Despite his heavy makeup, a faint blush could still be seen on his face, and his earlobes were even more flushed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips, the color of water, shimmered with a radiant glow. Her black eyes, on the other hand, seemed to be veiled in a mysterious mist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She... she wants to be affectionate again!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley quickly suppressed her thoughts, feeling like she was becoming more and more "naughty"!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cough, cough, go ahead and remove your makeup, I'll wait for you," she said, clearing her throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert finally left.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was alone in the room with nothing to do, so he casually picked up a booklet from the table and started reading.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The booklet is filled with photos of this season's models wearing finished designer clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Calvert is among them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to other models, even in such flat photos, Calvert still stands out more than others!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sound of the room door being pushed open echoed, followed by the footsteps of someone walking in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley didn't look up, thinking it was Calvert who had returned. "You sure took off your makeup pretty fast, huh."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley," the man's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley suddenly stiffened, looking up at the person who just walked in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell, what on earth brought him here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley squinted at the other person, "You didn't walk into the wrong room, did you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came specifically to see you," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You have something else to say to me? I thought we've already said everything that needed to be said," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell began, "Do you really think your choice is the right one?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right or wrong, what matters is, I've made my choice," Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you doing this to get back at me?" he abruptly asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Harley was taken aback, looking at the other person with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you sought out Calvert to provoke me after we broke off our engagement, didn't you? Is it because I didn't value your feelings and was indifferent to you back then? You wanted me to regret my indifference, to see what my true feelings for you were, right?" Lornell stepped forward, standing in front of Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I admit it, I love you, Harley, I love you. I went abroad to completely let you go, but after two years, I found that I simply can't. These past two years, you've constantly been on my mind, driving me almost insane!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was completely honest with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he found out she was officially dating Calvert, he was in a daze, as if he had lost something very precious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, a voice inside him was urging him to act quickly, or else he might live a life filled with regret!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's had enough of the regrets of these past two years!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to feel regret anymore. He wanted to firmly grasp what once belonged to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at Lornell in front of him with surprise, as if he was looking at a stranger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected Lornell to say something like that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley, can we start over? Since you liked me for so many years, you're bound to fall for me again. As for Calvert, he's just a fleeting passerby in your life. Besides, do you really think he befriended you without any ulterior motives? Even if he didn't have any at first, he developed them later. Otherwise, how could he possibly thrive so well in this circle?" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley took a deep breath, ready to speak, when suddenly she heard a noise at the door. Then, she heard someone say, "Oh, Mr. Elledge, why are you standing by the door and not going in?"</span></p></div>
