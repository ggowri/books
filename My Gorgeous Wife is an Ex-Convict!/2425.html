        <h1>Chapter 2423</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said, get lost!" His cold voice and gaze made the woman shudder. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss got up to leave, but several men surrounded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you planning to leave? We don't like you treating women like that! You're not leaving today unless you make things up to this beautiful woman," the leader of the men said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman took the opportunity to walk to the man's side while making herself look pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss could immediately see that these people were in cahoots with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled contemptuously. "What's the matter? Are you after money? Okay, come and get it if you can." With that said, he raised his hand, unbuttoned his suit jacket, and took it off. Then, he took off the luxury watch he wore on his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their eyes immediately flashed with envy at the sight of that watch. If that watch was genuine, it must be worth millions of dollars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He might be a big target, after all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They rushed toward Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the Weiss family was once poor, the Weiss family had always been affluent except for those difficult years. Martin Weiss had received various combat training since childhood, and his physical fitness was far stronger than ordinary people. He also knew many fighting skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was up against several people, he was not on the losing end. Instead, every punch he threw was deadly. He had been drinking, so the alcohol made him numb to pain. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thugs were stunned as they did not expect to have offended someone tough. The woman who approached Martin Weiss at the beginning was dumbfounded as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Martin Weiss pick up a man and repeatedly bang the man's head against the wall, causing the man's face to be covered with blood, the woman felt weak and wanted to escape. However, she did not even have the strength to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the thugs were all down and the woman was lying limp on the ground, a voice rang out. "I wanted to come and help, but it looks like you don't need it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked up only to see a tall figure walking over slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian." The words came out of his mouth coldly. It seemed that Deer City was really small. Not only did he see Jason here but also Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect to run into you here. It's been a while, Martin Weiss," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had met Martin Weiss several times in Emerald City. He also knew that Martin Weiss came to Deer City because of Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Judging from the state you're in, I'd better take you to the hospital," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Martin Weiss bent over, put on his watch again, put on his suit jacket, and walked out of the bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled lightly and followed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people in the bar were still a little stunned until someone suddenly exclaimed, "That man earlier&hellip; seems to be the crown prince of the entertainment industry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't the man who fought with those people call him Brian? That's the name of the crown prince!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh my God, the crown prince was here! Who was that man talking to the crown prince, then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who knows? Perhaps someone influential too. Otherwise, could the crown prince have been so good-tempered with him?"</p></div>
