        <h1>Chapter 1768</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian looked up at the person in front of him. "Really? I don&rsquo;t think she would leave me to die even if I hadn't saved her and Mason first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That was just the kind of person she was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was born with a strong sense of justice in her heart. Why else would she choose to become a lawyer? Even after experiencing such ups and downs in life, she still chose to continue her career as a lawyer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was attracted to her not only because of their childhood experience, but also her immutable sense of justice and serene elegance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">These qualities were precious to those who were used to the schemes and plots in rich and powerful families.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If it were only because of the obsession he had as a child, then he would have fallen in love with Hua Stella when Hua Stella pretended to be Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason immediately snapped. "That's enough! So what even if she won't leave you to die? You&rsquo;re no more than a childhood friend to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I'm just a childhood friend. But if you hadn't tampered with things, would I have mistaken someone else for her? I could have found her even sooner. If we went back in time, do you think she would have chosen&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Brian finished speaking, Jason had already rushed forward and grabbed his collar. "Brian, we can never go back in time! I'm the one Grace has always loved!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But does she know you're so despicable? Jason, I only lost because I'm not as despicable as you!" Brian said defiantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the door of the consulting room opened and Dr. Russell came out with a tired face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two men rushed up to Dr. Russell. "Dr. Russell, how&rsquo;s Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There&rsquo;s nothing we can do for now. The state of her hands is horrible. We can't use a needle knife at all. We can only operate on her, but I'm not too certain about this decision," said Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is there another doctor who can treat her hands?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm afraid there's no one in the country, but I'm not too sure about abroad. The world is so big, after all. But the girl's hands will only worsen if they aren't operated on within a week. They can no longer be operated on by then," said Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's face instantly turned extremely grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian trembled, and there was not a trace of color on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Dr. Russell, how confident are you in this?" Brian asked with a quiver in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ten percent," said Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two men's hearts instantly sank. Ten percent of success. She was in critical condition!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason first arranged for Grace to be admitted to the best private hospital in tMason Swansonty, while they stuck to Dr. Russell&rsquo;s conservative treatment plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he was still hesitating about the surgery. He... wanted to at least wait until Grace woke up so she could make the decision herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace woke up, she saw Jason sitting by the bed. Her first words were, "How's Mason? Has he woken up? Has Lily given him the cure?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She asked a series of questions all about the child and none about herself.</p></div>
