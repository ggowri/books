        <h1>Chapter 2251</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she knew how much her daughter had suffered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of pitiful, her daughter was much more pitiful than Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, Mom. Why don't you have an early rest?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gently looked down once she saw her mother returning to her room. She raised her hand to her chest and sighed sadly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since coming back to the store, all she could think about was what she saw in Martin Weiss's office&mdash;Jacqueline Bowman leaning on Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew there must be something wrong there. After all, Jacqueline Bowman had nothing much to do with Martin Weiss before, but the sight still caused her chest to feel stuffy. She even had the urge to rush forward and pull them apart earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is wrong with me? I shouldn't care about it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her marriage to Martin Weiss was just a matter of expediency. They had even agreed to divorce in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Martin Weiss was not with Jacqueline Bowman today but with any other woman, she should not care!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that, so why...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because I found out Martin Weiss is donating blood for me, so it stirred my heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, I should stop thinking about it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla kept telling herself that, but Martin Weiss's face repeatedly flashed across her mind all night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla dressed up on the day of the parent-child event. She wore a long yellow dress instead of her usual dark clothes. Her hair was tied up in a ponytail as usual, but she used a newly bought barrette. She also wore sneakers and put on a white mohair cardigan, making her look youthful and fashionable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Nelson saw his mother this morning, he could not help saying, "Mommy, you look so beautiful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled faintly. She dressed up because she did not want to embarrass her son. However, she knew her son would not be ashamed of her regardless of whether she dressed up or not. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, she wanted to do better for her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After breakfast, Kyla looked at the time and had no idea when Martin Weiss would come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she froze as soon as she opened the door. Martin Weiss was standing right outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you knock?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss seemed a little embarrassed as he said, "I was afraid... I'd disturb you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You could just knock the next time," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Next time...' The words made Martin Weiss's expression change a little. Then, he told himself not to overthink. The more he overthought, the more disappointed he would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should know that by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are we going to Nelson's school now?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," replied Kyla.</p></div>
