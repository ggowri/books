        <h1>Chapter 4012</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It has been five months since she fell into a coma, and the baby in her belly is about the size of a 25-week-old fetus!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her vegetative state, this baby miraculously survived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the doctors were amazed by this miracle. After all, Nancy was seriously injured, but in this situation, not only did she survive, but her child also survived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy also learned that because she didn't have any identification documents, the old lady who brought her to the clinic claimed that she was her daughter. It was just that when she was born, no identification was processed, so the clinic accepted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was very grateful to the old lady.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, Nancy worked hard to recover her body. She fell into the sea, suffered multiple fractures, and even injured her lungs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In such a small clinic, there were no good medical conditions. If she wanted better treatment, she had to go to a big hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the old lady came to see her, Nancy proposed the idea of &#8203;&#8203;reapplying for her identification and phone card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, with her current physical condition, she couldn't make it back to Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, all her luggage was left in the rented room. But that day was also the day to move out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had been five months, and her luggage should now be kept by the landlord, or... thrown away as garbage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, her phone was lost when she was kidnapped by Irene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, she couldn't even call the landlord to inquire about her luggage because she didn't remember the landlord's phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, only by reapplying for her identification and phone card here, could she repay the old lady for the medical expenses she had paid for her, and then use the remaining money for treatment and childbirth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she fell into the sea, she was already prepared for death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, God has given her a great gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the father of the child never expected this child, this child... is the only relative she has in this life. No matter what, she wants to give birth to this child and have this child accompany her in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Baby, you also want to live, right? That's why, even in such a difficult situation, you're still staying in mommy's belly. Let's...work hard together to survive!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy gently stroked her already swollen belly, murmuring to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she opened her eyes, her belly was already very noticeable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made her feel even more keenly aware of her pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Getting a new ID card went smoothly, as there were already records in the system. It was just that Nancy was lying in the hospital and couldn't move, so the staff came to the clinic to help her with the special circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They took some photos on the spot and had some conversations to ask some questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the staff left, Nancy looked at Miss Fowler who was accompanying her, "Auntie, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thanking me for? Don't pay me back for that money in the future. Take good care of yourself. I'm just one person and can't spend much money. I can still work now." Miss Fowler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Auntie..." Nancy's eyes were moist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Miss Fowler had no reason to help her, but she was able to survive because of Miss Fowler's compassion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, she and the baby in her belly would not have survived until today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Auntie, from now on, you can treat me as your child. I have no parents or other relatives. The three of us, you, me, and the baby in my belly, can rely on each other, okay?" Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Miss Fowler was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When I recover and give birth to the baby, we will both be filial to you!" Nancy said. "Besides, you have the surname Fowler, and I also have the surname Fowler. Maybe we were destined to meet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Miss Fowler's eyes also began to moisten. "If you don't mind this useless old lady..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You saved both me and my baby's lives, so please don't look down on me now that I'm just lying in a hospital bed," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I had a granddaughter, she would be around your age. If you're willing, you can be my granddaughter from now on," Miss Fowler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma!" Nancy exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The estranged family relationship seemed to be reconciled at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy thought that her days would just pass by like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She planned to use her savings to slowly treat her illness after giving birth. Although her savings were not much, around a hundred thousand, it should be enough for the cheapest treatment until the baby was born and for the first year of expenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, she could find a way to work again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her body was already broken, she would persevere for the sake of her child and Miss Fowler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she did not expect that a group of people would rush into her hospital room the next day, reminding her of the difficulties she might face in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These people included doctors and nurses from the hospital, as well as leaders from the hospital, but they just stood by and watched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person they surrounded was the mayor of this small city!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was dumbfounded. Why would the mayor come to her hospital room? Was there some kind of condolence activity in the city?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she did not see anyone holding a camera or a video camera around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Nancy, we're sorry that we only found out about you now. We will immediately arrange for the best hospital to admit you and the best doctors from the county to treat you. Other professional medical teams from other places will also come for consultation later. If you need anything, please feel free to let us know," the mayor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy listened to all of this, feeling confused and unsure of what was happening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was she still dreaming? She couldn't quite understand what the mayor was saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if it was just a visit from the city, it seemed a bit too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um, I...I don't have a lot of money, I just need some simple treatment for now," Nancy stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry about the money, if there's nothing else, we can transfer you to another hospital this afternoon," the mayor said warmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, in the afternoon, Nancy was transferred to a county hospital belonging to the city, where several doctors consulted on her case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made Miss Fowler a bit nervous, not understanding what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, they're just treating me," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But how can it be free of charge for no reason?" Miss Fowler was skeptical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was silent for a moment. "Maybe someone thinks I'm pitiful and wants to help me. Grandma, if someone who knows me suddenly comes to find me, don't be surprised. You're my grandmother, my family. When I'm better, I'll take care of you."</p></div>
