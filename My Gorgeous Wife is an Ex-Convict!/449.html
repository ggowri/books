        <h1>Chapter 448</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I should let her know the truth?" Jason asked lightly, but there was a deep chill in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence's body suddenly shivered. He knew that he had accidentally touched his boss's sore point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">About the lawsuit and Grace&hellip; This was not a matter Young Master Reed would let outsiders pry into.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All he had to do was just follow Young Master Reed's instructions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go to S city now," said Terrence. Then, he left the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as he got out of the study, he saw Grace walking toward him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you looking for Young Master Reed, Miss Cummins?" Terrence asked respectfully. He knew in his heart that she would be the mistress of the Reed family if everything went well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Young Master Reed was just playing around with the woman at first, he was now very serious about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could even say that he had never seen Young Master Reed take a woman so seriously. Even Jennifer Atkinson, who was only one step away from becoming the mistress of the Reed family, was never taken as seriously by Young Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace had done it. Few people in Emerald City would ever expect this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," responded Grace. "Did something urgent happen with the company that brought you here this late at night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but it's not very important. I'll leave you be and go now," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Goodbye, then, Terrence," said Grace. She went to the study door. After knocking on it twice, she pushed it open and went in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence sighed softly when he saw the study door close again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that Grace would not get the truth she wanted tomorrow. The truth would be buried. Even though Young Master Reed was not the culprit, but... Young Master Reed had sat by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young Master Reed was probably regretting it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence rushed downstairs and left Reed Residence. After all, he had a lot of work to do tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was in the study and saw Jason standing by the window. He looked at her with a smile on his face. He asked, "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just wanted to tell you that Lina will pick us up as we're going to S city with her tomorrow. She says it's easier to talk to each other when we're all in one car, and if someone gets tired driving, another can take over," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, no problem," replied Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll set out at seven o'clock in the morning. Since it&rsquo;ll be a two-hour drive, it&rsquo;ll be a little over nine o'clock when we reach there," added Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No problem. Since we're leaving at seven o 'clock tomorrow, you should go to bed early," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I still have a few things to take care of. You should go to bed first. I'll go to bed after I'm done," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. After all, he had to run such a large company. It was normal for him to be busy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around and was about to leave the study when Jason suddenly reached out and pulled her into his arms. He hugged her tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Grace was caught off guard. His hug was too sudden.</p></div>
