        <h1>Chapter 3936</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick returned to the Reed House and saw his sister Jasper coming down from upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brother, I heard you played the hero today?" Jasper blurted out as soon as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick raised an eyebrow, "Where did you hear that from?" He knew his subordinates well and they wouldn't casually talk about such things without his permission.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I saw it online. Someone uploaded a video of you helping someone today, but Dad had it taken down. You can't find it now." Jasper said, then looked at his brother with excitement, "It's the first time I've seen you take the initiative to help a woman like that. Is she your friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, there were basically no female friends around his brother. Even if he sometimes got closer to some women, it was usually because of work or school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, she knew all the girls who were close to his brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman in the video today was obviously a stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's not really a friend." Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, I see." Jasper was obviously disappointed, thinking that his brother had finally fallen in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Mick's next sentence made Jasper's expression change again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you usually do with William?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked and looked at his brother strangely, "Why are you asking this, big brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just curious." Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Actually, it's not much different from before. We just go to the library together, go shopping, watch movies, listen to concerts, eat together, or go to a bar. During the holidays, we travel around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that it?" Mick frowned slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What else should we do?" Jasper asked back, feeling a bit embarrassed to say that sometimes she and William would do some intimate things when they were together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, William always respected her and never crossed any lines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Doing these things, will it make you clear about your feelings for William? Will it make you understand whether you really love him or not?" Mick asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm...I guess you could say that," Jasper thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, before dating William, she only thought she liked him. But after becoming more intimate with him, she realized that her liking for him was actually love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Mick whispered, "Well, go to bed early."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he walked upstairs on his own, leaving Jasper standing there scratching her head inexplicably. What's wrong with big brother? Why did he suddenly ask such a strange question?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Also, that woman, if she wasn't even a friend of big brother's, why did he help her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't so "helpful" before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was at the entrance of Nancy's company, helping with Nancy's video. Except for Jasper asking Mick a few questions, no one else from the Reed family had come to inquire about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason and Grace didn't ask because they thought their son was old enough. If the woman in the video really had a special meaning to their son, he would naturally tell them in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Mason knew about the video, he didn't ask about it at all. As for the youngest Jasmine, she didn't even know about the video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family was calm and quiet, but it was completely different on Nancy's side.</p></div>
