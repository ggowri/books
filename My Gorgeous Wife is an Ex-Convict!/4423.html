        <h1>Chapter 4421: Unusual Signs</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Calvert thought the dark cloud over his father would finally lift, he never expected to receive a call from the police station. They informed him that his father's body had been found in a dilapidated alley, stabbed seventeen times.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he rushed to the police station and saw his father's mangled body, a surreal feeling suddenly washed over him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had wished countless times to be rid of such a disgraceful father, even thinking that it would be best if such a father were dead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when I truly saw my father's lifeless body, there was a heaviness in my heart, yet it felt empty at the same time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A complex feeling almost overwhelmed him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just stood there, dazed, in front of the body until the police called out to him several times. Snapping back to reality, he signed his name on the form they handed him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the case hasn't been cracked yet, the body needs to stay at the police station for further autopsy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert sat in the police station's rest area, lost in thought. His mind replayed scenes with his father, over and over. The warm moments from his childhood memories with his father were few and far between, mostly overshadowed by painful memories.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, he... he still didn't want this man to actually die like this, especially not in such a tragic way!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert!" A breathless voice rang in his ears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stiffened, slowly lifting his head to meet Harley's worried face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth, but for a moment, he didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, I know everything!" Harley said, sitting down beside him and taking his hand. "The police will definitely catch the killer. How... how are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, what she's most worried about is how he feels.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Mr. Elledge really isn't much, he is, after all, his biological father.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Calvert took a deep breath, "I'm fine, let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, he stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stood up too, "Are you really okay?" But she hesitated a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've considered him dead for a long time, so... I'm fine," Calvert said, taking Harley's hand and walking out of the police station.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they got in the car, he asked, "What would you like to eat?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anything is fine," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he drove her to their usual dining spot, where they had dinner together just like always, then strolled through the mall before finally taking Harley back home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll come to your apartment tonight," Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Calvert's face changed slightly, "But..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're dating now, so it shouldn't be a big deal if I spend the night at your place, right? Besides, I've already told my parents I won't be coming home tonight," Harley said. "Or is there some reason you can't let me stay over tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"...," he paused for a moment before saying, "It's... it's nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car pulled up to the apartment, and his actions were all as usual--washing up as always, kissing her cheek as always, and saying goodnight as always.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his apartment, there was a room specifically for her, so she could rest here occasionally.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more he acted like everything was normal, the more worried Harley became.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, the more it seems this way, the more it indicates that there's some kind of problem.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dead of night, Harley couldn't help but leave his own bedroom and head to Calvert's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she walked into his bedroom, she found it completely empty!</span></p></div>
