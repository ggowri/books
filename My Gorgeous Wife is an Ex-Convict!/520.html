        <h1>Chapter 519</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer and Elsie Jordan were surprised to hear this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer suddenly laughed. "I thought you were someone important, but it turns out that you&rsquo;re a murderer. Does Jason know that you're the one who killed Jennifer Atkinson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer could not wait to see the expression on Grace's face when Jason found out that Grace was the culprit in the car accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her opinion, Jason must be in the dark about this. Otherwise, how could he let Grace show up so glamorously as his date at the banquet?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elsie Jordan pursed her lips into a smile. "By the way, Sean is also in attendance today. I even saw him and Lily just now. How about we let you ex-couples meet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer got excited at this though. She immediately looked around the venue. As it happened, Sean and Lily were not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer shouted in their direction, "Your ex-girlfriend is here, Sean. Won't you come and meet her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer's voice was not soft. It was not just Sean, but even the people around them heard her. The guests immediately looked in their direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer clearly wanted to see Grace make a fool of herself by doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean was stunned and turned his head to follow the sound. Then, he saw Grace in a lilac-colored gown. He immediately had a faraway look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked classy and elegant today. Her delicate makeup and hairdo made him feel like he was looking at the person she used to be three and a half years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, she was even more beautiful than before. She had gone through a lot over the years. After all that had happened, her claws were not drawn in, but there was an air of calmness about her that made people feel comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was... Grace here?! Did Jason bring her here? However, why was Jason not with her now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A series of questions flashed through Sean's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lily, who was standing next to Sean, saw the faraway look on his face, her eyes glistened slightly. Then, she smiled and said, "Let's go over, Sean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean responded as he seemed to come to his senses suddenly. Then, he walked over to Grace with Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect to see you here," Sean said with a somewhat wry smile as he walked up to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's a lot more you didn't expect." Before Grace could answer, Tasha Farmer seemed to be motivated by a desire to see the world in chaos. She said, "Your ex-girlfriend is brought here today by Jason. It seems that your ex-girlfriend is getting along better without you, Sean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer had meant to mock Grace, but it was Lily's face that paled instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elsie Jordan saw his reaction and hurriedly smoothed things over. "Don't mind her, Lily. Tasha just speaks whatever&rsquo;s on her mind sometimes. She didn't mean to embarrass you."</p></div>
