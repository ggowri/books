        <h1>Chapter 3166</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, she is my fianc&eacute;e Valda. Valda, this is my Auntie Sandy," Brian introduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello Auntie Sandy," Valda politely smiled and greeted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young woman standing next to Auntie Sandy spoke up before Auntie Sandy had a chance to say anything. "Brian, I thought your fianc&eacute;e would be much prettier, but now that I see her, she looks so ordinary. Your taste is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person's words abruptly stopped short, as Brian's piercing gaze fixed coldly upon her with a glint that seemed capable of freezing her to the core.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the surrounding air pressure has decreased significantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Say one more thing, Lexi, and see what happens," Brian said in a cold tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young woman, who goes by the name of Lexi, immediately blushed and turned pale, stammering and unable to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Auntie Sandy quickly said, "Okay, okay, it was just a slip of the tongue from Lexi. Brian, please don't take it to heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda is my fianc&eacute;e, and I don't want to hear this kind of talk again. If I hear it again, don't blame me for disregarding family ties," Brian said, holding Valda's hand and walking inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was clearly defending Valda, and Auntie Sandy's face turned ugly. Lexi, her daughter, glared at Valda's back with anger but didn't dare to speak up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other relatives looked at each other in confusion. After a while, someone said, "Okay, let's all be mindful of what we say in the future. After all, that woman is Brian's fianc&eacute;e and will be the future daughter-in-law of the Hart family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph, she's just a cripple!" Lexi muttered, "I don't know what tricks she used to make Brian defend her like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough, you talk too much!" Auntie Sandy scolded her daughter. "Have you forgotten about the news that caused a stir before? Tracy offended Valda, and as a result, the Barlow family was ruined by Brian. Do you want our family to be the second Barlow family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, how could that happen? We're relatives with Brian!" Lexi rolled her eyes, obviously not agreeing with her mother. "Anyway, I just don't like this woman. Many people in our school are talking about how Brian is going to marry this cripple, and it's embarrassing for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, she had enjoyed the attention from her classmates because she was Brian's cousin. Especially now that she was studying film and television at a prestigious university, majoring in acting, she was even more popular among her classmates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Brian was a prince in the entertainment industry! As his cousin, her future path to stardom was naturally smooth, and those classmates who flattered her naturally wanted to get some resources from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, she had enjoyed this kind of attention from her classmates, which made her feel superior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Recently, due to the news about Valda and Tracy, many students in school have been discussing it. Some even approached her and asked if Valda is really going to be her sister-in-law and why the prince would be interested in someone with a limp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even some people's gaze towards her has changed, making her feel like everyone is laughing at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she thought about having to call a crippled sister-in-law in the future, she felt nauseous. Especially this crippled person, who was not particularly attractive and also an orphan, made her feel as if she was being humiliated!</p></div>
