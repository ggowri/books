        <h1>Chapter 2504</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, he intends to save Kyla&mdash;even at the risk of his own life," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt the urge to cry. It was like what Jay had said before. Martin Weiss would not stand idly by if Kyla was dying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect Martin Weiss to resolutely lie on the operating room table at such a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if some love was forgotten due to hypnosis, a lot of it would have already been etched in the bones and blood. It was why Martin Weiss chose to save Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason waited outside the operating room. As time went by, Grace became increasingly nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Will the operation be a success? Is Martin Weiss and Kyla going to be okay?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Kyla is rescued but something happens to Martin Weiss, Kyla will probably be unhappy in the future. After all, Kyla's greatest wish is for Martin Weiss to live a good life.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, even Mrs. Corbyn had returned to the waiting area outside the operating room door. The operating room door finally opened, and the doctor walked out from inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Doctor, how's my daughter?" Mrs. Corbyn hurried forward and asked. After she returned, Grace had told her that Kyla was having a liver transplant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two operations were done together because the sooner the liver transplant was performed, the lower the risk of the other organs in Kyla&rsquo;s body being affected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Although the operation is successful, we need to continue observation after the patient wakes up," the doctor replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was finally relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace asked, "What about Martin Weiss? How is he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's healthy, but having a liver transplant twice will cause some damage to his body. He&rsquo;ll need a long time to recuperate his body. He should be fine as long as he makes it past the critical 24 hours," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace heaved a sigh of relief, hoping Martin Weiss could survive the 24-hour crisis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, by the way..." The doctor paused. "Mr. Weiss said he hopes you won't tell Miss Corbyn that he donated his liver to her. He doesn't want her to know, so he hopes those in the know can keep it a secret."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn and Grace looked at each other, not expecting Martin Weiss to not let Kyla know after risking his life for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla and Martin Weiss were soon wheeled into the isolation wards. Kyla required 72 hours of observation, while Martin Weiss required only 24 hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two were in different wards but were only separated by a wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stood in the hallway and watched Kyla and Martin Weiss through the transparent glass window. The two loved each other but were now... so far apart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's on your mind?" Jason looked down and asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why was Martin Weiss willing to donate his liver to save Kyla?" Grace murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because he loves Kyla," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But wasn't he hypnotized? How deep can his feelings for Kyla be even if he later developed feelings for her again?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if some feelings are hypnotized, your body will still remember them. There&rsquo;ll be joy, heartache, reluctance to see them in pain, fear of losing them... Martin Weiss doesn&rsquo;t want Kyla to leave this world, so he could only gamble his life to save Kyla," Jason murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. Martin Weiss's love might be deeper than she imagined.</p></div>
