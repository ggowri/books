        <h1>Chapter 4387 Two Years Later</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Calvert managed to reconcile with the detained girl and the cleaning staff. He also moved to a new place. This time, he specifically hired professional housekeeping staff from a reputable company to clean the house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although their mediation was done privately and wasn't reported by the news media, there's not much privacy in this circle. So, people in the circle knew about it. Some more informed people knew that Harley was also involved in this incident. Therefore, their attitude towards Calvert became a bit more cautious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this incident, Calvert gained quite a few resources.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were the old him, knowing that these resources were offered because someone wanted to curry favor with Harley, hoping to build a relationship through him, he would have </span><span>definitely refused</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But back then, he wasn't turning down those resources.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he yearned for success, he wanted to be closer to Harley, and he hoped that one day, he could stand by her side without feeling inferior anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted it this way, he could only achieve it by striving for success and constantly climbing upwards!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's agent, on the other hand, was quite relieved by his transformation. After all, in this industry, only those who become famous have a say.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should have done this a long time ago. Since you and Miss Hart are close, it's only right that you get more resources. Even if Miss Hart finds out, she won't blame you. After all, she must know that her helping you would spread around this circle and that some people who want to please her would give you resources. But she didn't stop it, did she? That means she's already given her tacit approval," the agent said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert remained silent. Would Harley </span><span>really not</span><span> blame him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, he was just so desperate to become stronger!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he needed time and opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he wanted was </span><span>definitely more</span><span> than just a friendship!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by, and before you knew it, two years had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert had graduated from university and was then both a model and an actor, becoming quite famous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past couple of years, he had gone from being a supporting actor to the leading man. Every TV show or movie he had been in had received high praise. Moreover, the more significant his role, the more popular the show or movie became.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much so that he had become a top-notch actor in the eyes of many directors, with a lot of them wanting to collaborate with him!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clothes he wore became hot items that everyone wanted to buy. As a result, many big brands actively sponsored him with their new seasonal styles. In no time, he became the darling of the fashion world and even landed endorsements for luxury brands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a newcomer who had only been in the industry for two years, such an achievement was quite rare.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether they were in the industry or not, everyone was </span><span>really bullish</span><span> on Calvert. Some even said that in a few years, he could probably have been an Oscar-winning actor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, Harley was looking at Calvert in front of her, shyly eating his ice cream. It was hard to reconcile this image with his usual persona in front of the media.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past couple of years, he had grown incredibly fast. In front of the media and fans, he had become more and more adept. He had learned to flash a practiced smile, to handle issues with strategy, to be gentle, but also to be stern when needed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter which one it was, he seemed to be wearing a mask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only in front of her, he seemed like the same Calvert she first met.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the ice cream good?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm-hmm," he responded, "It's really quite good. </span><span>But,</span><span> you've been staring at me this whole time. What's on your mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His beautiful eyes were just staring at her like that!</span></p></div>
