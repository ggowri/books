        <h1>Chapter 4071</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina sighed. Now that her daughter was grown up, she could tell her some things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At that time, your father tried to investigate Hunter but couldn't find any useful information. So he wanted to go to Hunter's family to investigate, but Hunter is from the Crypt families, and the location of their family is unknown to the public. It took a lot of effort to find out where Hunter was."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After that, Hadwin sent his men to Hunter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man he sent was a former mercenary, and his skills were top-notch. He also brought a small team with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this kind of force, they could even infiltrate a secret location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, these people were all captured within 15 minutes of entering Hunter's family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to Hunter's original plan, these people were supposed to disappear without a trace. But Chandler happened to be there that day and recognized one of them as Hadwin's right-hand man. He knew that these people were from the Stephenson family, so he spoke up to save them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, it wasn't as simple as just saying a few words. Hunter made Hadwin sign a document promising not to investigate Hunter anymore. In addition, except for Tina, who would marry Chandler in the future, no one from the Stephenson family could ever step into Hunter's family again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Hadwin, such a request was equivalent to an insult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His daughter was going to marry into the Hunter family, and he couldn't even go to their house to visit. What kind of situation was this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the time, Hadwin almost called off the wedding and even considered sending someone to rescue the person from the Hunter family and confront them directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was surprised to hear her mother recounting this past event.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened afterwards?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Afterwards..." Lina shrugged. "I don't know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Mom, how could you not know?" Tina widened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I really don't know," Lina said. "Later, Chandler and your father had a private conversation in the study. I didn't hear what they talked about, and when I asked your father afterwards, he didn't say anything, just expressed his trust in Chandler!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did Dad sign the agreement in the end?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not sure, but Hunter did return your father's men. After that, your father didn't inquire about Hunter's affairs anymore, nor did he send anyone to the Hunter family again," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina listened to the unfamiliar story and felt a strange sense of novelty and unreality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It felt like she was listening to a story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because Hunter was too mysterious?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Hunter family... it was like a forbidden place that couldn't be entered. Once you stepped in, you didn't know what would happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After Chandler and I get married, can I go to the Hunter family?" Tina asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, that's what he said back then," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a voice sounded, "What are you talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mother and daughter turned around, and it was Hadwin who had come back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're talking about Dad sending someone to Hunter's house back then," Tina said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin raised an eyebrow and looked at his wife, "Did you tell Tina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The child is 20 years old now and at the age to get married. There are some things that I think she should know," Lina said.</p></div>
