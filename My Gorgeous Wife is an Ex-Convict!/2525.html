        <h1>Chapter 2523</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He tiredly rubbed his brow in the car. A great sense of weariness filled his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, he did Amber Mitchell wrong today. However, he had to do it to save Simon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides, didn't Amber Mitchell betray my affections? Why should I feel guilty?' George Gregory thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back at the Gregory family&rsquo;s house, Old Master Gregory and Old Madam Gregory came over and asked, "How was it? Will Louise Mitchell help Simon with his transfusion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She&rsquo;s receiving a body check-up in the hospital. Even if she refuses, I'll make her help Simon with the transfusion," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Madam Gregory was finally relieved, but she could not help lecturing, "How could there be such a mother? Her son needs her blood, yet she wants to make a bargain using this! After Simon recovers, divorce her no matter what. How could such a woman be the Gregory family's daughter-in-law?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Gregory had no objection to his wife's statement and agreed with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was also a little afraid of his daughter-in-law, Louise Mitchell. The Mitchell family indeed made people uncomfortable. Since the Mitchell family could shamelessly frame their own daughter, who knew what they would do in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be good to cut ties with the Mitchell family now. It would be better for their grandson not to have such a mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can Simon recover after the transfusion?" Old Madam Gregory was nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"According to the doctor, there's a high possibility he'll recover. If the transfusion with Louise Mitchell's blood fails to cure him, we'll think of another way. I'll contact doctors abroad to see what treatment options are available," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Madam Gregory wept. "Why is Simon so unfortunate? Louise Mitchell doesn't deserve to be a mother. If she had been willing to help Simon with his transfusion sooner, Simon would not have suffered so much! Who would have thought that even Amber Mitchell would donate blood to Simon, but his own mother&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, stop," reminded Old Master Gregory. When they went to the hospital, they accidentally learned that one other person had donated blood apart from the three medical staff. That person happened to be Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Gregory and Old Madam Gregory were shocked for a while after learning that Amber Mitchell had donated blood to Simon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Madam Gregory said no more as if she realized something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said indifferently, "Alright, I'm going back to my room to rest." With that said, he walked to his room. He tiredly took off his clothes after entering his room. He entered the bathroom and let the warm water wash over his tired body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he had only sat in the gallery during the trial, every second felt like he was on pins and needles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell did not even look at him much during the trial. Even if she glanced at him occasionally, it only seemed unintentional. He even hoped that she could look at him more, but it seemed like he did not exist to her at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory lowered his head as his fingers gently touched his heart. He had once pressed the woman's hand firmly on his heart and said to her, "Amber Mitchell, I will forever be yours. You will be the only one I love in this life. If you don't love me, my heart will die and never revive."</p></div>
