        <h1>Chapter 3476</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason looked at his second son. After all, his son is still a teenager, so it's normal to not handle things well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have two options," Jason said. "Either make her fall in love with you, or forget about your feelings for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If she didn't fall in love with me, but I still couldn't forget her?" said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason smiled slightly and said, "In this world, there is always a way to forget about emotions, it just depends on whether you want to or not. Alternatively, if she can't fall in love with you, you can continue to be her 'little brother' and stay by her side, and then watch her date someone else in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's thin lips were tightly pursed. It seems that he can no longer play the role of her "little brother" properly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... he also doesn't want to forget about his feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So in the end, his only choice was, "I will make her fall in love with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason smiled slightly and said, "No matter what decision you make, I am your father and will support you. As I said before, the Reed family is your backing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daddy, thank you," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing his conversation with his son, Jason returned to the master bedroom where Grace was waiting for him. As soon as she saw her husband come in, she anxiously asked, "What's the situation with Mason now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jason said that he had a disagreement with Veronica. Mason confessed his feelings to Veronica, but she only sees him as a younger brother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace sighed, as expected, things turned out just as she had feared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These two children grew up together, but their relationship will inevitably be a bit rocky!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What should we do now?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jason said, 'Mason plans to make Veronica fall in love with him.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But when it comes to matters of the heart, you can't force it," Grace said. "If Veronica really only sees Mason as a brother, then we should respect her decision."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace treats Veronica like a daughter and doesn't want her to feel pressured to have feelings for anyone in the Reed family just because of their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason said, "No matter what the outcome may be in the future, I believe that our son will make the best decision he thinks is right. Since he is our son, we should also trust his choice!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I hope so," said Grace. But when it comes to matters of the heart, it takes two to tango. If only one party is willing, it will never work out in the end!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, don't worry anymore." Jason hugged his wife. "Grace, I will take care of this home, and take care of you and our child. So, you don't need to worry about anything, everything will be okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace leaned against Jason's chest, feeling the warmth emanating from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, he has always kept his promise to her and their children, from the past until now, without any change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jason, all I ask is that our family is doing well," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was surprised that Jasper came to find her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the Barlow family's door, Jasper, one of the triplets, stood at the entrance and said to Veronica, "Veronica, I came here today specifically to see you. Can I come in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Convenient," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Father, stepmother, and younger brother have all gone out, so now there's only her left at home.</p></div>
