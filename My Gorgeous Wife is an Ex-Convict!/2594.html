        <h1>Chapter 2592</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should have suspected it sooner. The pills were the same as those given to her after her liver transplant. However, she had carelessly assumed that the doctors gave her the pills because her liver was not doing well after her pregnancy. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How... careless of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly as she touched her right rib right away. It was where her liver would be, and her liver was from Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How much liver does Martin Weiss have left after donating to me twice?' She could hardly imagine it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What should I say when I first see Martin Weiss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Thank you, or sorry? Or maybe... I should tell him I love him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had known it was going to end up like this, maybe she would not have broken up with him like that in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted him to live, but she had caused him trouble instead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the high-speed train arrived in L City, Kyla got off and took a taxi to the address Grace gave her. The security guards unsurprisingly stopped her at the mansion&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to meet Martin Weiss. I'm his wife," Kyla said to the security guard at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the security guard looked at Kyla with a confused expression. "Is Mr. Weiss married? I've never heard of it. How many wives would he have if everyone just claims to be Mrs. Weiss?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Well, it was true that her marriage to Martin Weiss was not widely reported. Even if there was some gossip news, that was only in Emerald City. Not many people in L City know about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took out her marriage license with Martin Weiss. "There should be no other woman with this license!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect the security guard&rsquo;s next words. "Wow, this fake license looks so real! It's the first time I've met someone who came here with a false license to see Mr. Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was speechless. "I really am Martin Weiss's wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then call Mr. Weiss and ask him to let you in," the security guard said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Kyla rubbed her temples. She would have called Martin Weiss if she had his phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had either changed his phone number or... blocked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Either way, it meant Martin Weiss did not want anything to do with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While the two parties were locked in a stalemate, a voice suddenly said, "Mrs. Weiss, what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla turned around to see Mallory Malcom&mdash;Martin Weiss's private secretary. When she came to L City to see Martin Weiss before this, Mallory had taken care of her and helped her with her accommodation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to see Martin," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Chairman Weiss..." Mallory Malcom hesitated and said, "Why... Why don't I go in first and see what he wants?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing," Mallory Malcom said before walking quickly into the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guard at the entrance looked at Kyla in shock. "Are you really... Mrs. Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In the flesh. Not only now, but also forever," said Kyla. She did not want to divorce Martin Weiss. She wanted to be his wife forever!</p></div>
