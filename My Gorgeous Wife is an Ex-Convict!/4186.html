        <h1>Chapter 4184 Desolate Chandler</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Half a year after Tina's disappearance, Kit finished filming his last TV drama, which Tina had secured for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Then Kit announced that he would retire from the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This announcement immediately caused a stir!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Many people online were discussing this matter, and some of his fans even had extreme reactions, protesting and trying to persuade him to stay at his company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There were even some who threatened to jump into the river in refusal to accept Kit's retirement from the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But Kit remained indifferent to all of this and insisted on leaving the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Later, there were rumors online that Kit's retirement might be because of Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, Miss Stephenson from the Stephenson family used to be Kit's fan, and they seemed to have a close relationship. Since Miss Stephenson still hasn't been found after six months, it's very likely that she's no longer alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, Kit didn't respond to any of these online rumors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After that, he seemed to disappear from the entertainment industry, and over time, people online gradually stopped talking about Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, in the entertainment industry, there are always new idols replacing the ones who are gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> On the other side, in the Hunter family, after searching the river for Tina in vain, Chandler collapsed and was admitted to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> One week after being discharged, Chandler locked himself in the house he shared with Tina and stayed there for a month, not seeing anyone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Finally, with the help of Eugenia from the Hunter family, she rushed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia tearfully said, "Chandler, if Tina were to come back and see you so depressed, she would be furious. You know how much Tina loved to see you looking handsome and attractive. She always told me that her future husband should be the best-looking. Even if it's for Tina's sake, you shouldn't continue like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When she mentioned Tina's name, Chandler finally showed some reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's gaze fell on Eugenia's face. "What did Tina say and do when she came to save you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia shuddered and quickly recounted the events of that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although she had already told the police, the Stephenson family, and the Hunter family multiple times, she had never said it in front of Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler listened quietly, and after a long time, he said to Eugenia, "Tell me everything else between you and Tina that I don't know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Huh?" Eugenia looked at Chandler in a daze, but after a moment, she nodded repeatedly. "Okay, I'll tell you. Tina and I in school..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia stayed in the villa, constantly talking to Chandler about everything related to Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And Chandler listened quietly, no one knew what he was thinking at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia almost spent another month telling Chandler everything she knew about Tina, including their college days and Tina's cosplay photography.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia even brought many photos of her and Tina together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In short, anything related to Tina, no matter how trivial or boring, Eugenia mentioned it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After a long time, a slight curve appeared at the corner of Chandler's lips, as if crying and smiling at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, when will you come back to me?"</p></div>
