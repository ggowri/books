        <h1>Chapter 489</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was at the hospital visiting Nelson. This time, Nelson was awake and interacting with Kyla Corbyn who was also in the room. Kyla Corbyn was pointing at various objects and telling Nelson what they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was listening attentively, literally listening. He would occasionally point at the item that Kyla Corbyn mentioned earlier and she would repeat it for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace called out, &ldquo;Nelson.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, the boy turned around to look in her direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This had never happened before. That meant that Nelson could hear her voice! Grace was elated for the boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Nelson could hear now, it meant that there was a chance he could learn to speak in the future. As long as he wore a hearing aid, he could then function like a normal person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although three years old was a little late as doctors usually recommend that treatment begin as early as possible, the opportunity was not completely over as most children are not fully developed yet and would still absorb new sounds and languages like a sponge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went forward and ruffled the boy&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Nelson, you can now hear sounds. It won&rsquo;t be long before you start talking.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boy was very excited to hear Grace&rsquo;s voice. He waved both hands. Then, he pointed all over the room while making some audible sounds as if trying to express himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled and responded to each item that the boy pointed at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why are you here today? Haven't you just recently visited Nelson?&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Nelson was still sleeping the last time I came. That&rsquo;s why I came again today to see him. Fortunately, I&rsquo;m in luck to see Nelson awake,&rdquo; Grace said. Then, she asked Kyla Corbyn, &ldquo;How is Nelson now? Is this considered a good sign?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bad. He can be discharged in another two days' time. Later, he&rsquo;ll need to go to special classes for about a year. The doctor said that if he does well there, he should be able to catch up with his speech. Then, he&rsquo;ll be able to proceed with regular kindergarten.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s great to hear,&rdquo; Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yea.&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn smiled and let her mother bring Nelson for a stroll around the hospital before she poured a cup of water for Grace. &ldquo;Mr. Reed isn&rsquo;t here today.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, he went to his office. I had nothing to do at home and was bored. So I came over here.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You and him...&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to make yourself so tired by working as a delivery person at my shop. Mr. Reed can find you plenty of suitable jobs.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that Jason&rsquo;s girlfriend would be working as a delivery person in her small restaurant? Even Kyla Corbyn herself could hardly believe that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips and said, &ldquo;Perhaps... But probably out of dignity, I wish that I can be independent to a certain degree. I don&rsquo;t wish to become a parasite who relies fully on him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps the lesson she obtained from her relationship with Sean was so great that she was insistent on this matter up till now.</p></div>
