        <h1>Chapter 300</h1>
        <div><p>&quot;He&#x27;s the chairman of Stephenson Group, the current patriarch of the Stephenson family,&quot; Jason said. Then, he looked somewhat strangely at Grace. &quot;Don&#x27;t you know who he is? Have you never heard Lina mention him before?&quot;</p><p>Grace shook her head. She was certain that she had never heard the name Hadwin Stephenson from her best friend.</p><p>However, she did know that Stephenson Group was not a local enterprise. They had corporations in Emerald City and was a famous shipping company.</p><p>Why was Lina associated with this Hadwin Stephenson? What puzzled her more was that the man earlier had said that Hadwin captured her himself.</p><p>Did that mean that Hadwin Stephenson was actually in the Maybach she saw today?</p><p>She thought her best friend had been kidnapped, but now it seemed to be a different case.</p><p>&quot;Then... I&#x27;ll go find her!&quot; Grace turned sharply, intending to follow the address she had just heard to find her best friend.</p><p>&quot;Do you think you can get in there?&quot; Jason said lightly.</p><p>&quot;...&quot; Grace suddenly stopped in her tracks and hesitated before saying, &quot;Then... I&#x27;ll talk to the police first and ask them to take me with them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In that case, I can guarantee 100% that you won&#x27;t get in.&quot; Jason smiled gently and slowly walked up to Grace. As though looking at a naive child, he said, &quot;Do you know what Hadwin Stephenson is like? There are 100 ways he can keep you from seeing your friends.&quot;</p><p>Grace naturally did not know what Hadwin Stephenson was like, so she could only look at the man in front of her.</p><p>Jason explained. &quot;Hadwin was originally an illegitimate child of the Stephenson family who was left abroad. His father had a lot of sons. Many of them were born out of wedlock, only two of them weren’t. How do you think a bastard who was not taken seriously could get to where he is now?&quot;</p><p>Grace&#x27;s heart sank. Jason did not say much, but she more or less understood what Hadwin Stephenson was like.</p><p>A bastard like him could not become as successful as he was now without some scheming.</p><p>When she was a lawyer, she had also heard about how some rich families would fight over property as well as some of the means and dark secrets that were unimaginable to ordinary people.</p><p>Grace looked at Jason. &quot;Then... can you help me?&quot;</p><p>He glanced at her. &quot;Hadwin won&#x27;t kill your friend.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know, but...&quot; Grace bit her lip. She was still worried. She would only feel at ease when she saw Lina and found out why Hadwin had taken her. &quot;You can help me meet Hadwin and get to the bottom of this.&quot;</p><p>She knew only too well what the name Jason meant in Emerald City.</p><p>He was the only person she could ask for help from. If he would just help her...</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. She was begging him just for Lina.</p><p>She had also begged him in front of the police station earlier. It was as if she could do just about anything for Lina.</p><p>Just because Lina always helped her with her case? His mind flashed through the words she had spoken of Lina.</p><p>She was now begging him for Lina because... Lina was her lifeline? A lifeline she could not let go?</p><p>&quot;Yes, I can take you to Hadwin, but... why should I help you? I&#x27;ve helped you find out Lina&#x27;s whereabouts, and I&#x27;ve also told you that Lina is not in any danger. I&#x27;m a businessman, so I&#x27;m not going to do anything that’ll cause me a loss over and over again,&quot; Jason said darkly.</p><p>Grace bit her lip as her face grew pale. What could she give him for his help?</p></div>
