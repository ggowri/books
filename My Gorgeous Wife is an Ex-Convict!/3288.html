        <h1>Chapter 3286</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I've been watching you for a while now. Are you an actor?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man remained silent for a moment before nodding and saying, "Yes, I am an actor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, "I hope that one day you can achieve your own dreams. The hardest thing in this world is perseverance." She could see the disappointment in the other person's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This reminded her of when she first decided to pursue a career as a professional comic artist. She was once full of confidence and ambition, but also experienced setbacks. Therefore, she wanted to encourage the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, she genuinely found the other person's performance interesting. It's just that because it was a holiday today, many people didn't pay attention to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," the other person said, then suddenly raised their hand and took off their hat, removing the white beard attached to their face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a handsome face with well-defined features appeared before Valda's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blinked and recognized the person - it was Kering! She remembered Lina mentioning this actor when they were playing cards together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She debuted at 18 and is only 22 now. Recently, she has become very popular due to the success of her TV drama. It is said that her access to film and TV resources has increased significantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Last time, Lina mentioned about going to the film and television city together to chase after stars in the future! However, unexpectedly, Kering has now appeared right in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Valda was surprised, several cameras suddenly rushed out from the side, along with a person holding a microphone, and several others who appeared to be staff members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person holding the microphone said, "Congratulations, you have become the lucky guests of our show 'Dreams Fulfilled' and will receive a gift from our production team. Do you have anything to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blinked her eyes, feeling a bit dazed, while Brian furrowed his brow slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on? Lucky guest?" Valda asked her husband, turning her head to look at him for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Program teams may use special methods to engage passersby in interactive activities," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So..." Valda looked at Kering again. Was his street performance earlier also part of the show?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kering said, "Thank you for your encouragement earlier. I'm also happy to announce that you've become the lucky guest of the show. Apart from the gifts prepared by the production team, I would like to invite you and your family and friends to my movie premiere in a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kering sincerely extends an invitation, which is not part of the original program schedule, but rather a personal invitation from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He has always been confident in his acting skills, believing that among his peers, he is very talented and can even compare to those veteran actors. Many directors have praised his quick learning ability, especially in the past year where he has been able to nail his performances in one take.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In addition, with increasing popularity and a growing fan base, everyone seems to be praising his acting skills, causing him to become conceited and believe that he is truly a great actor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, just now, when he was performing on the street while covering his true face, no one paid attention. At that moment, he suddenly felt that perhaps in the past, others paid more attention to his face than his acting skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only person who truly stopped to watch his performance and encouraged him to persevere was the woman in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was truly grateful to the other person for saying that his performance was interesting when his confidence was about to crumble.</p></div>
