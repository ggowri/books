        <h1>Chapter 1286</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins's smile stiffened, and he defended himself by saying, "I was stupid back then. Fathers and daughters don't have overnight feuds. It's inconvenient to talk here, why don't we go in first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins only wanted to talk after getting past Reed Residence's gates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I thought we&rsquo;ve already severed ties with each other? If you're only here to acknowledge me because of my marriage, then I can only tell you we can never be a family again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she and the man in front of her were related by blood, their so-called family affection had long been exhausted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins's expression changed. His old face looked a little embarrassed now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said to Jason, "Jay, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins was unwilling to let Grace walk away like this. He subconsciously wanted to rush over and grab his eldest daughter. However, with the security guards stopping him, he had no way to approach Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley saw this and quickly said, "Grace, even... Even if you won't acknowledge your father, at least ask someone to set your sister free. Stella was the one who persuaded her to do what she did! Now that you've married into the Reed family, you don't want the media to expose the fact that you have a sister in jail, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Evelyn? In jail? And it has something to do with Stella? What's going on here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason seemed to notice her confusion and said, "Evelyn also took part in the incident where you met Stella's ex-husband in the lounge. Later, Evelyn and Stella got together to collude once more. It was Evelyn who came up with the plot to involve Chase Harper for Stella."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. She had no idea there were so many twists and turns involved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stella thought Evelyn would only work with her to deal with you but did not realize that Evelyn was also plotting against her. The video that was shown at Stella's birthday party was from the pinhole camera Evelyn had installed in her car. Evelyn originally intended to use it to control Stella."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you know so..." Grace's voice suddenly stopped and then she said, "Did you... ask someone to play the video at Stella's birthday party?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he had once told her that he could help her find evidence that could help Chase Harper in his case. However, the police ended up releasing Chase Harper because of the video shown at Stella's birthday party, so she never mentioned it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect him to have done everything silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, are you satisfied with it?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you!" Grace only found her heart feeling warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Melinda Riley heard Jason telling Grace this, she quickly said, "No, that's not it. Luoyin was... She was afraid that Stella might do something against Grace, so she installed the pinhole camera. She... She was going to hand it over to the police in a few days!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her stammering words exposed her guilty conscience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her stepmother in front of her and said coldly, "The police will investigate whether or not Evelyn had colluded with Stella and if she framed others. They&rsquo;ll also look into what was going on with the camera. You can find Evelyn a lawyer if you want her to be acquitted!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley secretly loathed this. They had no money to hire a lawyer. Besides, the facts of her daughter's crime could be any clearer.</p></div>
