        <h1>Chapter 2692</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who did you call?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a restaurant owned by Hart Group. It's open 24 hours a day," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, someone delivered porridge and several side dishes to the ward 20 minutes later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you going to eat?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not hungry. Go ahead," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated no more. After all, she was very hungry. She ate the porridge with the side dishes, which tasted extraordinarily delicious at four in the morning. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Valda Theller. It was only a simple bowl of porridge and some side dishes, but she enjoyed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He murmured, "Are you always so easily satisfied? You&rsquo;re even eating the porridge like you&rsquo;re having a feast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's because everything tastes superb when you're hungry," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about life? Are you content with your current life?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm quite content with it." She smiled. "I can do something I love and make money to support myself. I have extra money to set up my savings for retirement too. It's much better than what I had before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Better than what you had?" Brian chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? Are you content?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ward instantly fell silent again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller awkwardly said, "Uhh... Did I ask the wrong question? I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian shook his head. "It's nothing. I just don't know what's contentment." He had everything he wanted since he was a child. He had no idea what it felt like to feel content or discontent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, he kept looking for Grace but failed. He was not content at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had failed to get what he wanted all these years. He felt like there was a hole in his heart he could never fill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I can't get what I want, maybe I'll never feel content." He laughed at himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked blankly at him, and a voice in her head shouted, 'Don't ask. It's not your place to ask!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not help asking, "What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His phoenix eyes gazed at her. Just when she thought he would not answer, his thin lips slowly said, "I don't want that someone to worry. I want her to be reassured. I'm willing to do anything to ensure that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller instantly could not take her eyes off Brian's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he talking about the woman he loves?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He loves her so deeply. How many people in this world are able to love someone that deeply?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
