        <h1>Chapter 2682</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the film studio in Emerald City was the largest in the country. More than 70 percent of the country's films were shot here. If these actors were not allowed to enter the film studio, it was tantamount to killing their acting careers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's too much. Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the actors who went on strike with Queenie Mack today immediately panicked. They only did that to please Queenie Mack. After all, rumors had it that she had a powerful backer. If they got on her good side, perhaps they could get some resources from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They did not expect it to turn out like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's because the film studio belongs to the Hart family." Estelle Rowe once again silenced the voices with one statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Estelle Rowe ignored the others and only asked her men to pick up Valda Theller so that she could quickly be sent to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was stunned, unable to believe her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought Valda was in serious trouble this time, but someone came to Valda's rescue!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides that... it was a group of people that came to her rescue!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on here? Why did the executive assistant rescue Valda? It's evident that the woman's helping Valda.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland had too many questions on her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Estelle Rowe left with Valda Theller, many of the actors involved in the strike rushed to Queenie Mack and asked, "Miss Mack, now what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We went on strike because you told us to, but now, we're not allowed to step into the film studio. How are we going to star in films in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Mack, you gotta help us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack was already flustered when she was surrounded by this bunch of people. Just as she was ready to squeeze out of the crowd to leave, the extras knocked down to the floor by Estelle Rowe's men shouted too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Mack, we did what you told us to do. Assault? We didn't do it on purpose. Don't let the police arrest us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Mack, didn't you say you have a lot of connections? Even if something does happen, you gotta fix it! You gotta help us deal with it when the police come!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You asked us to do this. You said Valda Theller annoyed you and asked us to take off her clothes. We told you it was inappropriate, but you just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more these people spoke, the more Queenie Mack was exposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in the film crew instantly understood what had happened earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people thought the extras lost control and stopped faking it. However, it turned out to be real in the first place. They even planned to take off her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack was the mastermind of all this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people immediately looked at Queenie Mack with disapproval. Some even rejoiced in her misfortune. After all, Queenie Mack had always been arrogant, and many people disliked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The producer was already overwhelmed by the chaos. If everyone involved in today's strike was banned from the film studio, the producer would either have to replace these actors or move elsewhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gosh, how did this happen? The producer felt like killing themselves!</p></div>
