        <h1>Chapter 3130</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you give me a chance? Just one chance! Even if it's just for the sake of our child!" He stared at her intensely, his eyes filled with pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, he thought that in this lifetime, he would never again ask for anyone's help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he's begging again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he asks for is another chance from the woman he loves the most in his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"George, I am now Herman's wife. Don't you think it's rude to say such things to me?" Amber said sternly, trying hard to pull her hand back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His five fingers were tightly clasping her hand, refusing to loosen even a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this about Herman? He's already dead. Besides, his so-called wife has no legal support. Are you really planning to be a widow for a dead man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dead?" Amber suddenly sneered, "Maybe he's dead to you, but to me, he's still alive, always living in my heart. As long as I believe that I am his wife, then I am his wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, George felt a chill run through his body. As she spoke those words, her gaze was fixed on him, but it felt as if she was looking at a lifeless body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Herman is dead, but for her, he is still alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And though he is alive, for her, it is as if he is already dead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you used to love me, didn't you?" he growled, his voice filled with so much resentment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, it's true that you were the one I loved before, but just because I loved you doesn't mean that things can't change. Some love can grow from nothing, while others can fade away from something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So even if it's gone now, it can come back again! Amber, I can definitely make you fall in love with me again! You are Simon's mother, and originally, you should have been my wife!" He said urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly laughed, laughing so hard that tears were about to come out. "George, you said you want me to fall in love with you again? Impossible, it will never happen!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why is it impossible? I can make up for it, I'll do everything in my power to make it up to you!" He frowned, her smile only made him more uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She raised the other hand that he didn't catch. At this moment, that hand wasn't wearing a glove, and the empty ring finger looked so heart-wrenching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's like my chopped off finger that can never grow back, I can never fall in love with you again!" She said it with such firmness and determination, and looking at him, her gaze was resolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The color drained from his face in an instant, leaving him incredibly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her fingers... it's because of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he made the mistake of believing Louise Mitchell years ago, he let jealousy consume his rationality, and allowed her to suffer in a mental hospital without trying to save her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All of this is because of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." His lips trembled slightly as he kept apologizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her gaze remained cold and indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So from now on, I hope you won't say these meaningless words to me again. I am Simon's mother, but I will never be your wife! Please leave, you are not welcome here!" She gave him an ultimatum.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even for Simon's sake, don't you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want to lose myself for Simon!" Amber said, "As a mother, I can sacrifice a lot for my child, but not my marriage and my self. I hope you won't step into my room again in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George let go of her hand in a daze, and he became extremely despondent. Even his eyes lost their luster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps... he had already lost her completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As early as the day when he decided to let her stay in the mental hospital and not ask about her, he had already lost her!</p></div>
