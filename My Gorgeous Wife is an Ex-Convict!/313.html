        <h1>Chapter 312</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's red face turned pale. Her lips trembled, and all she could say was "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was the one who said those words, and she was the one who failed to do as she promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You screwed me up," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was once again silence in the car. She did not know how long it took until the car finally stopped. Lina followed Hadwin out of the car only to find that it was the same mansion he had brought her to yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could not help stopping in her tracks at the thought of her being locked up inside last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, are you afraid to go in?" Hadwin turned his head to look at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tugged at the corners of her mouth, trying to force out a smile. "We can just talk outside. It's all the same."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin gave a half-smile and said, "Lina, I have many ways to keep you here if I want to, and I can guarantee that it won&rsquo;t be easy for Jason to save you this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. She hesitated for a moment before gritting her teeth. Who cared? If he was going to hurt her, with her current state, she could not even stop him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina then stepped a few steps forward with vigorous strides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin smiled faintly and stepped forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the two entered the mansion, Hadwin pointed to a couch and said, "Sit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina sat down obediently as if she was possessed by a primary school student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin walked over to the bar and began mixing drinks. Soon, a rainbow cocktail appeared in his hands. Then he held the glass and walked up to her. "Here, I remember that you used to enjoy this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, she was indeed guilty. The alcohol from back then tasted like fruit wine, so she thought it would not be too strong. Who knew she would be drunk enough to do that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, she would not be so awkward with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, thank you. I'm not thirsty." She smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his eyebrows. "I worked hard to make you this. Will you really not drink it?&rdquo; He took her right hand and pushed the glass into hers, almost forcing her to hold it. "I didn't bother to learn mixology because I wasn't going to be a bartender, but I learned it over the years. I only know how to make this, though. Isn't it funny?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina listened on, not knowing what to say. The cocktail in her hand seemed to get heavier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You still won't drink it?" he asked as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her lips. Fine, she would drink it. The worst that could happen was her getting drunk, and&hellip; he could just take his revenge, but&hellip; "What's going on between us has nothing to do with my parents. You can take out your anger on me any way you want, but don't bother my parents."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her. She looked like she was going to risk everything and get it over with. Then, his thin lips spat out the words, "All right".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina threw back her head and drank the cocktail in one gulp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the same drink, but she felt completely different. Why did she think it tasted so good back then but so bitter now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it good?" he asked, looking at her intently.</p></div>
