        <h1>Chapter 2541</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of driving away in the car he came in, he walked down the street in a daze. He did not even know where he was going.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the road ahead of him was dark, and perhaps it was the end of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What had he done?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to forget about Grace but could not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to keep her safe but could do nothing when she was in danger. He could only watch her put herself into a dangerous situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she told him that she would give birth to the child at such a price just because it was her and Jason&rsquo;s baby, his heart filled with endless sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... the obvious answer, was it not? He had long understood that the person she loved could only be Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To her, he was nothing more than a childhood friend who had gone through thick and thin with her. He was nothing more than a friend to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had always been a one-sided crush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that, but why did he still feel so bad? It was almost as if he was about to suffocate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was suddenly the muffled sound of thunder in the sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People on the streets either took out umbrellas or rushed to a place not far away to seek shelter from the rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Brian continued to walk slowly as if nothing mattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Drip, drip!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bean-sized raindrops began to fall from the sky, landing on his head, face, and body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The raindrops became increasingly dense. It seemed to hurt when they hit the body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he hoped that the rain could hurt him even more. Perhaps he would forget the pain in his heart if it hurt more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Swoosh!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It started raining cats and dogs. Those without umbrellas scurried for shelter, but Brian continued to walk slowly in the rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Where should I go?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Where should I go without Grace in my life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How should I live my life?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, he stopped when an umbrella was held over his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked up blankly at the floral umbrella over his head that temporarily shielded him from the rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he turned around, he saw an unfamiliar female face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only glanced at her faintly before continuing to walk forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To his surprise, the umbrella continued to follow him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned around, and his dark phoenix eyes saw the woman following behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a young woman with a round apple face. She had round deer-like eyes, long hair that was in a simple ponytail, a delicate nose, and lips of moderate thickness. She was wearing simple casual clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Brian's opinion, such a woman was ordinary. He had seen all sorts of women in the entertainment industry. Many beautiful women had even tried to get close to him.</p></div>
