        <h1>Chapter 2747</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, Grace will be relieved if I can fall in love with Valda Theller. I won't be stuck in a hopeless relationship again, and my parents will be relieved too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But can I really fall in love with the woman in front of me? She doesn't annoy me, and I even find my time with her relaxing.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at Brian with a shocked gaze. She thought Brian would give up on the idea after she said this. She did not expect him to... say so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What did you say? You want to date me while considering marriage?" she asked, finding her voice slightly out of tune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he answered confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want me to... love you? Will you love me too?" she asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I will try to fall for you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But can you fall for me?" She was doubtful. After all, he was so in love with Grace. Could he fall for another person?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke honestly, "I don't know. I don't know if I can fall in love with you. It&rsquo;ll be a gamble for you and me. No one can predict the outcome."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller bit her lip. She could not believe that Brian agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was glad he said that now. Yeah, no one knew what would happen in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cold voice said, "Valda Theller, do you want to love me? Let's be a real couple. Make me fall in love with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thump! Thump! Thump! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could hear her heart beating very clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Should I refuse? Or agree?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can I really make this man fall for me? Can I get him to move on?' She gazed at him deeply. After a long pause, she heard her voice reply, "Well, we're a real couple now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only because... she did not want to lose him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After dinner, Valda Theller was still deep in trance even though Brian had left the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I really dating... Brian now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No more acting, but a real relationship? Brian even promised to try to fall for me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at her red face in the mirror after walking into the bathroom. She took a deep breath and said to herself, "Come on. Let's fight... for this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Let's fight for this relationship!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew she had fallen for Brian. She had never felt this emotion again after Raymond Bowman hurt her.</p></div>
