        <h1>Chapter 3483</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough, how did they escape?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I don't know. They knocked me out, and I blacked out and didn't know anything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How long ago did they escape?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No...I don't know, I wasn't paying attention to the time," he said as he stumbled out, having just woken up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's search the nearby area first. It shouldn't take long, and they are two girls who can't go far in this deserted place!" said the leader, and the others agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As these people were about to go search for Veronica and Jasper, one of them said, "What about that kid Lionel? Did we take care of him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Keep it for now, it might come in handy later," said the leader. "Let's go find someone and leave someone here to guard it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After everyone left the warehouse, Lionel finally breathed a sigh of relief. At least he was still alive for the time being. However, if no one came to rescue him, he would really be done for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person who stayed behind here is the one who was injured just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel stared at the other person. This guy actually tried to hit on his sister just now. It seems like he didn't succeed. If he had succeeded, even if Lionel was rescued, Mason would probably break his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of Mason's violent behavior, Lionel felt scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bandit, whose head was only roughly bandaged, was already in a terrible mood. When Lionel gave him a stern look, he became even more angry. "What are you staring at? Your sister is lucky to have me. When the boss catches her and brings her back, I'll have her right in front of you. You and your sister can just wait and see..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person was kicking Lionel hard while cursing at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel is in excruciating pain, but unfortunately, his hands and feet are tied up, so he can't do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the corner of his eye caught something and his expression slightly changed. However, he quickly resumed loudly screaming in pain, even more exaggerated than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The kidnapper who was fiercely kicking Lionel started using even more foul language. Suddenly, a hand forcefully grabbed his neck, preventing him from making any sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And then, a bone-chilling voice sounded, "Asking for death!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just these two simple words, but they instill fear in people. Then, a handsome and pretty face with a hint of femininity appeared in the eyes of the kidnapper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is... Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Previously, Lionel had shown them a photo of Mason, so he was able to recognize him at a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Mason, after all, is just a young boy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could a young boy give off such a terrifying vibe! Especially with those eyes, as if he has no reverence for life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the kidnapper himself is not a good person and wouldn't hesitate to kill someone, he was still scared by Mason's gaze in that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gaze of this young man is so terrifying that it sends shivers down one's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person's fingers are like steel bars around his neck, making it hard for him to breathe. The feeling of death is becoming stronger and stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Lionel who was just beaten up had the cloth gag in his mouth loosened due to the beating.</p></div>
