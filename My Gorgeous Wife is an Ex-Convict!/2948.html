        <h1>Chapter 2946</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No matter how many points are still missing, I want to give it a try and see if we can fill it up. Brian Hart, would you like to join me in filling up these points? If...you are still willing, then let's continue walking and see if you can fall in love with me in this lifetime! I want to know the result!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On his lips was the warmth of her fingertips. In this moment, the woman spoke to him with a resolute expression and said these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I would love to!" He suddenly hugged her, burying his head in the crook of her neck, breathing in her scent. This time, the feeling of embracing her was so reassuring. "Valda, let's move forward together. I will fall in love with you, I'm sure of it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She opened her arms and carefully hugged him back, making a soft "Mmm" sound from her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian, do you know how much I love you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Do you know that standing in front of you today, I need to have a lot of confidence in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps the future is full of obstacles, but she still wants to give it another try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because she also believed that he liked her so much...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the villa, Valda watched as Brian slowly took off his shirt, revealing his skin underneath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed for a moment and bit her lip slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want to see?" his voice echoed in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well...I have seen it before," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid you won't like it, after all, this isn't something that looks good," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want to see how it is now, can you show me?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So he finally took off his shirt completely, and suddenly, the wound on his waist and abdomen appeared before her eyes once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She has seen this wound many times, watching as the doctor carefully stitched it up and the nurse tended to it every day. Now, it doesn't look as glaring as it did at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The color of the stitches on the wound seems to have darkened a bit, and it has already scabbed over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really not need any medicine for this injury?" Valda leaned in close to his face and stared at his wound, asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need, actually the wound is already healing and all we have to do is wait for the scab to fall off. The stitches used to close the wound are also self-dissolving, so there's no need to remove them." He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instinctively wanted to reach out her finger to touch his wound, but then she quickly withdrew her hand, apparently wanting to touch it but not daring to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He saw her concern and immediately took her hand, placing it on his wound. "It has already scabbed over, so even if you touch it like this, it won't hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On her fingertips, there was a thin scab. "Are you really not in pain anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't hurt," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know if this scar will be very noticeable in the future," she murmured. This scar on his body was like a beautiful piece of art with a crack in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And this crack, it was caused by her and no one else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you think it looks ugly, then after a few days when it scabs over, I can go get a scar removal treatment," Brian said. "But personally, I quite like it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like it?" She blinked her eyes in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"For men, getting injured is like a badge of honor," he said, slowly lowering his head and gently resting his forehead against hers. "Fortunately, you didn't get hurt that day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, the knife landed on him instead. If it had landed on her, she would have been in a lot of pain.</p></div>
