        <h1>Chapter 2722</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart has given me his instructions. Please come with me, Miss Theller," the staff member said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller followed her to the fitting room, which was a large hall. Expensive beautifully-made gowns were on both sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she led Valda Theller into the innermost past without stopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The gowns displayed inside were far classier than the ones outside. They looked exquisite as they used a lot of beautiful pearls and gems.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Theller, Mr. Hart said you can choose anything you want. He&rsquo;ll buy it for you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze. "Buy? Aren't these for rent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff member smiled. "These gowns aren't for rent. They're usually bought after being selected."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated and said, "Well... Wait a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff member nodded. Valda Theller walked to one side and dialed Brian's phone. The line soon connected, and Brian's voice sounded. "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I'm here at the shop, but the staff member who&rsquo;s serving me here said people buy them. Uhh... I'm just attending a banquet today. I can just rent one. It&rsquo;d be a waste to buy one," whispered Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't cost much. Just pick whatever you like and I'll pick you up later. Don't forget that you're my girlfriend now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze slightly before saying, "Alright... I'll just pick one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Putting away her phone, Valda Theller took a deep breath. 'Yes, I'm Brian's girlfriend. This dress is expensive to me, but it's nothing to him.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she would embarrass him if she dressed badly. They would make fun of him if they poked fun at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Valda Theller began to choose her gown carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, she chose a dark purple dress with roses made of crushed diamonds and white crystals at the hem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take this one," Valda Theller said to the staff member beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, follow me, please," the staff member said as she led Valda Theller into the fitting room, helped her put on the gown, and then began styling her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, Brian got prepared and went to the underground car park. His phone rang, and it was a phone call from Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He answered the phone and heard Patrick's voice on the other end of the line. "Are you bringing someone to the banquet today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," Brian answered indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who else would it be?" he asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today's banquet... Uh... As far as I know, Jason and Grace will be there too," Patrick said after hesitating for a moment. Speaking of which, Brian might have found a girlfriend, but he could not figure out how Brian felt about Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she just a temporary playmate or... was he serious about her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know that," said Brian. He wanted to attend the banquet with Valda Theller because he knew that. </p></div>
