        <h1>Chapter 3617</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them strolled through this wetland area, and when Jasper got a bit tired, they stopped at a dessert shop to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William stood in line to buy dessert for Jasper, while Jasper found a seat and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seat she was sitting in was an outdoor area near the entrance of the dessert shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And right next to the roadside, there was a street performer who happened to be playing the violin, and in front of that person, the violin case was open, with quite a bit of loose change inside. Some passersby would take out all their money and put it in this violin case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper himself was a music student, so he could immediately tell the other person's level of skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other person's skill level is not particularly good, but in this environment, it's not bad to drink and listen to music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William bought a drink and returned to Jasper's side, handing her a cup of beverage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if this person can play Jules Massenet's Tha&iuml;s," Jasper said while sipping her drink. She quite enjoys listening to this piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go ask," William said, standing up and walking towards the street performer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to have a conversation, and then William took out a hundred-dollar bill and placed it in the performer's violin case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper initially thought the performer was going to play, but to her surprise, the performer </span><span>handed the violin to William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William then set up the violin and started playing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper blinked her eyes. William was actually playing the violin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she knew he had learned to play the violin and had performed for her several times before, he had gradually shifted his focus to studying after giving up the piano, so naturally, he practiced the violin less often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it sounded like he was playing the violin quite well. At least, his rendition of Tha&iuml;s was beautiful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was immersed in the melody, and when she met William's gaze, she felt as if his eyes contained the vastness of the stars and the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As William played, many people passing by stopped in their tracks and listened to his performance. There were even young girls with stars in their eyes, full of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper had often seen this kind of look on other girls' faces throughout her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, William was a guy who attracted girls, especially when he played. That kind of allure became even more evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the piece ended, William returned the violin to the street performer and seemingly said thank you before returning to Jasper's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must not have practiced the violin in a long time to be able to play so well without making any mistakes," Jasper said in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, I do practice occasionally. Besides, the pieces I practice are just a few, and Tha&iuml;s happens to be one of the ones I practice often. Since you wanted to listen, I played it for you," William replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper smiled sweetly, suddenly feeling cherished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like every time she needed something, he would try his best to fulfill her wishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they returned to school, Jasper noticed that many students along the way were whispering and pointing at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper immediately felt a sense of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, William remained calm and after walking Jasper to the dormitory building, he said to her, "Alright, you go rest in your room first."</span></p></div>
