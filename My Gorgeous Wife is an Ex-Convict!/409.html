        <h1>Chapter 408</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, who could have done it? Grace's first thought was Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Brian had the right to delete these videos, and it would not be easy for just anyone to delete all relevant content so quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, on the other hand, was in front of his computer watching a video playing on the screen with a grim look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace would have cried in surprise if she saw this video. It was the video Kyla Corbyn had mentioned but was already deleted from the internet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason watched the video quietly, his eyes darkening when he saw Brian going down on one knee to tie Grace's shoelace. His fingers on the table tightened almost subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He and Brian had known each other for a long time. He came into contact with Brian after he returned to the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Reed family's relationship with the Hart family had always been pretty good, so his relationship with Brian was also pretty good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, in their social circle, if there was no conflict of interest, then making a friend was better than making an enemy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if this friend might not be sincere, but at least they were friends on the surface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he was familiar with Brian and knew how proud Brian was. Other than the one in his heart, the other women were just decorations. They were probably substitutes for the person in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person in Brian's heart... Jason's thin lips tightened when he saw the way Brian looked at Grace in the video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian probably did not know that Grace was the one he was looking for yet! If he knew, he might have done a lot more for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had not seen photos of Grace as a child, he would never have thought that Grace was the girl Brian was searching for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he would not let Brian know that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace would only be Jason's. She would only be with him for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence who was at the side was now glimpsing nervously at his superior. Young Master Reed was so silent and sullen that it was rather frightening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Young Master Reed had seen this video countless times and he was still staring at it. Could Young Master Reed be... Terrence dared not think of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if Young Master Reed got angry, the entire Emerald City would probably tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't let any of the people who embarrassed Grace today go unpunished," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Terrence replied immediately, relieved that Young Master Reed only wanted to punish the people who embarrassed Miss Cummins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that Young Master Reed would act on impulse and go straight to Master Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the Reed family and Hart family got into a conflict, it would not just affect the two families but also a lot of people. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason once again spoke and made Terrence's newly relieved heart panic all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me..." Although Jason was speaking to Terrence, his gaze remained fixed on the computer screen. "Will Grace like men like Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence almost choked as he hastily said, "Miss Cummins is now your girlfriend, Young Master Reed. She won&rsquo;t like Master Hart."</p></div>
