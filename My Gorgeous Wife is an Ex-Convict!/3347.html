        <h1>Chapter 3345</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace knows that over the years, Veronica hasn't really made any friends, and Mason is definitely involved in this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this is unfair to Veronica. As she grows older, she will also have the need to make friends and cannot revolve her life around Mason forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Mason continues to see Veronica, it will create conflicts as he can only treat one person well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you not worry?" Lina asked. "This can't go on like this. Veronica is already 12 years old. In two more years, she could start dating early."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's not uncommon for middle and high school students to have romantic relationships nowadays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Worrying, but there's really no other way," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How about taking Mason to see a psychologist?" Lina suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We've been there, but Mason is very resistant, so it's not really helpful," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina sighed at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, "Maybe in a couple of years, the child will change. People's growth often happens in a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's true. Anyway, we just need to guide him more in these two years," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three women changed the topic and started talking about Lina's future son-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Mason is quiet because of his introverted personality and difficulty in communicating with others, then Chandler is quiet simply because he's too lazy to talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he does speak, he's definitely part of the sarcastic group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For example, when Tina saw the baby not crying, she wondered, "Why isn't she crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler simply spat out the word "stupid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, he meant it for Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Tina was used to Chandler's way of speaking and continued to ask, "Why isn't she crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler rolled his eyes, but still began to explain the reason for not crying to Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, Tina became impatient and pulled Jasper to play with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Jasper could say anything, Chandler suddenly said, "Wait, Tina, your hair is loose!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hair?" Tina blinked her eyes and then went straight to Chandler's side, and Chandler actually took out a small comb from his pocket and started to re-braid Tina's hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda, who was not far away, was stunned, "Uh, your future son-in-law, will... braid hair?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina had a conflicted expression on her face, one that was both proud and helpless. "Yes, she can. She can even braid hair better than me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Speaking of it, having a future son-in-law who is handy is nice, but if his handiness makes your own daughter look down on her mother's skills, it can be quite disheartening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially when it comes to being handy, Chandler is quite skilled. However, his mouth has a tendency to anger people to no end, which makes Lina's feelings towards him quite complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler's hair combing skills were very proficient, indicating that he often combed Tina's hair. In no time at all, he had finished combing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper and Mick weren't particularly surprised to see each other, as they had previously met before at the Stephenson family's place, where they both frequented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was surprised and widened her eyes, "You...you're really good at braiding hair." she exclaimed in shock.</p></div>
