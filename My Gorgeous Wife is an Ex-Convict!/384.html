        <h1>Chapter 383</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's fine here!" Grace said quickly. The cemetery plot he had chosen for her mother was in a separate spot in the cemetery, not in line with the rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If one were to describe them as houses, the rows and rows of tombs were apartments while the tomb he had chosen was like a mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a small independent space surrounded by a row of trees. There were even stone tables and chairs a few meters in front of the tomb for visitors to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great. Then you can put your mother's ashes in," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded, stooped down, and placed her mother's cinerary casket in the hole in front of the tombstone where the ashes were kept. Then, the workers covered it with the slate and poured cement over it to seal it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cemetery staff presented Grace with a contract for the cemetery. It was a one-time contract for 50 years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace saw that the cost was a huge amount. Even before her incident, she might not have been able to afford such an expensive cemetery plot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed has paid for all the expenses. You just need to sign here, Miss Cummins," said the cemetery staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew she owed Jason another big favor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Biting her lip slightly, she took the pen and signed her name. After all, it was not the time to worry about her remaining pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the cemetery staff and workers left, Jason asked Terrence to bring out incense as well as the fruits and food for worship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have not paid your respects to your mother today. You can do it now." As he spoke, he stooped down and laid out the candles, food, and fruits. Then, he took out a lighter and lit the candles. Finally, he lit another bunch of incense and gave her three of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the incense and stared at the tombstone where her mother now laid. Her heart was at last at rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if her mother had passed away, she now had a resting place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace respectfully bowed three times to the tombstone, putting all her longing for her mother at the bottom of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, I'll visit you again this winter solstice, and I'll come every day after that. I won't keep you waiting anymore," muttered Grace. "Mom, if you&rsquo;re hearing this, please bless me so I can find out the truth of the car accident and clear my name one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes darkened when he heard Grace's last remark, and his hands trembled slightly as he held the incense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace placed the incense sticks in front of her mother's grave, Jason followed closely. He held the incense sticks and bowed three times toward Grace's mother's grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This startled Terrence and the bodyguards who were still in front of the grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was... Was Young Master Reed bowing to Miss Cummins's mother? Even if it was normal to respect the dead, but... this was Young Master Reed. How many other people in Emerald City had he bowed to?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace also looked at Jason in surprise, not expecting him to bow to her mother. "You..." she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's your mother. Of course, I should pay her my respects," Jason said, crouching down and planting the incense in front of the tombstone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not for this woman, she would not exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never know that there was someone that he wanted so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as though her heart was filled with an indescribable feeling. The moonlight fell on him as if he had been covered with a silvery chiffon veil.</p></div>
