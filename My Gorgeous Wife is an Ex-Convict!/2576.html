        <h1>Chapter 2574</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Turning around, he walked away from her door. However, he had only taken a few steps when he suddenly fell flat on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was pale, and he closed his eyes. He had seemingly fainted. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory only felt as though he had a very long dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the dream, he and Amber Mitchell were about to get married. Herman Moss had gone abroad. There was no accident, no suspicion, and Amber Mitchell was never admitted to a mental hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were still in love. Besides that, to his delight, she had gotten pregnant. A few months after their marriage, she gave birth to a boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were a happy family of three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dream was so beautiful that he was reluctant to wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once he woke up... what he had to face was the harsh reality!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George, George..." There was a voice calling his name!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Son, how did this happen all of a sudden? What's going on?" Someone was sobbing. It was his mother's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was time... to wake up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory slowly opened his eyes and saw his parents' faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Dad... Mom... What are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to you? Who did this to your hand? Did Amber Mitchell have someone break your hand?" Old Madam Gregory asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mention of Amber Mitchell made George Gregory's expression change suddenly. "Where's Amber Mitchell? W-Where is she? W-Why am I here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She sent you to the hospital, but now she's detained by the police at the police station," said Old Madam Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Detained? Why is she detained at the police station?" George Gregory asked hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's being held on suspicion of intentional injury!" Old Madam Gregory snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory's face turned paler as soon as she said this. He pulled off the thin blanket to get out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing? Stay in bed! They just got your fingers in a cast. It'll be all for nothing if you move. It'll affect your fingers' function!" Old Madam Gregory said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Gregory also pressed George Gregory's shoulder. "Listen to your mother and go back to the bed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I broke my fingers myself. Amber Mitchell has nothing to do with it. Even if she wanted to cripple my hands, I would&rsquo;ve willingly let her do it! I'm going to the police station to explain things!" George Gregory said. He could not let Amber Mitchell suffer any more injustice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it surprised Old Master Gregory and Old Madam Gregory as soon as he said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? You broke your fingers yourself?" The old couple looked at their son in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I broke them myself. Louise Mitchell cut off one of Amber Mitchell's fingers. Even if I break all five of my fingers, I still can't make up for that finger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the greatest pain to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... You..." Old Madam Gregory was so shocked that she was at a loss. She finally spoke after a long while, "Louise Mitchell cut off her... finger, not you. Why did you have to do this?"</p></div>
