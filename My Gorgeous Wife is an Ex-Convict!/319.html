        <h1>Chapter 318</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine, let's date," Lina said with resignation. Since she was going to be avenged on, she should at least be mentally prepared for it. "Then you&hellip; Uh, you can give me my phone back now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had not forgotten that the main reason she followed him to the mansion was to get her phone back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her for a moment, then threw the phone which was lying on the coffee table straight back to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" she exclaimed, catching her phone just in time. The phone cost her 10,000 dollars. She had bought it through gritted teeth. If it hit the ground and its screen broke, it would cost more than 2,000 dollars to fix.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It hurt to think about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it did break, she dared not ask him to pay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina turned on her phone and looked at the time. It was already past nine o&rsquo;clock, and there were several missed calls on her phone. They were all from her parents, so she immediately called them back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The call soon got through and there came her father's angry shout. "Won't you just give us a call if you're not coming back for dinner? You're not even answering your phone. What are you trying to do? Do you want us to go to the police again like yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina was sweating wildly. "I... I got tied up. I'll be right back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she hung up the phone quickly and looked at Hadwin who had walked over to her. With her father's loud voice, he probably heard what he just said to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, if there's nothing else, I got to go," Lina said rather lamely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take you home," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina hastened to say, "It's all right. I'll just take a taxi there. Besides&hellip; I have to pick up my car from yesterday's parking lot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he grabbed her wrist and firmly said, "I'll take you there. We're in a relationship now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina was rendered speechless. Fine, he could take her there if he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina stopped arguing and obediently followed Hadwin out the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The keys to your car," Hadwin said to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina looked confused but obediently took the car keys from her bag and handed them to Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin gave the car keys to the driver and told him to go to the place where Lina parked yesterday to get her car and drive it back to Lina's neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," the driver replied and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Hadwin got into the driver's seat and looked at Lina who stood dumbfounded beside the car. "Get in," he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh." Lina came back to her senses and hurriedly got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin was focused on driving throughout the journey, ignoring Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina had nothing to do, so she opened her phone, determined to set a new password. She felt as if he had seen a lot of the contents on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just when she was about to set a separate password for the video folder on her phone, she suddenly found that a lot of the videos on her phone seemed to be missing...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina hurriedly checked the videos in the folder and was shocked to find that the missing videos were all videos of her idols!</p></div>
