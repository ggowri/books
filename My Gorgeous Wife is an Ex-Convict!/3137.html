        <h1>Chapter 3135</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked up and saw a young woman wearing a pearl pink dress speaking, while two companions stood beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda knows this woman, Tracy Barlow, who is a rising star in the entertainment industry this year. She's been making headlines lately and is a wealthy and beautiful woman. Her family's business is well-known in Emerald City, and she's an only child who could have inherited the family business, but chose to pursue a career in entertainment instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, since she entered the entertainment industry, she has had very good natural resources, coupled with her sweet appearance, so she has gained a large number of fans in a very short period of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at the other person. Her woman's intuition told her that the other person's approach was not just a simple inquiry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I am Brian's fianc&eacute;e," she stood up and gracefully admitted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, this is really unbelievable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly, I thought Brian's girlfriend would be the stunning type that outshines everyone else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy's two companions behind her muttered, causing Valda to furrow her brows slightly. Tracy smiled and said, "Sorry, my friends can be a bit blunt. I hope you don't mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda faced the insincere smile on the other person's face. In the past, she might have just nodded and pretended nothing was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if you know the other person has bad intentions, it's not appropriate to confront them and ruin the relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, she doesn't want to continue being so weak. If she can be easily mocked by others, then in the future, that mockery will also be directed towards Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that she is Brian's fianc&eacute;e, they are inextricably linked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't think it's being straightforward, I just think it's rude. But since that's the case, why should I care?" Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she spoke, the three of them immediately changed their expressions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two women behind Tracy immediately said, "Who do you think you are? You're neither a socialite nor a popular star. What makes you think you're worthy of standing next to Brian? If it weren't for Brian, you wouldn't even be able to attend tonight's banquet!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, "Who am I, and who are you to decide whether I'm worthy or not to be with Brian? Do you have the qualifications to make that decision?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This speech immediately silenced the two of them, their faces turning red as they glared at Valda with hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy pretended to be a good person and said, "I'm sorry, please don't mind what my friend said. We were just curious. We heard that Brian had a girlfriend before, but she disappeared. Brian has been looking for her, and we didn't expect her to show up today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was said that she disappeared unexpectedly, but who knows if there was something shady going on and she disappeared on purpose!" One of Tracy's female companions behind her spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy hurriedly said, "How can you say that! How could someone disappear on purpose!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who knows, otherwise let her explain why she disappeared!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy turned to Valda and said, "Why don't we explain it? To be honest, I'm also very curious. I'm sure it's not just us who are curious. If we don't explain, it will only lead to more speculation. It's better to be open and clear about the situation. This way, people won't be suspicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is not foolish. The other person is saying this openly, but in reality, they just want to know the specific details of her disappearance and want to manipulate the situation to their advantage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her disappearance is not just a personal matter for her, it also involves many other people.</p></div>
