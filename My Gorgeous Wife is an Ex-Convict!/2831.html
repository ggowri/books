        <h1>Chapter 2829</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you choose a new outfit? I'll prepare the jewelry for you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. It&rsquo;ll be a waste to get a new one. I don't often wear gowns and jewelry either," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're going to need them more in the future, so you might as well have more," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze, thinking he was implying something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After dinner, Valda Theller and Brian went to the lakeside for a walk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The night breeze blew past them. It was comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were many couples by the lakeside. Valda Theller could not help but envy the couples walking hand in hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had held hands with Brian before, she was usually the one taking the initiative to do with while he just agreed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never have held her hand when they were alone if she did not mention it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he said he liked her... the affection was probably far from the love between lovers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's eyes fell on the couples' intertwined hands from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Valda Theller froze and looked blankly at her right hand. Another hand was holding her right hand... It was Brian's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He asked in reply, "Don't you want to? I thought you were looking at other people's hands because you wanted to hold hands too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed but admitted it anyway, "Yeah, I do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let&rsquo;s go on, then," he said, intending to continue walking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" she said suddenly. She leaned over as she wrapped her free arm around his waist and buried her face in his arms. "Thank you for playing along with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She murmured, trying to get some things off her chest while she had the courage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She muttered, "You said you like me yesterday, and I'm glad. Even if it might not be love yet, at least it's a silver lining for me. When I fantasize about you, kiss you, and touch you, you&rsquo;d say it doesn&rsquo;t matter because we're a couple, so it's natural to do these things. But you know what? I think it's natural for people who love each other to do these things not just because they're a couple."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He listened in silence. He could feel her body stiffening as she spoke. Her fingers seemed to tighten around his as they continued to hold hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She continued, "Though you said you don't hate it when I do this, I don't think it's pleasant to have someone you don't love do this to you. I've only wanted us to be closer and more intimate that I forgot I'm the only one happy when doing these."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was what she felt when she watched the couples pass by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The couples were beaming when they did something intimate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had never seen such a look on Brian's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly found herself a little ridiculous when she thought of how she was secretly delighted to be more intimate with him.</p></div>
