        <h1>Chapter 3704</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, those eyes suddenly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Don't...don't go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save her... save her... those eyes are her last hope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a burst of strength that seemed to come from nowhere, Veronica pushed Crispin away as he tried to pull her into the elevator. She stumbled towards Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When everyone was caught off guard, Veronica hugged Mason from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason froze in place and the people around him stopped too, turning their attention to the unexpected scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save... save me..." Veronica's voice was broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason slowly turned around and looked down at Veronica, who was still hugging him. "You want me to save you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save... save me..." She struggled to focus her gaze on his dark eyes, pleading with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at her with mixed emotions. He had been wary when she tried to hug him earlier, and with his skills, he could have easily avoided her embrace. But in the end, he let her hug him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What nonsense are you spouting, woman!" Crispin's sudden outburst interrupted them. He tried to pull Veronica away from Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Mason gave him a cold stare, Crispin's hand froze in mid-air. He felt a sense of familiarity in Mason's face, as if he had seen him somewhere before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your relationship with her?" Mason asked in a cold voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's my girlfriend, we were just going back to our room!" Crispin regained his composure and reached out to Veronica again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Mason waved his hand and pushed Crispin away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little punk..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crispin was interrupted by a voice beside him before he could finish speaking. "Crispin, what are you talking about? This is Mason from the Reed family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crispin was startled and realized that one of the people he was talking to was actually a relative he knew, someone who had business dealings with his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment, this relative was just standing on the side, giving him a disapproving look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason from the Reed family, could this be... Mason?! Crispin remembered seeing him from afar at a banquet a few years ago, no wonder he felt familiar just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he looked at Veronica, who was holding onto Mason. Wasn't the reason he wanted to see Veronica to find out what kind of person the woman who Mason called "sister" was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crispin really hoped that what Veronica said was true, that she and Mason had no contact and no relationship anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm not his girlfriend, I'm not..." Veronica said with difficulty, holding onto Mason even tighter, as if holding onto a lifeline. "Help... help me... please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was full of hope and pleading, and even her eyes were covered with a layer of mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at her face, his expression still indifferent. "But why should I help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's body trembled, her head slowly lowered from its raised position, and her hands holding onto him also loosened little by little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drunkenness still lingered on her body, but she seemed to have used up the last bit of her sobriety. "I... I'm sorry... I said the wrong thing... I... I shouldn't have asked you to help me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished her words intermittently and tried to leave.</span></p></div>
