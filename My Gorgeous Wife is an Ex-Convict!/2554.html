        <h1>Chapter 2552</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The statement set off a tempestuous wave in George Gregory's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wedding dress... Why would she go there in a wedding dress? What exactly does that mean?' Uneasiness and fear filled his heart as he stepped on the gas pedal and sped off toward the Moss family's cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Amber Mitchell... Amber Mitchell...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The name kept flashing across his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those pledges of eternal love seemed to echo in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Amby, I love you. I&rsquo;ll take good care of you and won't let you suffer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Amby, I can do whatever you want. I only want you to be safe and happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Amber Mitchell, I have never loved anyone so much in my life, and I have never wanted anyone to marry me this much. Let me be with you for the rest of your life. I&rsquo;ll be with you for the rest of mine, okay?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These words had come out of his own mouth. He meant it with all sincerity when he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he never fulfilled them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had suffered a grievous injustice. She was not safe, let alone happy, but... he did nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just let it happen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;George, don't betray my feelings, okay?&rsquo; Her voice seemed to ring in his ears. &lsquo;I will love you with all my heart. But I'll stop loving you if you betray me one day. I'll stop loving you once and for all.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him. Though her voice was soft, every word was so firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she was making him a lifetime promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What did he reply to her then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said... &lsquo;Okay, I won't betray you and our relationship.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what did he do in the end?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, George Gregory saw a car rushing by and slammed on the brakes. The two cars were only a few centimeters apart and were about to collide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don&rsquo;t you know how to drive? Are you in a hurry to die?" The driver of the other car rolled down the car window and stuck their head out of the window to scold George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory let out a breath, ignored them, and backed up. He bypassed the car and drove on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Amber Mitchell! I want to see Amber Mitchell as soon as possible.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car finally arrived outside the Moss family's cemetery, he almost stumbled out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many of the Moss family's security guards were standing outside the cemetery. They stopped George Gregory as soon as they saw George Gregory getting out of the car and running over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is the Moss family's cemetery. Outsiders are not allowed to enter," one of them said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get out of the way!" George Gregory snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they showed no intention of moving aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory did not want to bother with anything else. He only wanted to get into the cemetery and see Amber Mitchell.</p></div>
