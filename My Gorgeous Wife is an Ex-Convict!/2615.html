        <h1>Chapter 2613</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said nothing, but her expression seemed to be agreeing tacitly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bitterness on his face thickened. "Yeah, I don't understand you. I never... understood you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he understood her, how could he have recognized her so late and believed others when she needed help the most?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not understand her and missed out on her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, stop your obsession with me. If you're willing to get over it, you&rsquo;ll have a new beginning. I believe you&rsquo;ll meet a woman truly worthy of your love," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But that woman won't be you. Is that what you mean to say?" he said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yes, that woman won't be me and shouldn't be me. If you want what's best for me, you should get over me. I don't want Jay to misunderstand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Getting over someone was not that easy! However... looking at the person brimming with happiness in front of him, what he said was... "Okay, I'll get over you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it would make her happy, he would do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he was unwilling and was only acting, he would do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the faint smile on Brian's lips, Grace's heart ached. However, Brian then walked past her and got into a nearby car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car slowly drove out of her sight, and Grace gently looked down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not give Brian any response because the person she loved had never been him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After stopping by the store and giving Nelson the stationery and books, Grace returned to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in the bedroom, she was about to change into her loungewear when a pair of arms immediately wrapped around her from behind. Then, she felt hot kisses on the back of her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a familiar scent in her nose, and Grace froze before saying, "Jay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the only one who could do such a thing to her at the Reed family&rsquo;s house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes..." he answered softly, turned her body around, and kissed her on the lips. The possessive kiss almost left her breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a long time before he ended the kiss and pressed her hard into his arms. "If you weren&rsquo;t pregnant, I'm afraid..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not finish his words, but the meaning was clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face reddened. "Why did you suddenly..." As if recalling something, she suddenly said, "Do you know that I met Brian today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he had assigned bodyguards to protect her in secret. She knew that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, Brian and I... only had a chat. Besides..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe he'll get over me," Grace could not help saying when she recalled what Brian had said today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Brian had said it indifferently, she seemed to feel how determined he was when he said it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe?" Jason snorted gently. What followed were more passionate kisses. "Even if he can't get over you, he won't have any chance. Grace, you're mine and only mine!"</p></div>
