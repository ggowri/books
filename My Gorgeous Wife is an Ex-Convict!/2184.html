        <h1>Chapter 2182</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the two children unanimously asked to sleep in one room, Grace did not think much about it. After all, since William had left the Reed family, the two siblings often slept together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick said he wanted to comfort his sister too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Grace told the two children bedtime stories and tucked them in. When she saw the little ones slowly closing their eyes, she left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she did not expect was that the little ones opened their eyes and began to quietly change their clothes after she left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper began to check her small backpack while Mick Reed connected his phone to the LCD TV in their room. Various software began to bounce on the big screen, and Mick Reed's fingers quickly tapped on his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, the surveillance screens in the hotel's control room instantly went dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's going on? Did someone hack the hotel's security system?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hurry and fix it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Does some hacker want to use this as blackmail? Are they asking for money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do we do? We can't fix it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How can that be? Isn't this the best security system in tMason Swansonty?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Who? Who on earth did this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was a lot of chaos in the hotel's control and computer room. No one expected the culprit to be a six-year-old child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace only noticed that her two children had gone missing half an hour later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason stared at the large LCD screen hanging on the wall of the room where the children had slept earlier. There were codes jumping up and down. His face turned grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Only Mick could do such a thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed that he was careless, after all. The children did not want to spend the night here so that they could wait for William to come see them but they were planning to go to William!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, they had no idea when the two kids left!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason quickly took out his phone and dialed the number of the hotel's reception desk. He intended to check the surveillance footage to know the time the children left. However, his face turned paler a moment later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? What did the hotel say?" Grace asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The hotel said the surveillance system started malfunctioning half an hour ago,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Half an hour ago?" Grace was stunned. That meant that their son and daughter might have sneaked out at that time. "Could they have snuck out to find William? Should we contact Philip Barlow immediately? But... they don't know where the Barlow family&rsquo;s house is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's not difficult to find out where the Barlow family&rsquo;s house is. Mick can easily look it up." Jason said as he called Philip Barlow, and the call was soon answered.</p></div>
