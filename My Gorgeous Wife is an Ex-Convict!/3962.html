        <h1>Chapter 3960</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy slept restlessly in the middle of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Large beads of sweat dripped down his face as he muttered helplessly, "Don't... Mom... don't... don't come near me... Mom, don't die, please... don't... don't die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick leaned in to check on Nancy, but as soon as he reached out to touch her face, she grabbed his hand tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held on so tightly that it made his wrist ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what made him even more uneasy was the look of despair on her face, even in her sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, it's all over now. No one will hurt you again!" Mick comforted Nancy softly as she </span><span>slept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his words seemed to have no effect. She tossed and turned as if she were desperately trying to escape from something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she opened her eyes wide and grabbed Mick as if he were the last piece of driftwood in a drowning person's grasp, pressing his body tightly against hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her rapid breathing sounded in his ear, and although he could have pushed her away, he didn't. Instead, he hugged her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you have a nightmare?" Mick asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm so scared..." Nancy murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid. It's all over now. I promised you that no one will hurt you again," he reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm still scared... scared that I'll end up like my mother, dying under mysterious circumstances!" Nancy trembled as she spoke. "When Clarissa was beating me, my mother tried to stop her, but Clarissa pushed her off the balcony. And even though Clarissa was the killer, the Schultz family managed to make my mother's death look like an accident. Clarissa didn't have to take any responsibility at all! What if one day, I die too, and my death is also made to look like an accident? Just like my mother..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her body shook violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's eyes darkened. "Your mother was pushed off the balcony by Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, even though Clarissa was the killer, the Schultz family managed to make my mother's death look like an accident. Clarissa didn't have to take any responsibility at all!" Nancy hugged Mick even tighter, her voice filled with fear. "What if one day, I die too, and my death is also made to look like an accident? Just like my mother..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the last words faded away, they were drowned out by sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! That day will never come," Mick said, looking down at Nancy's tear-streaked face. He gently wiped away her tears with his hand and continued, "I won't let you get hurt for nothing. This time, Clarissa won't get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" she asked, her eyes misty with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never lie," Mick replied. "Now, don't be afraid anymore. Go back to sleep, I'll be here with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy hesitated for a moment and said, "Can you sleep with me? I mean, just lie down on the bed with me... I didn't mean anything else, please don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes suddenly became deep and mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing her words might have been misunderstood, she quickly added, "I mean, just sleeping together on the bed... Please don't take it the wrong way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she quickly let go of his hand, lay back on the bed, and covered her head with the blanket, seeming embarrassed to face him.</span></p></div>
