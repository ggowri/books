        <h1>Chapter 1392</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the family photo of three that Nelson longed for. He liked to look at these photos on her phone from time to time, and a contented smile would appear on his little face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because of this that Kyla Corbyn was temporarily keeping the photos on her phone and did not delete them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked down at the photo of the three of them on the merry-go-round. Nelson was smiling happily while she was clutching the armrest next to her with a nervous look and a slight frown on her face as though she was suppressing something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain had acted up at the time, making her feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the photo, Martin Weiss had his head turned as though he was looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the photo, people who had no idea would probably think Martin Weiss was looking at her with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, photos were only illusions sometimes. Even if she and Martin Weiss were sitting on the same wooden horse on the merry-go-round, there would be a moat separating them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only hoped that... even in hell, she and he would never meet again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Kyla Corbyn suddenly heard her son's young voice call out, "Daddy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn immediately looked up and only saw Nelson's tiny body running toward a tall figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's... Martin Weiss!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn froze for a moment and looked at Martin Weiss who was walking over in surprise. However, his face was terribly gloomy. Even though Nelson had already run up to him, he did not stop nor even look at Nelson. Instead, he walked straight to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's heart was suddenly filled with unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss walked up to Kyla Corbyn and said in a cold voice, "Follow me to the hospital and apologize to Paisley. Do you know that Paisley miscarried because you pushed her? Her three-month-old baby is gone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was surprised that her speculation had come true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Paisley Daniels miscarried. She set me up on purpose, but... why? Why did Paisley Daniels put on such a show?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Paisley Daniels had felt threatened by her back then, Martin Weiss only detested and hated her now. She no longer posed a threat to Paisley Daniels!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it necessary for Paisley Daniels to sacrifice her baby for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Kyla Corbyn could think further, Martin Weiss grabbed her hand and wanted to take her to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she stayed rooted in the same place with no intention of following him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not going to apologize, Martin Weiss. You asking me to apologize to Paisley Daniels is the greatest joke!" Kyla Corbyn said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Greatest joke?" Martin Weiss looked at Kyla Corbyn coldly. "Kyla Corbyn, it seems that I&rsquo;ve been too kind to you. Putting you in prison for only three and a half years was the greatest joke! Paisley wouldn't have been hurt if you were still in prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn just looked at him with a funny look. "Martin Weiss, you're blind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He roared, "That's enough! I don't care if you like it or not, you must apologize to Paisley today or I'll put you in prison for life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy was wronged. She didn't harm anyone!" the young voice suddenly interjected the adults' conversation. Nelson's face was red, and his little body stood in front of Kyla Corbyn as if to protect his beloved mother!</p></div>
