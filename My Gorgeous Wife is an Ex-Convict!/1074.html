        <h1>Chapter 1073</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said truthfully, "It's one of the Reed family's old mansions. However, very few people know about this place, and the Reed family has never announced it to the public."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help frowning. 'Is he implying that an outsider would have a hard time finding out that he's keeping me here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, you're not the only one who's locked up in this mansion," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked. 'What does that mean?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A woman was once locked up in here too. This mansion was bought to keep that woman here," Jason said as if he was telling her a story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She felt a chill enveloping her body. 'Another woman&hellip; was locked up in here too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was probably around 70 years ago. One of the Reed family's ancestors fell in love with a woman, but she already had a fianc&eacute; and the couple was very much in love. Therefore, this ancestor kidnapped the woman and locked her up in this mansion, guarding her day and night just to make her fall in love with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's voice had always been cold, and when it rang in the large vintage dining room, it gave off an air of cold depression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had found the place vintage and elegant when she was first brought here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she felt differently after hearing him say so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened&hellip; afterward?" She heard herself asking somewhat hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Afterward, that woman fell in love with the Reed family's ancestor and managed to leave this place," he said as he stared at her. "What about you? Do you want to get out of here too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly found her throat dry. "I can't leave if I don't fall in love with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be here with you until you fall in love with me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kept quiet. 'Just like the woman who was locked up in here? She still fell in love with the man who kept her here even though she already had a fianc&eacute; she loved deeply.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, we haven't finished our meal. Hurry up and eat. It's going to get cold." He urged her and added food to her bowl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the food in her bowl, she asked dryly, "Why do I have to fall in love with you again? If you want to be loved, find a woman who's willing to love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There should be a lot of such women in Emerald City. After all, he was Jason&mdash;Emerald City's Master Reed! Even without that status, his appearance alone would have captivated many women!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice rang out. "What about you? Why did you bring me back to your place in the first place? If you hadn't taken me to your place and made me call you Sis, I wouldn't have fallen in love with you. I wouldn't be keeping you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up suddenly, their eyes meeting once more. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled faintly and looked at her gently. "You were the one who brought me into your world for the first time, weren&rsquo;t you? Isn't it too late to ask me why it has to be you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart felt as if it had been hit hard. 'Yes, all this wouldn't have happened if I hadn't taken him back to my place back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;I was the one who brought him into my world. Now he won&rsquo;t let me when I want to withdraw!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you taught me what it's like to love someone. Since you made me fall deeply in love with you, don't you think you should be responsible for me?" he said as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'"It's not that I... never loved you, but we&rsquo;ve broken up," she said dryly. She could not fall in love with anyone anymore.</p></div>
