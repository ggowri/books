        <h1>Chapter 1918</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A series of explosions rocked Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The explosions caused the collapse of half an abandoned building as well as varying degrees of damage to surrounding buildings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The emergency evacuation of people from nearby buildings with the cooperation of several departments went straight to the top of the trending list online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As the incident developed, many rubbernecking netizens instantly focused more on the incident when they realized that Jason and his wife were also involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the Reed family and the police were suppressing all information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All they knew was that the culprit Katherine Jackson was already dead, and the mercenaries who helped Katherine Jackson commit the crime were all in detention awaiting prosecution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was lying on the operating table. All the hustle and bustle outside was far away from her. She found it surreal. It was as if she was in a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I... really alive?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Jay and I are alive and well. We didn't die! We survived!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She still shuddered at the thought of their final escape. Jay's men had gone straight down the rope ladder, tied the rope to Jay, and quickly pulled them into the helicopter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His hand held hers the entire time, never letting go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he had let go, she would have fallen straight down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she got to the helicopter, she saw many bloodstains on Jay&rsquo;s body, presumably caused by the collapse of all the rubble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, his upper body was bare at the time. His body was pressed against the rough, cracked floor that was full of rubble. When he used all his might to grip her hand, his flesh was directly brushing against the ground and rubble. One could imagine how painful it must have been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, all he did was reach out to press her neck that was still oozing blood. "Grace, I'm not going to let anything happen to you. We'll go to the hospital right now. You're going to be okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His face was stained with tears, while his eyes were scarlet. With all the bloodstains, it was clear to anyone else that he was the one severely hurt. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She opened her mouth to say something, but he said, "Don&rsquo;t talk. I'll tell you anything you want to know when we get to the hospital and the doctor has stopped the bleeding!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The helicopter soon arrived at the hospital. Even though Jason was covered in injuries, he held Grace tightly and ran to the operating room which they had already booked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace was pushed into the operating room, the last thing she saw was Jason's disheveled figure and his pale but dirty face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was Emerald City's high and mighty Young master Reed. When had he ever been so disheveled?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, as far as she could recall, all the times he was this disheveled were all because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Reed, we're going to anesthetize you now, then we&rsquo;re going to perform an emergency operation on your neck. Blink twice if you agree," the doctor said to Grace in the operating room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because Grace could not speak at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace blinked twice, then the anesthesiologist prepared the injection and slowly injected the solution into her body.</p></div>
