        <h1>Chapter 4203</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit stared blankly at the door of the operating room, filled with endless regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't lied, if he had told Tina everything when he found her and handed her over to the Stephenson family and the Hunter family, would Tina have not experienced this accident?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this happened because of his selfishness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, it was time for his lies to be exposed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a nurse hurriedly came out holding a baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby was placed into the waiting incubator!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is the child?" Kit asked anxiously and timidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The situation is not good. The child needs treatment now, but the medical expenses are expensive. And if the child's condition worsens later, it would be best to transfer to a larger hospital. The medical environment here is not good," the nurse said hurriedly and then left with the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surgery continued, and when the door of the operating room finally opened again, Kit heard the doctor say to him, "Although we saved the patient's life, the situation is not very </span><span>good. We can't predict when they will wake up. For now, we can only observe. But we recommend that you transfer to a bigger hospital in a big city as soon as possible. They have better medical equipment there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the doctor's words, Kit felt even more distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tina was pushed out by the nurse, Kit only saw that her face had lost all color. She lay on the mobile bed as if she were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a short while ago, she was smiling at him! She was talking to him about their future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wrong. He was really wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she could be safe and sound, he was willing to give everything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a news story became popular, reporting that a former idol star was involved in a car accident in a small town, and there was also a pregnant woman with him!</span></p></div>
