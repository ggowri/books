        <h1>Chapter 378</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason knew that Grace did not like the dark; even when she went to bed she would always sleep with the lights on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past when they were still staying in a rental house, she was able to sleep with the light off for a while. However, she reverted to the habit of sleeping with the lights on later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned slightly. Was she not in the room?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just as he was about to turn away, he heard muffled crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was there!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a sudden pause in his tracks and then his hand reached the wall to turn on the lights. Consequently, light poured into the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All Jason could see was a thin figure that was huddled in the corner of the room. She was crouching with her back facing the wall; her face was buried in her knees, and her shoulders were twitching. The low, repressed sobs came from her continuously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she crying?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His black eyes narrowed, and he quickly walked up to her. Crouching down and looking at her, he asked, "What's the matter? What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned by his voice. Moving her head slightly, she raised it and looked at him with her misty, almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were red and swollen, and she had been crying for some time. Her face was wet with tears, and her fragile and painful expression made Jason&rsquo;s heart throb with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seldom saw her cry, but whenever he saw her do so, he felt helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, what happened?" It took him a while to find his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sniffed as she choked, "I... I can't find where my mother is. I can't find... can't find..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tears in her eyes poured out like an overflowing dam as the words came out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she reached home, she thought long and hard about where her father would move her mother's grave. A cemetery? Some burial hill?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she wanted to look, she did not know how to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how many calls she made to her father and stepmother, or Evelyn, no one answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know what else she could do. 50 million dollars? Even if she sold herself, she would not be able to get 50 million dollars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were suddenly fixed on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, maybe her father and stepmother had asked her for 50 million dollars because they thought Jason had her back. She did not have 50 million dollars but Jason did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned. He could not understand what she was saying. Was her mother not already dead? What did she mean by she could not find her mother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What&rsquo;s the matter? Explain," Jason said as he raised his hand and wiped the tears off her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s hand suddenly seized his, a flash of determination in her eyes. "Give me 50 million dollars. If you'll give it to me, then... I'll stay with you. I'll stay no matter how long you want me to stay with you. I'll do whatever you want me to do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he gave her 50 million dollars, she could find out where her mother's grave was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mom... was like a spiritual sustenance to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had lost so much that she could not stand losing the place to pay respects to her mother! She did not want to lose it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes darkened as he stared at Grace. "Do you know what you're saying?"</p></div>
