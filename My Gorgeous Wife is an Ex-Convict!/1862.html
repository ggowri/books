        <h1>Chapter 1860</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two men looked at each other in the silent night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At that moment, Grace felt as if she had gone back to the time when she first saw him. His face was just as expressionless back then as it was now. His deep and beautiful peach blossom eyes were cold and empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, I'm sorry," she mumbled. Her apologetic voice sounded particularly clear at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason gently looked down. "Sorry? Why apologize?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know I shouldn't have gone down on my knees and begged you today. I know how much you hate your mother, yet I asked you to forgive her," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She never expected to run into such a complicated situation. Her mentor and his wife were kind to her, and she had to repay them for their kindness. However, the last thing she wanted was to hurt him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps people would always be partial. He would always be the one she cared about the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was also the last person she wanted to hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason kept his head down and did not make a sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Step by step, Grace continued to approach him until they were just one step away from each other. "Jay, forgive me, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyelashes quivered a little, and he slowly looked up. Those beautiful peach blossom eyes were deep and dark. "Do you want me to forgive you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then how much do you love me?" he asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I..." She took a deep breath and recalled how she had fallen into the sea five years ago. "I love you. You're more important to me than my own life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He suddenly sneered, and a hint of sarcasm appeared on the corners of his lips. "More important than your own life? But you can kneel in front of me to beg me for Mrs. Watts, someone you've only known for two to three years. You know how that woman has hurt me. Can you even believe yourself when you say such a thing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What will it take to convince you?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said coldly, "Stay out of my and that woman's business. Even if they ask you to plead for them, don't do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. She felt like she was being driven into a corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew there was no way he would give up his revenge on Mrs. Watts. After all, the damage he had suffered was too great and too deep to be remedied overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Mrs. Watts was very old, and her mentor had always been loyal to his wife. The two elderly could not afford his revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He seemed to have expected her silence. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you still believe in your love for me if you can't even do such a thing?" he said lightly as he got up and turned around, not wanting to look at her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The sight of her would only spoil his mood and make him find his feelings ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I knew all along that she doesn&rsquo;t love me nearly as much as I love her, didn't I?'</p></div>
