        <h1>Chapter 1505</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence felt his heart sink. 'That urn&hellip; Does it mean&hellip;' He dared not continue thinking about it. He could only turn his head away and look at Jason anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, it was as though Jason's body was frozen. He did not move an inch and just stared at the urn in Secretary Wang's hands. His eyes became red as though he was about to burn holes through that urn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Where's&hellip; Grace?" No one knew how much time had passed before Jason finally spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Isn't she just right in front of you?" Secretary Wang replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was like Jason did not hear that reply and asked once more, "Where's Grace?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang suddenly let out a chuckle. "Young master Reed, don't tell me you were expecting a pregnant woman who fell into the ocean from the cliff to have survived? You should consider yourself lucky for having one child survive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His reply sounded very logical, yet it made Jason want to pounce right on Secretary Wang. He had just endured a tremendous shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang placed the urn in his hands in front of him. "Young master Reed, if you don&rsquo;t mind having Grace's ashes scatter all over the floor, then feel free to punch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason withheld his punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, his body started trembling. He snatched the urn, hugging it in his arms tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How could it be ashes?!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That year, when he held his father's ashes, he had thought it was the most suffering he had ever gone through in his life. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, right now, his hands were holding&hellip; Grace's ashes. 'It turns out that there are more terrible things in life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace, my Grace! How could there only be her ashes left?! Her voice and smile are still vividly flashing in my mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I can still her hear talking to me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;I love you, Jay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jay I wish to give you a happy family. A happy family with you, me, and our kids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'In the end, she told me that I have to continue living.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Each comment of hers was vividly embedded in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace&hellip;" Jason suddenly staggered and vomited a mouthful of fresh blood. Then, he felt as though his body had lost the strength to support himself. He dropped to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he was falling to the ground, he grabbed onto the urn tightly. It was like he was holding onto the most precious thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence and the bodyguards quickly stepped forward to grab hold of Jason. Terrence realized Jason had passed out cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is Grace really dead?" Terrence glared at Secretary Wang and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang raised his brows. "If not, whose ashes are those?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence held onto his breath. "Then&hellip; the triplets in her tummy&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Didn't I just mention it? He should consider himself lucky that one of them managed to stay alive," said Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence was completely mad at Secretary Wang. "You must be satisfied now, right? When Young master Reed wakes up, he might even end up being crazy! Did Old master Reed want you to make his biological grandson go crazy and have the entire Reed family destroyed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, Old master Reed only hopes that Young master Reed, as the head of the Reed family, will not have any weaknesses. If you don't wish for Young master Reed to wake up a crazy person, then just follow my orders," said Secretary Wang with a carefree look. </p></div>
