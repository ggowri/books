        <h1>Chapter 3085</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's expression let Camille know that her friend wasn't joking or acting impulsively, but was serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you discussed it with Brian?" asked Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's eyelashes fluttered and her eyes drooped slightly. "He said that as long as I tell him directly, it will be enough. I left a note for him in his room and also told the servants in this house to let him know when he returns."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Camille looked very troubled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille, I really want to go back to my own apartment early. If you don't want to help me move, then I can do it slowly by myself," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't say I didn't want to!" Camille quickly said, looking at her friend with a determined expression, but also with a hint of embarrassment and self-doubt in her eyes. Camille felt sorry for her friend. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is Valda feeling insecure about her legs? Valda and Brian already had some insecurities when they were together, and now it seems like those insecurities have only gotten worse. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, this kind of inferiority complex cannot be solved overnight. It can only be gradually overcome in the future through guidance and support.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While helping Valda move her things, Camille secretly called Brian when her friend wasn't paying attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, the phone line was still not connected, which made Camille feel like she wanted to vomit in frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yesterday she couldn't get through to Valda on the phone, but today she can't get through to Brian's phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After almost everything was loaded onto Camille's car, she still couldn't reach Brian on the phone. She left him a message and then drove away from his villa with her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, on the other side, Brian is pulling Patrick to drink together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick looked at his friend who had already consumed two bottles of red wine with a skeptical expression. Apart from the two months when Brian couldn't find Valda, he used to drink frequently and almost got alcohol poisoning. However, he rarely drinks now, and even when he does, it's only a small amount.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at this moment, Brian is drinking alcohol as if he's just pouring water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened? Did you drink so much alcohol?" Patrick couldn't help but ask. "Why don't you tell me about it? Maybe I can give you some advice?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda is back," Brian said, leaving Patrick stunned. "What did you say? Valda is back? Have you seen Valda?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I saw him," Brian said with a bitter smile, then took another sip of his drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But this doesn't make sense. She's back, so why are you still dragging me here to drink alone?" Patrick said, puzzled. Normally, at a time like this, Brian and Valda should be clinging to each other, not wanting to be apart for even a second, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She didn't want to see me at all. She came back several days ago, but she would rather limp around in a small hotel room alone than appear in front of me. If it weren't for Camille blurting it out yesterday, she might have avoided me even longer!" Brian said dejectedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His longing and searching, in the end, seemed like a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was even more surprised, "What, you're saying... Valda has a lame leg?"</p></div>
