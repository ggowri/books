        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They said they'll come over later," Lina replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hunter family and the Quentin family are both Crypt families, so Lornell has become closer to Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, after some time, two figures walked into the living room of the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler, who is 20 years old, is already 185 centimeters tall with long legs. He looks like a hanger, with a sculpted face that exudes the aura of a young man. He gives off a cold and hard feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his eyes carry a hint of softness, which softens his cold and hard demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, 12-year-old Lornell is still between childhood and adolescence. Although he is already over 170 centimeters tall, his face still has obvious childishness, with a delicate androgynous beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When these two people walked in, they gave people a sense of beautiful advertising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tina saw Chandler, she immediately bounced over to him and asked, "Hey, you guys are here. Did you bring a gift for Jasmine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler smiled slightly and took out the gift, "Here, this is for Jasmine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?" Tina asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll find out when the gift's owner opens it, won't you?" Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, 8-year-old Harley also came over to Lornell and asked curiously, "Lornell, what gift did you bring?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My old man gave me a bottle of Qi-boosting pills to give as a gift," Lornell said lazily, taking out a white medicine bottle with no packaging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for Crypt families like the Quentin family, who are experts in medicine, many medicines are priceless. The Qi-boosting pills given by the Quentin family are naturally not ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace took the medicine bottle from Lornell and said, "Thank you, Lornell. Please also convey my gratitude to your old man when you go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to being born prematurely, Jasmine has been weak and sickly since childhood. Although the Reed family has been taking care of her health, she is still more prone to illness than the average person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Jasmine, the Quentin family's Qi-replenishing pills were the best thing ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper kept glancing towards the entrance of the living room, as if waiting for something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William approached her and asked, "Are you waiting for Lawrence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm-hmm," Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he doesn't plan on coming. After all, he had a difficult time here before," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, he will definitely come," Jasper said confidently. "Since he took the invitation, </span><span>he will come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked at Jasper's determined expression and suddenly asked, "What about you? Do you want him to come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was taken aback and looked up at William. "Why do you ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just curious," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Jasper said, "I want him to come. Whether he has good intentions or bad intentions, only if he is willing to take that step can we possibly resolve the grievances between us, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true," William agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were speaking, another figure walked into the living room. Jasper froze and looked straight at the person. It was...Roger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really came.</span></p></div>
