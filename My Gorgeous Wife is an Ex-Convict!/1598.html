        <h1>Chapter 1596</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We're not... having a baby. I was just playing with Daddy," Grace could only reply awkwardly and quickly changed the subject by saying, "By the way, you&rsquo;ve never been to the amusement park with Daddy, Mick?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I've been to the amusement park, but not with Daddy," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace turned to look at Jason. "You didn't go with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I sent the maid to accompany him," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Weren&rsquo;t you afraid of the maid losing focus? Then Mick would&rsquo;ve gotten lost in the amusement park!" Besides, children would only be happy if they went to the amusement park with their parents!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He won't get lost," Jason said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What makes you so sure?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was then that Grace found out that Jason would reserve the entire amusement park when their son went there. The amusement park staff just had to serve Mick and the maid who was in charge of taking him around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason had even sent ten bodyguards to follow their son in case something happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Well, nothing was going to happen if that was the case. However, Grace was also a little speechless that he made a child's trip to the amusement park such a big deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In her opinion, going to an amusement park like that was just like playing a single-player game. How much fun could it be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mick, do you like going to amusement parks?" Grace asked her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, Mick Reed shook his head and said, "It's boring." Some things were fun the first time but boring the second time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Amusement parks are fun!" shouted Jasper Reed, disagreeing with what her brother said. "Mommy and I go to the amusement park at our place several times a year. The pirate ship's really fun, but there's a long queue, so Mommy only lets me ride on it twice every time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Speaking of which, the little one had a lot of regrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it fun?' Mick Reed's little face had doubts. Emerald City's amusement park also had a pirate ship. The maid had accompanied him on it, but he did not find it interesting at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you like it, Daddy can reserve the entire amusement park again. You can ride it as many times as you want," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Can I?" Jasper Reed's almond-shaped eyes instantly shimmered as she looked at Jason with great expectation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was about to say yes but Grace quickly said, "Why don't we go to the amusement park together as a family? There's no need to reserve the entire amusement park. Think about it. If we reserve the entire amusement park, there won't be anything for the other kids to play on that day, right? If you have the amusement park to yourselves, then what about the other children? Should they play elsewhere?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper shook her head immediately, and Mick Reed also shook his head when he saw his sister shaking her head. He did not think it was wrong, but since his sister wanted the other children to play too, he was willing to let the other children play as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, that's decided then. We'll go to the amusement park this weekend," Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper immediately cheered with joy. Though Mick Reed was not interested in going to the amusement park, seeing how happy his sister was, a faint smile appeared on his little face too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes glimmered as he looked at the scene in front of him. She once said she would give him a home and had indeed given it to him, along with herself and the kids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was muddle-headed in these five years when he suffered from amnesia, not realizing how precious Mick was to him! He also did not realize how precious she was to him.</p></div>
