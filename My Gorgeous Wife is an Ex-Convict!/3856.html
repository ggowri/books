        <h1>Chapter 3854</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, his fingers slipped into her mouth, and his lips lingered on her chin, neck, and collarbone...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica didn't know how long she and Mason had been "entangled," but when she got out of the car with a red face, she realized that the car had already been parked at the entrance of the restaurant's parking lot, and the driver had even gotten out and was waiting nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did the driver hear us? He probably even knows what happened in the car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Veronica's face turned even redder, like a cooked shrimp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason, who was one of the parties involved, appeared calm and collected without any hint of blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was surprised because she knew that the man who would blush when she touched his ear was not blushing at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even during the meal, Veronica's face remained flushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why is your face still so red? Are you still shy?" Mason's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stiffened. Of course, she was still feeling shy! But what came out of her mouth was, "N-no, not at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If that's the case, then why haven't you been looking at me?" he asked. "Do you know that during this meal, you've hardly lifted your head to look at me? I can count the number of times you've looked at me on one hand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip and suddenly looked up at him. "I-I'm looking at you now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled slightly. "Are you really that embarrassed? Didn't you take the initiative to press yourself against me when we were at your house before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"T-that's not the same thing," she stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, what's different?" he asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One was her taking the initiative, and the other was her being passive! Veronica thought to herself, but she couldn't bring herself to say such embarrassing words to him. Her face felt like it was on fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, no matter what, even if you blush and feel embarrassed, you have to get used to it," Mason said, raising his hand and gently stroking her crimson cheek. "Because in the future, we'll be doing even more intimate things!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face erupted like a volcano, and blood rushed to her face at lightning speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the meal, Veronica didn't even know what she had eaten. She just felt her face burning and her eyes not knowing where to look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until they reached the entrance of the detention center that Veronica finally calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of seeing Daniel soon made her body tremble slightly. Was she afraid? Was it because Daniel had tied her up in the old campus that was about to explode, with his twisted and sinister face and the things he said, that left her with psychological trauma?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a hand grabbed hers, and the warmth from the other person's hand spread to hers, causing her trembling to stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you afraid?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A little bit," Veronica chuckled bitterly. She had come to see Daniel on her own accord, but now she was scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With me here, there's nothing to be afraid of," Mason reassured her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A simple sentence that calmed her anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Veronica replied, "let's go, I'm fine now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them entered the detention center and arrived at the room where Daniel was being held alone.</p></div>
