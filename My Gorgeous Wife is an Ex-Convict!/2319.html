        <h1>Chapter 2317</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom sighed. 'She's so stubborn!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you mind waiting for a moment while I speak with Chairman Weiss? I&rsquo;ll check if Chairman Weiss would like to meet with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," Kyla said gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom went to Martin Weiss's office, while the other secretaries looked curiously at Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These secretaries knew who Kyla was. They knew their boss and the woman in front of them were husband and wife. However, they were so low-key that outsiders did not know about their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, the woman was pregnant, and Chairman Weiss had spent a long time in Emerald City for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Logically speaking, Chairman Weiss should attach great importance to this woman. He even arranged for Mallory to assist her. However, it seemed that she was having a hard time meeting Chairman Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone started having all kinds of speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the office, Mallory Malcom told Martin Weiss that Kyla was waiting outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If she wants to wait, let her wait," Martin Weiss said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I see," answered Mallory Malcom as he left the office and walked up to Kyla. "I'm sorry. Chairman Weiss doesn't want to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter. I'll wait here, then," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After asking Mallory Malcom for a glass of warm water, Kyla found a chair and sat down quietly without disturbing anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss was prepared to leave his office for lunch at noon, Kyla approached him and asked, "Can we talk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss peered at her coldly, "I thought I made myself pretty clear earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't say yes to your request. Jacqueline Bowman should be punished for what she did," said Martin Weiss as his eyes fell on her face that was growing paler. His heart seemed to beat a little faster, making him feel uncomfortable. "Kyla, you should know I never spare those who have hurt me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She trembled as she watched him walk past her to leave. She suddenly said, "What about me? I've hurt you too. Why did you spare me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stopped but did not turn back. He did not answer either as he walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes darkened. Mallory Malcom approached her, asking what Kyla would like for lunch. Then, he went to the company&rsquo;s cafeteria to buy her a set meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the next few days, Kyla would wait outside Martin Weiss's office every day like <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>she was going to work. She would have her lunch here and only leave when Martin Weiss left for work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It unknowingly became a peculiar routine. However, no one dared to say anything. Even when they talked about it, they only whispered among themselves. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After work today, Kyla watched Martin Weiss ignore her as he walked past in front of her. She lowered her head and packed up her things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was about to put her vacuum flask in the bag when she suddenly stiffened. Then, a low cry escaped her mouth as the vacuum flask fell from her hand to the floor, rolling away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla frowned. She did not pick up the vacuum flask but put a hand on her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's come over you?" A voice suddenly rang in her ears. She realized that Martin Weiss had picked up the vacuum flask she dropped and walked to her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"N-Nothing," she said as she took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it your stomach? I'll ask Mallory to take you to the hospital," said Martin Weiss.</p></div>
