        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A worried expression appeared on Tina's face, "What about the placenta? What about your illness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler felt strangely comforted in that instant, "You're worried about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned, staring blankly at the person in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, she was actually worried about him just now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because he said he was her husband, the father of her child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But didn't she remember him at all? The current him was like a stranger to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you worried about me?" his voice repeated again in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That voice carried a strong longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a strange feeling suddenly surged in her heart, and for a moment, she couldn't say any denying answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am worried. After all, the placenta could have cured your illness." She spoke softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly smiled, a smile that rarely appeared on his expressionless face, and tears filled his deep eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a side of him she had never seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt unable to take her eyes off his face. He was smiling, but it seemed like he was about to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even felt like his tears were about to overflow in the next moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't help but raise her hand and stroke Chandler's eye corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her with a puzzled gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly realized what she had done, "I just thought you were about to cry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wasn't crying," Chandler said softly, but his eyes were filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just very happy," he said in a low voice, "because you're worried about me, so I'm happy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Happy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was momentarily stunned. What was there to be happy about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now that the placenta is gone, what about your illness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay if the placenta is gone, then it's gone." As long as she is safe, it's enough for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tina fell asleep at night, her mind was still thinking about Chandler, and even his teary eyes kept appearing in her dreams. When she woke up, she even felt a bit dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did she care so much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even seeing the tears in his eyes made her heart ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another day passed, and Tina finally saw Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They met in a hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit was lying in bed, while Tina was sitting in a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina knew that Kit's injuries were actually worse than her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard the nurse say, in a semi-conscious state, that during the accident, Kit had used his body to shield her from part of the impact, protecting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she and the baby might not have survived!</span></p></div>
