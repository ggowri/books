        <h1>Chapter 1310</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't let the Atkinson family be destroyed. If there's such a day, I'll see Jason myself. As for... What you can do now is to stop Jason from opening fire on the Atkinson family!" said Harold Atkinson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily's expression immediately turned extremely pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, the once-popular celebrity, the Atkinson family's second heiress Lily, carelessly fell down the steps and fractured her arms. She needed to be treated in the hospital for some time. Even if she healed, she would probably suffer after-effects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The news was trending on online sites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, the Atkinson family and the Stevens family, who had an engagement with them, declined all interviews.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace saw the trending news, she asked Jason who was reading 100 Questions of Pregnancy. "Does Lily fracturing her arms have anything to do with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled faintly. "What's the matter? Are you afraid that I've done something illegal to stand up for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips together in silence as if agreeing tacitly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason closed the book in his hand, walked up to Grace, and squatted down before saying, "Maybe I would if it were before. I wouldn't care about it as long as I could achieve my goal! But now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes stared intently at her. "I won't do anything illegal because of you. I'll obey the law, and if I have to deal with anyone, I'll only deal with them within what the law allows." It was because he knew that she respected the law and had a sense of justice. He loved her and would naturally change some of his behaviors for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was slightly stunned. At this moment, she felt very clearly that he was integrating into her world little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," she said. She and he were no longer just two horizons forcibly intertwined by children but were getting closer and closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to thank for? I love you. Isn't all this as it should be?" he said, gently cupping her hands with his fingers. "I want Lily to compensate you with her hands, so the Atkinson family is using Lily's arms to express goodwill."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, he added, "What about you? Do you want to forgive Lily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "I'll never forgive someone who hurt me like that. Besides, even if she smashed and broke both her arms, it would just be like reading a piece of gossip news to me. And even if she did lose her arms, mine could never go back to the way they were, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. No matter how badly damaged her arms are, your hands could never be the same again. Then don't forgive her," Jason whispered and lowered his head to scatter tiny kisses over Grace's deformed joints.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "By the way, There's a course for pregnant women at the hospital that I'm interested in. The course teaches you what to do during pregnancy, what to prepare for labor, and also some knowledge about feeding the baby once they're born."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she could learn some of the information from books, she could learn more straightforwardly through attending courses. She could also ask the doctor on the spot if she had any questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I saw from the curriculum that it's best for pregnant women to join the course with their partners. Do... Do you have time to go with me?" Grace asked after hesitating a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she knew how busy he was with such a large company to run. Just like when she woke up in the middle of the night sometimes to find him in his study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&#12288;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just tell me the time and I'll arrange my schedule," Jason said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Won't you be pressed for time?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's not much I can do to help you with your pregnancy. I can't even share your pain when you give birth. It's just sparing some time to attend the course with you, and I'll make time however tight the schedule might be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, and his eyes fell on Grace's belly that had begun to show slightly. He raised his arms, gently wrapped them around her, and pressed his face on her belly as if this would bring him closer to the babies.</p></div>
