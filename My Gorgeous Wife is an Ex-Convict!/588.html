        <h1>Chapter 587</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Has Brian changed his mind?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn looked around at all the people who ridiculed and taunted her earlier. She felt relieved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hmph! Once she became Brian's girlfriend again, she would drive all of them out of the entertainment industry one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn left the set arrogantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she saw Brian, she realized that things... Might not be what she thought they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The place where she was meeting Brian was in the detention center, and her parents were in the meeting room of the detention center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was sitting in a chair, lazily sipping on his tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, her parents were trembling with fear. They were huddled in a corner on one side of the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn bit her lip, feeling butterflies in her stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was going on here? Why did Brian come here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew about her parents' detention, but because it was only for a few days, she did not care much as long as it did not get reported in the media.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you choose to meet here, Brian?" Evelyn softened her voice to make herself seem pitiful. "However, it's great that you&rsquo;ll see me. Can you help me? I don't want my parents to be detained here because of a little misunderstanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She duly assumed the appearance of a dutiful daughter and blamed her parents' detention on a misunderstanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Misunderstanding?" Brian asked coldly, his dark phoenix eyes full of indifference. "Your parents went to look for trouble with Grace. Did you give them the address?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's expression changed while Tony Cummins and Melinda Riley, who were huddled at the side, cowered again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not smart enough. I chose this place because I want your parents to hear this too. All the work you have at hand ends here. After your parents come out of detention, don't let me see you and your family in Emerald City again. If I do, it's not going to end so easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was stunned. Was he... Telling them to leave Emerald City?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The TV drama she got at hand&hellip; She had swallowed her anger these days just to make a successful comeback out of it. Was&hellip; Was he making her completely incapacitated?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't do this to me, Brian. If you stop all my work now, how can I continue to work in this industry? Besides, all&hellip; All my connections and my agency are in Emerald City. My parents have been here all their lives. How... How can I leave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said lightly, "You won't be hired by the entertainment industry nationwide from now on, so you don't have to worry about your connections and agency issues. If you don't want to leave, be prepared to accept the consequences of this decision."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was shocked. Was... He trying to blacklist her completely?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins and Melinda Riley wanted to say something, but they were too scared. Before Evelyn came, Brian had done enough to scare them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian... It's not fair. You're going to blacklist me and drive me and my family out of Emerald City just because my parents scolded Grace a little?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she tried to get closer to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Evelyn was only a few feet away from him, she was pinned down by Brian's bodyguards.</p></div>
