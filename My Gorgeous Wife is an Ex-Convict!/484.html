        <h1>Chapter 483</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, what came along with the traditional medicine were candy and chocolate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took her bitter traditional medicine, but it did not feel bitter at all. The traditional medicine was a kind of hope for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe if she was lucky, she might be able to have children of her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason unwrapped a piece of chocolate and held it to Grace's mouth. Grace naturally opened her mouth to eat the chocolate that was in between his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she accidentally &lsquo;ate&rsquo; his fingers too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All at once, Grace tried to step back and get his fingers out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his other hand instantly grabbed the back of her head while he stuck his fingers deeper into her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blushed, and now she could neither open her mouth nor shut it. There was chocolate in her mouth, which was melting with the temperature of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is the chocolate sweet?" he muttered. His gorgeous voice was like a night wind blowing through the bamboo. There was a sense of irresistible fascination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not taste the chocolate at all. Almost all her attention was focused on his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the back of her head was caught in his other hand and she could not move her head at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers were like some kind of silent enchantment, and she blushed even harder while feeling terribly hot all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when she could hardly stand, his fingers finally left her mouth. Her jaw seemed to stiffen, and she could not close her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her with glistening eyes. Then, he moved his fingers that were stained with chocolate and saliva to his lips before licking gently with the tip of his tongue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blushed profusely, almost subconsciously trying to look away, but it was as if some invisible force was forcing her to look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not take her eyes off his face. His eyes, his expression, his movements&mdash;they all seemed to have an indescribable attraction, attracting her to keep falling all the way down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he slowly bent down in front of her. With his beautiful face close to hers, he muttered, "Can you love me, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Never had he longed so much for the love of a human being. He wanted to be loved by her as if only then he would be satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Love him? Grace was stunned, and her mind was still dazed by her attraction for him. She was still in some kind of trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no doubt that she liked him, but love? If there was love, how deeply could she love him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to open her mouth to speak, he kissed her on the lips again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kissed her with such force that it seemed as if he wanted to despoil her of everything, but she was not allowed to retreat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sweet taste of chocolate filled her mouth. It was only now that she really felt the sweetness. It was really sweet&hellip; Really sweet...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was over, Grace nearly fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason put his hand under her arm, picked her up, and walked toward the huge bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace panted and blushed, and before she knew it, she was pinned to the bed by Jason in a whirl.</p></div>
