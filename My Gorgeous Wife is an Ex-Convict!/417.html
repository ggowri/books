        <h1>Chapter 416</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's fingers tightened slightly as he held the coffee cup. "What if I do regret it?" He had played down Grace's influence on him back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought Grace only looked like the one he was looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he gradually realized that there was more to it than that. When he saw someone trying to hurt her and hit her, he would feel his heart clench. Almost unconsciously, he would rush to her rescue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the slightest injury to her was enough to make his heart ache. Whenever she was about to leave, he was reluctant to part with her as if hoping that her eyes could stay on him for a while longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even just for a little while!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When had he ever cared so much for a woman? Besides the little girl who had saved his life, there was only her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even wondered if he should not have given her up so easily to Jason. If she had stayed with him, would it have made him miss the girl a little less and reduce the agony of his unrequited desire?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes sank as he stared at Brian somewhat coldly. "You'll never get the chance to do so. I won&rsquo;t let you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Brian met his eyes. "I would like to try and see for myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men looked at each other. Even Kyla Corbyn, who was at the cashier desk, could feel the tension in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From where she was standing, it was hard to hear what the two were talking about, but judging from their faces, it was not a pleasant conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Jason chuckled and smiled. It was too pretty to look at, but there was sarcasm in his bright and amorous eyes. "I thought you were only interested in the owner of the silver bracelet. Are you going to tell me that you have a thing for Grace? Since when did Master Hart become so promiscuous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes turned cold as he stared at Jason, his face taking on a ghastly expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason only smiled casually. "Tell me, if you manage to find the owner of the silver bracelet, what are you going to do with Grace? She has been a substitute for you all along. To me, she's different."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... is she to you?" Brian asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She means the world to me," Jason said it with great affirmation, but there was some vague anger in his eyes. "Brian, if you want to compete for Grace, you'll be going against me. Are you going to go against me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A flash of shock crossed Brian's face. He knew Jason cared about Grace, but it never occurred to him that he would care so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had put Grace in the same position as his world. If it was him, would Grace be in the same position?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;No,&rsquo; Brian answered in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He might be fond of, interested in, and concerned about Grace, but the only person who could be in the same position as his world was... the owner of the silver bracelet. There would not be another woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had lost to Jason on this point alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he going to go against Jason for Grace? Once they were enemies, then it would not only be between them but the Reed family and Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian knew this, and so did Jason.</p></div>
