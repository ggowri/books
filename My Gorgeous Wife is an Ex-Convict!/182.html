        <h1>Chapter 181</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She completed her sentence in broken pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he replied. After all, he had promised her. Since he had seen how she looked like when drunk, then he should fulfill her wishes to let those people go.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took the glass from her hand and drank from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must be very drunk. Otherwise, she would not have called him &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just never realized how much he enjoyed hearing her call him &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;. The way she gently called him &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; made him feel that someone was watching and waiting for him within the darkness that shrouded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled again in an extremely sweet manner. Then, she slumped against him as if she had completed her mission. Her arms curled around his neck. &ldquo;Jason, I&rsquo;m... I&rsquo;m so sleepy. I feel like... sleeping...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She mumbled before she fell asleep in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked down at the sleeping beauty in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was sober, she would always be so alert against him. Now that she was asleep, her guards against him could be put down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Sis, you look much cuter when you&rsquo;re drunk,&rdquo; he mumbled as he lifted his hand to sweep away the stray hairs on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her cheeks were a shade of camel red from all the wine she drank. Her almond eyes were shut, but it emphasized her curved lashes, tiny nose, and supple lips. She looked so attractive right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart wanted to prove that as it thumped faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his eyelids slightly before he reached for his jacket that was placed aside. He draped it over her body. He then carried her and left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was buried in his embrace as she continued to sleep soundly. When he reached the car park, Terrence was already waiting by the car and respectfully opened the car door for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason carried Grace into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not far from there, two people were also walking toward the car park. When they witnessed the scene, Brian raised his brows in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Looks like Jason has a woman now. Looking at the way he&rsquo;s carrying her so carefully into the car, that woman must have an important place in Jason&rsquo;s heart.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn who witnessed the same thing had a different thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She might not have seen the face of the woman in Jason&rsquo;s arms, but she saw the pair of shoes that the woman wore. She remembered that Grace had the same pair of shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that Jason is carrying Grace?!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered seeing Grace and Jason together at Grace&rsquo;s rented house previously. Sudden unrest rose in Evelyn&rsquo;s heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s car left the car park, and Evelyn also followed Brian into his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Brian, earlier... Was that Jason, president of Reed Group?&rdquo; Evelyn asked purposefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yup, it&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; Brian replied dryly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then... Do you know who he was carrying?&rdquo; She continued to pry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned his head slightly, and his gaze landed on her face. &ldquo;Why? Are you curious? If you want to know, then why don&rsquo;t you ask him the next time you see him?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;...&rdquo; She did not have the guts to do that! &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just being curious and simply asking.&rdquo; Evelyn sheepishly smiled.</p></div>
