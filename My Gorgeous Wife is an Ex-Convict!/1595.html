        <h1>Chapter 1593</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was also delighted to use these socialites to build popularity for her livestream channel. Even after setting up her company, she would ask these socialites to make an appearance in the livestream channels of the influencers working for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, ever since Grace returned to the Reed family, the socialites who used to curry favor with her had all suddenly disappeared. She called them to invite them to make an appearance on her livestream channels but they refused, saying they had something to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even the person surnamed Wan had turned her down. These people simply assumed that she did not have a chance to join the Reed family anymore, so they were now distancing themselves from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at Irene Lynch's grim face, her assistant asked cautiously, "Miss Lynch, tonight's livestream..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Go and find a celebrity. Someone a little famous, not some C-lister," snapped Irene Lynch. She wanted to show others that she could attract more traffic and do even better without these socialites!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wanted to make those who despised her regret it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I'll find one right now," the assistant said quickly and hurried out of the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch returned to her chair, picked up her phone again, and opened the photo album. She tapped on one of the photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the photo, Grace was standing elegantly and lavishly beside Jason in her limited edition gown and ruby necklace. She had seen this photo when someone posted it on their Moments yesterday!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I had my eye on that gown and ruby necklace first!' Irene Lynch's heart was filled with even more hatred when she thought about the ruby necklace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had her eye on the ruby necklace back then, but she could not afford it because it was too expensive. Therefore, she had sent some signals to Jason to see if he would buy it for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He bought it, but who knew he never had the intention of giving it to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even when she had hinted that she lacked a necklace to match her gown and wanted to borrow it, he still refused her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had just stared at her coldly while his delicate black eyes appeared calm. "This necklace isn't for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, the necklace was on Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Did he buy the necklace for Grace, then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had left for five years, but why did Jason not despise her? He even brought her to the banquet in such a grand manner. It was like telling everyone that Grace was still the rightful mistress of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It also made her situation more difficult! Irene Lynch's heart was filled with even more hatred as she thought of it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not believe that Grace led an innocent life in the past five years. Otherwise, why did she not come back for five years? She must find something she could use against Grace, so that she could turn the tables around!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Taking a deep breath, Irene Lynch dialed a phone number. "Look someone up for me. I want to know if she's done anything inappropriate in the last five years!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was almost fall. However, Terrence felt like it was still summer. His back and palms were covered with cold sweat. He figured that his face was sweating too.</p></div>
