        <h1>Chapter 4063</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was surprised. Kit? Her luck was really good!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you guys like Kit too?" the photographer asked with interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, we're all fans of Kit!" Eugenia replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, if the shoot ends later than theirs, I'll introduce you to them and let you see the studio. But you can't disturb the shoot!" the photographer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia was excited, and Tina was surprised. "Zabulon Albin, do you know someone in the next studio?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I worked with Kit before. My senior sister is shooting him today. I'll take two of Kit's fans to see him later. No problem," the photographer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The photographer had worked with Tina a few times before, and they had a good working relationship, so he was willing to help her out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you so much!" Tina said happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the encouragement of her idol, Tina's shoot went exceptionally smoothly and she was in great spirits! This earned her some praise from the photographer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the shoot was over, the photographer said, "Let's go to the next studio. I had my assistant check it out earlier and they're still shooting there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's great, Zabulon. Thank you so much!" Eugenia expressed her gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No problem!" Zabulon replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zabulon then led Tina and Eugenia to the next studio where they immediately spotted Kit standing under the lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, Kit was dressed in a white vintage-style shirt with matching pants, belt, and cuffs. There were also many jewels decorating the collar, making him look exceptionally magnificent, like a prince from the Middle Ages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia was immediately excited and covered her mouth. Coming here today was really worth it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was also watching Kit's shoot with great enthusiasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Tina was already familiar with the various processes of shooting and had been through several shoots herself, this was the first time she had watched someone else's shoot and found it quite interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially since the subject of the shoot was her favorite idol, this opportunity to see him up close was not something everyone could have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Tina's eyebrows furrowed and not long after, she heard the female photographer who was shooting say, "Kit, you're still not in the right state. If you continue like this, the photos may not turn out well. I've told you before that the main theme of this poster is mystery, light, and darkness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry!" Kit said with a tired expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take a break and let the makeup artist touch up your makeup," the female photographer said as she walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The makeup artist came over to touch up Kit's makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Zabulon walked over to the female photographer and greeted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia looked puzzled and asked, "I thought Kit did a great job earlier, why isn't the photographer satisfied?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Your attention was all on that face, anyway, no matter how Kit poses, you'll think it's great," Tina said. Although she is also a fan of Kit, she is not as extreme as Eugenia!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Before the photographer called a stop to the shoot, she had already noticed that Kit's performance was a bit off, as if he was exerting too much force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I was going to go up and say hello to him, but now it's awkward," Eugenia said regretfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, no idol wants to be seen by their own fans being criticized.</p></div>
