        <h1>Chapter 2856</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I knew it&rsquo;d cost money, but I didn't realize it would cost this much. The money probably adds up to several million dollars. Besides, you didn't give me any money except for the tuition fees after I got into university. I even earned my allowance by working part-time," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're bringing up old scores, aren't you? Alright, if I had known, I wouldn't have adopted you. It would&rsquo;ve been best if you had stayed at a welfare home," Ferris snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago quickly comforted Zhong Qisha, while Wynne said to Valda Theller, "Valda Theller, you're too stingy. Since you don't want to pay to save my father, who's your own uncle, what else is there to talk about? Let's pretend you're not a member of our family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you bring me back today because of Uncle's illness or money?" Valda Theller asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's for his illness, of course, but the treatment costs money!" Rowena Santiago said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If it's for medical reasons, give me Uncle's medical records and examination report. I'll make a copy&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was interrupted before she could finish speaking. "What examination report? You can either pay up or leave!" Ferris snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at her uncle's angry appearance and knew what was up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His illness might not be real, but the family definitely wanted to ask her for money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said no more and turned to leave. She had given up on her uncle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Valda Theller left, Rowena Santiago's face darkened. She said, "I told you the girl wouldn&rsquo;t give us money easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since she refused, don't blame us for using public opinion to force her." Ferris sighed. "Anyway, I've given her a chance. I don't owe my brother anything now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people kept themselves on the moral high ground even when plotting a scheme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a taxi, but she gave the address of Brian's mansion instead of her home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was surprised when she blurted out the address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if her body's instinct was telling her that she wanted to see him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she reached the mansion&rsquo;s entrance, she saw that the mansion was dark. It was clear that no one was at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he not home yet?' Disappointed, she leaned against the mansion's iron gate and pulled her phone out of her bag to contact him. However, she found that her battery was dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The night breeze blew against her body. She felt a little cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller squatted at the entrance to Brian's mansion and waited...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not even know how long she had been waiting, but she finally saw a familiar car approaching. A tall figure quickly stepped out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here? Why didn't you call me?" Brian asked as he grabbed Valda Theller's hands and frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands were icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just suddenly wanted to meet you, so I came to see you. But I realized my phone died when I got here," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long have you been waiting here?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know." She shook her head. "Maybe just for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips slightly. "Let's go in first."</p></div>
