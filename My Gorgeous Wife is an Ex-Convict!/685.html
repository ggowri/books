        <h1>Chapter 684</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if they were going to reverse the case, it shouldn&rsquo;t have happened so soon! Following the normal procedures..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before Lily could finish, she was interrupted by Harold. "Don't forget who has her back now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily fell silent. 'It's Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The so-called normal procedure's timeline was only applicable to ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. Whatever it is, once the news is reported, the Atkinson family still needs to put on a show. We can't offend the Reed family over this, got it?" Harold repeatedly warned his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily's delicately manicured nails almost crushed her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had stepped on Grace in front of a lot of media and made a big splash about the fact that Grace killed her sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, what her father said was equivalent to asking her to apologize to Grace publicly. Was that not slapping herself in the face in public?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lily, do you hear me?" Harold's voice was serious. "Don't drag the Atkinson family through the mud. I want the Atkinson family to last!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily took a deep breath and said, "Got it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Lily smashed her phone to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now she would have to swallow her pride no matter what. Even if she had to apologize in public for wronging Grace, she could only admit defeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the written judgment in her hand and still found it surreal. 'Did I... Really reverse the case?' The weight of the crime which had weighed upon her was so heavy that she could hardly breathe. She almost thought that she would never be able to reverse the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, who would have thought it would be reversed so quickly? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once, she thought she would cry bitterly when she got the written judgment. After all, the thought of clearing her name was too deep and persistent for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she did get the written judgment, she only felt weary. It was as if she had been held too tightly by this invisible shackle of a crime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that the shackles were gone, she felt like she was out of her element.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Aren't you happy?" asked Jason as he looked at Grace who had seemingly fallen into a trance by the written judgment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'm happy!" Grace let out a long sigh of relief and said, "Maybe this is the best day I've had since my accident! I just feel so tired all of a sudden and want a good sleep. Maybe when I wake up, I'll be the same person I was again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then, have a good sleep," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tilted her head and leaned slightly on his shoulder. "I'm not guilty now, and I can get my lawyer's license back, but... I've left all that professional stuff behind for almost four years. Can I be a lawyer again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can if you want to," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to. I do want to be a lawyer again! I've worked so hard for so many years to become a lawyer. That was my dream. Why wouldn't I?" murmured Grace in a dreamy voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason fell silent and heard Grace's muttering voice in his ear again, "Jason, thank you... If it hadn't been for you, I might never have been able to reverse the case. It's great... To have met you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As her voice grew softer and softer, her eyes closed and she fell asleep.</p></div>
