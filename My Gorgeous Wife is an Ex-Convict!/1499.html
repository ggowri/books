        <h1>Chapter 1497</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace&rsquo;s tears came streaming out. She had forgiven him! In fact, she had already forgiven him long ago!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as his thumb pressed down on the device, the timer displayed the time and it started counting down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace knew that this countdown was for an explosion. Right now, there was only two minutes left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Did she only have two minutes left with Jay?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In these two minutes, Jay could still change his mind! Jay could leave!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Terrence, get someone to pull Jay away!&rdquo; Grace took a deep breath and ordered Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence was stunned for a moment. If he pulled Master Reed away&hellip; it meant that the bombs buried in front of Grace&rsquo;s car would explode immediately!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Whoever dares to pull me away, I&rsquo;ll have their whole family buried alongside me. I mean what I say. Whoever dares, come and try!&rdquo; Jason coldly voiced out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After what he said, the people around remained motionless out of fear, while Terrence was left in a difficult position!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Terrence, you can leave. There&rsquo;s no need to stay by my side,&rdquo; Jason said and then moved his gaze toward Grace, &ldquo;Grace, I&rsquo;m doing this out of my own volition. I&rsquo;m doing it willingly.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Willingly? However, she did not want him to die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, an idea came to Grace&rsquo;s mind. Actually, this problem could be solved. She had another choice. She looked at her hand that was tied to the handbrake and came to a decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;My babies, I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; Mommy is being selfish. &ldquo; Grace lowered her head and muttered, her gaze moving toward her bulging belly. &ldquo;I want some company&hellip; but Mommy loves Daddy a lot. And I don&rsquo;t want Daddy to die.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace took a deep breath, her fingers clutching onto the handbrake tightly. She faced Jason and said, &ldquo;Jay, it&rsquo;s enough. What you&rsquo;ve done for me, it&rsquo;s enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason&rsquo;s eyes widened as he realized something. He shouted loudly, &ldquo;Grace, no! I don&rsquo;t give you permission to do so, you hear me?!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace&rsquo;s hand had already pulled on the handbrake forcefully at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, the car went in reverse. More of the car was slowly suspended in the air with the car tilting backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;I forgive you, but it&rsquo;s not because of our children.&rdquo; Grace looked at the handsome yet pale face. On his face, there was terror, panic, and pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was the man she loved the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;So, please keep living!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, she could feel the whole car slipping downward. Through the front windscreen, she could see the azure sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was selfish, so selfish to the point she was using the lives of three children in exchange for Jay&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However&hellip; Even though she knew it was selfish, she still did it! She had picked that man up from the streets, but after that, he gave her a home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew that for a period in the future, he would be depressed.</p></div>
