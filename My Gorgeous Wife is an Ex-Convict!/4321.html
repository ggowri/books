        <h1>Chapter 4319 Decision</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I stood at the crossroads of my life, I knew that I had to make a decision. It was a pivotal moment, one that would shape my future and determine my fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath and closed my eyes, trying to clear my mind of all distractions. I knew that this decision would not only affect me but also those around me. I couldn't afford to make a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, I opened my eyes and made my choice. It was a difficult one, but I knew it was the right path for me. I couldn't let fear or doubt hold me back any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a newfound determination, I set off on my chosen path, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. This was my decision, and I was ready to embrace it with all my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At some point?" Chandler suddenly chuckled self-deprecatingly. "So tell me, at which point did you fall in love with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was speechless, at that moment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that she had fallen in love with him, but it was more like she started to love him after getting to know him and all the little things about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These little details, however, cannot be easily explained in just a few words!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really want to know when and how I fell in love with you, I can take my time and tell you all about it. I can talk for as long as you want, but first, will you leave this place with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staying here at the Quentin family's place for even a moment longer made her feel like he could summon the Quentin family's people at any time as if they were some kind of cursed creature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, she didn't want him to take this risk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler slowly lowered his gaze and said, "I will explain the situation to the Quentin family and have them send you away. This is a deal between me and the Quentin family, so please don't get involved anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt a pang of pain, he didn't believe a word she said!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in the following days, Chandler left, leaving Tina alone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she tried to leave the room, she was stopped by the security personnel of the Quentin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, she can now freely move around in the room, but she can't go anywhere else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to see Lornell!" Tina exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This actually worked. Half an hour later, Lornell appeared in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When was Chandler supposed to release the Gu worms as agreed with the Quentin family?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After his body examination, Lornell said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When will the results of his physical examination be available?" Tina asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today," Lornell said with a half-smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was suddenly taken aback, "Are we going out today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If nothing unexpected happens, the ritual to summon the Gu worms should take place in about two or three days," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ritual?" Tina exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's call it a ritual, shall we? Do we really have to say surgery? After all, although it involves drawing some blood and performing some procedures on his body, there's no need for an actual incision. He'll just have to take the Quentin family's secret medicine. Whether he can make it through and how many side effects he'll have, it all depends on his luck," Lornell said, then turned to Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must have failed in your conversation with him. He has already greeted my grandfather. I can escort you out now. The deal you mentioned before can be considered null and void," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to!" Tina exclaimed. "Now that I'm already in the Quentin family, I want to take Chandler with me when I leave. Don't forget, you promised to help me with my affairs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina emphasized the word "assist" on purpose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell frowned, "If we do this, there's no turning back. Are you sure you really want to do this? Chandler doesn't even believe you have feelings for him now. Is it necessary for you to do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you believe it or not, it's his business. I'll just do what I want to do!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, she didn't want him to take on such a huge risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell looked at Tina with a determined expression. After a moment, he said, "I can give you the medicine, but whether or not you want to drug Chandler is up to you. And remember, you must never mention my name afterward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He definitely didn't want to be chased by Chandler!</span></p></div>
