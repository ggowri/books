        <h1>Chapter 1647</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With red and swollen cheeks, Irene Lynch left Reed Residence, full of hatred and jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace let her two children wash up and tucked them into bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper casually said good night and kissed her mother and brother before falling asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After his sister fell asleep, Mick Reed solemnly told Grace, "You're my only mommy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned for a moment. Then, she felt a little sorry for her son's precocity after coming to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is he worried Irene Lynch will replace me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't worry, Daddy won't let another woman be your mommy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one seemed to ponder over it for a moment after hearing that. He nodded and said good night to Grace before falling asleep as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help but smile as she watched the faces of her two sleeping children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No matter what it takes, I'll protect my kids, my family, and... the man who loves me so deeply!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she returned to the bedroom, Grace saw Jason with his eyes closed and brows furrowed. He was pressing his hands on both sides of his forehead. She hurried forward and asked, "What's the matter? Are you having another headache?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her voice seemed to make his body tremble slightly before he opened his eyes suddenly. Those dark peach blossom eyes stared straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For a moment, Grace froze. His eyes were tinged with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's come&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before she could ask him, he got up and hugged her hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help asking, "Jay, are you having another headache?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was silent for a moment before muttering, "Yes, my head&rsquo;s hurting again&hellip;&rdquo; During the headache, he recalled how he had ordered people to guard her room. Besides the maids, he had also sent many bodyguards to follow her whenever she moved around the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she was pregnant, he had gone beyond taking the normal extra precautions taken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It... was as if he was not giving her the slightest chance of leaving him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Was I afraid she would leave?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Or... did she want to get away from me? Was that why I assigned so many people to keep an eye on her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when he tried to give it further thought, his head hurt like countless needles were stabbing his brain, preventing him from thinking further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Have you taken your medicine?" Grace asked quickly, knowing that Dr. Guzman had prescribed him medicine to relieve his headaches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't want to take them," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But you'll be in pain for a long time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, I want to regain those lost memories. I want to remember everything about us," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's alright even if you don't remember. At least we're together now, right? I told you, I can tell you about the things you can't remember."</p></div>
