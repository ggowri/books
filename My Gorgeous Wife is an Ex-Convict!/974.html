        <h1>Chapter 973</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could Stella give up? She wanted to show her thoughtfulness, so she practically forced the glass into Brian's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian's hand shook so violently that most of the water in the glass spilled out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was stunned. He tried to hold the glass, but it shook even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not the glass that trembled but his hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes were fixed on his hand that was holding the cup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never felt so flustered before. It was as if his body... was instinctively telling him he could not lose her no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper found Grace at the police station. At first, he thought Grace would have gotten hurt, but things were better than he thought. She was alive and kicking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry to have worried you. My phone got trampled on, so I couldn't call you. I don't remember your phone number either. I finally called you by taking out my phone card and plugging it into another phone, but it took a little time," Grace said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper asked with confusion in his eyes, "What exactly happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"While I was waiting for you, I realized a key point. All of a sudden, this guy came up to me with a spray can wanting to attack me, but fortunately... Uh, someone was able to tackle the guy just in time and bring him over to the station." Grace paused a little when she talked about the person helping her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she did not expect two men to burst out of the shadows and overwhelm him almost instantaneously. She was so shocked that she dropped her phone and crushed it with her own foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The two men&hellip;' She later learned from them that they were the people Jason had sent to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, she had been having a vague feeling that he had sent people to watch over her. Otherwise, he would not know her every move so clearly. It was not until then that she knew for sure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men quickly took the man to his car and were going to take him to the police station. She followed them as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was going to call Chase Harper from the car, but after some time on the road, she realized that her phone was broken. After some delay, she finally called Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's great that you're alright. You should know that when the crown prince of the entertainment industry called Hart something knew that you were missing, he interrogated Elise Dean. It was like&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Chase Harper could finish, a figure suddenly rushed into the police station. The figure rushed in so fast that it bumped into an aluminum alloy shelf nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the man seemed to feel no pain. His eyes just stared at a thin figure not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those dark phoenix eyes seemed to want to imprint that figure into his mind and blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's her! There she is! She's fine! She's not missing!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian felt as if he was relieved. The nerves that had been tense finally relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's here! She's here!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha... Hahaha..." He could not help laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, his eyes met the almond-shaped eyes that were looking his way after hearing his laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt like a blow to the heart, and Brian could not help pressing his hand against his heart.</p></div>
