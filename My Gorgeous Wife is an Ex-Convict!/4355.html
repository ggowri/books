        <h1>Chapter 4353 Dining Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Harley immediately pulled Calvert into the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people outside exchanged glances, then looked at Laurel, whose face was flushed with anger. After a while, someone who usually had a good relationship with Laurel stepped forward and said, "Miss Hart must have said that because she was too angry. If you and your parents go to the Hart family and apologize, it should be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurel could only nod resentfully, her gaze fixed on the private room door that Harley had just entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe that Harley had brought a man to dinner. Could it have been that this man was the real reason behind the end of the engagement between the Hart family and the Quentin family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe he should have figured out who that man was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the private room, Harley looked at the bewildered Calvert and said, "Just ignore what that guy just said, treat it like he was talking nonsense, don't worry about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stared blankly at Harley, wanting to speak but hesitating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Harley asked, "Did I say something incorrect just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Calvert quickly said, "I just didn't expect you to say..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert felt a bit embarrassed to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley suddenly realized, "Are you referring to the term 'fart'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked extremely awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Harley was quite nonchalant, "I'm not like those rich daughters you see in movies or TV shows. If you spend more time with me, you'll find that I'm no different from ordinary people, except maybe my family is a bit wealthier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps if Calvert had spent more time with her, he would have realized that her personality was actually quite ordinary. She was neither particularly noble and elegant, nor was she capricious and willful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can that be, you're not ordinary at all," Calvert said, wondering in his heart if what </span><span>Harley just said meant that he would have a chance to be with her in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't like they went their separate ways after this meal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley chuckled, "Thanks, but my best friends always say that my personality is like plain water."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was for this reason that Lornell never fell in love with her, not even the slightest bit of affection that usually exists between a man and a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Lornell, Harley's expression turned gloomy. Then she told herself in her heart to stop thinking about it, she and Lornell were completely over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, what would you like to eat?" Harley changed the subject, pushing the menu towards Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can eat anything," Calvert replied. Everything here felt like a whole new world to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like Harley noticed his discomfort, so she took the initiative to order some dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to feel uncomfortable," Harley said. "I brought you here to eat because I think the food is pretty good. But if you really don't like it here, we can go somewhere else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need!" Calvert quickly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the dishes started to arrive one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was eating quietly, head bowed. On the other hand, Harley was sizing him up while eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the wounds on Calvert's face had healed, revealing his naturally handsome features. Even Harley, who was used to seeing handsome men in the entertainment industry, had to admit that it was indeed an exceptional face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Calvert were to enter the film and television industry, with enough financial backing, he should be able to become famous pretty quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was pretty tall. When standing, Harley was just barely taller than his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stood at around 163 cm tall, while Calvert was probably around 185 cm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his physique, Calvert seemed quite thin and probably didn't have much muscle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you always looking at me?" Calvert's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm thinking about your body..." Harley blurted out, but as soon as the words left her mouth, she realized something was off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink of an eye, she saw Calvert, his face now flushed red.</span></p></div>
