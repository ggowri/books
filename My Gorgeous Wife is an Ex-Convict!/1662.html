        <h1>Chapter 1660</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's handsome face instantly distorted at the thought of it. Jealousy, pain, struggle, and conflict were all over his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman was relieved when he walked out of the Sweeney family&rsquo;s house. When he called Lina and learned that she had safely gotten home, he immediately hurried over to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Fortunately, the incident had died down. Lina's life should also be able to resume to normal now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Anthony Sherman... you can just tell me if you think it's inappropriate for us to be in touch. It's okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He thought of what Lina had privately said to him in the Sweeney family&rsquo;s house. A faint smile flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He found the woman brutally honest sometimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was already 33 years old but still exuded a child-like innocence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe that was why he had wanted to keep in touch with her after their blind date.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We can continue talking to each other. You're also the victim in this incident."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you believe that Hadwin Stephenson and I did nothing in the hotel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I do." That was the answer he gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Yes, he believed her. Knowing her character, she would have told him directly if something was going on between Hadwin Stephenson and her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman's mind flashed back to the time he met Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Their relationship is already history to Lina, but what about Hadwin Stephenson? Is it history to him? Especially now that Hadwin Stephenson and Katherine Jackson have broken off their engagement!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman could not help stopping when he got out of the elevator. It was because he saw a figure standing not far away... Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why is Hadwin Stephenson here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman looked at him in shock. The two men just looked at each other from a distance without speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a while, Anthony Sherman suppressed his shock and walked forward step by step. Just as he was about to pass by Hadwin Stephenson, the man suddenly asked, "Anthony Sherman, are you going to be with Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman stopped and turned to look at Hadwin Stephenson. "That's personal. I'm not obliged to tell you that, Mr. Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was the president of Stephenson Group and even the final winner after the fiasco with the Jackson family. The difference between the two men was striking, but Anthony Sherman was calm and composed when facing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What if I must know?" Hadwin Stephenson asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Stephenson, are you threatening me?" asked Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what if I am?" asked Hadwin Stephenson. The jealousy in his eyes was obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman was silent. He knew he would be throwing straws against the wind if he wanted to go against Hadwin Stephenson. Hadwin Stephenson had countless ways to make him tell him if he really wanted to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And the jealousy in Hadwin Stephenson's eyes... Is he jealous of me? Is it because of Lina?'</p></div>
