        <h1>Chapter 1731</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hello again, Miss Jackson," Hadwin Stephenson said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson took a deep breath. "You figured I'd come to you, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There's no one else you can turn to, is there?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson gritted her teeth in hatred. "I'm here to make a deal. I want to sell the rest of the Jackson family's assets to you at a reasonable price."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson sneered. "What's the matter? I&rsquo;ve already allocated a sum of money to the Jackson family as agreed. Miss Jackson, are you trying to leave me to clean up the Jackson family's mess after failing to make a comeback?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Just tell me if you'll buy them. It's a good opportunity for you to expand the Stephenson family's business. It&rsquo;ll do you no harm if you buy over the Jackson family's assets."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I can choose to buy or not buy them. Even if I don't, I still have ways to expand the Stephenson family's business. The Jackson family will probably end up in bankruptcy then," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how much Katherine Jackson hated it, she knew what Hadwin Stephenson said was true. "I can remove the blood curse on you. Otherwise, you can never be with Lina. If you buy the Jackson family's assets at the price I offer, I'll help you remove the blood curse!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew Hadwin Stephenson was just waiting for her to say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, Hadwin Stephenson looked at her and said with his thin lips, "It's a deal!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">How generous. He did not even bargain with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson was relieved but also filled with disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson agreed. He went through so much trouble to set all of this up, waiting for her to offer him this so he could be with Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was a terrible man. He calculated every step he took and was meticulous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson did not even have to ask Hadwin Stephenson if he was afraid of her going back on her word and refusing to get rid of the blood curse for him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson would not allow her to go back on her word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How wonderful it would be... if he had fallen in love with me?' The idea had crossed her mind more than once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If a man like him had fallen in love with her, he would shelter her from whatever danger there was and do anything for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Unfortunately, the one he loved was Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But Hadwin Stephenson, it's highly risky to remove the blood curse. No one can guarantee that there won't be mishaps. Is it worth it to do this for Lina? As far as I know, she's seeing a man called Anthony Sherman right now," said Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face darkened. "It has nothing to do with you! Katherine Jackson, just do what you have to do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why wouldn't it be worth it to do it for Lina? She means everything to me. If I can never be with her, how is it different from death?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stepped into Dr. Russell's clinic again but did not expect to see Brian here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian was chatting with Dr. Russell in the clinic but froze and stared blankly at Grace when she walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was also stunned when she saw Brian. A moment later, she said, "I'm sorry to disturb you. I think I'd better come another day."</p></div>
