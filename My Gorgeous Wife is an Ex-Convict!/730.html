        <h1>Chapter 729</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a slight twist in her knuckles that he knew was from when her finger bones were crushed in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some fine movements, which might have been easy for her in the past, were laborious for her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was now peeling him an apple with such difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Therefore, she must have me in her heart. She said it before, I'm the only one she loves!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason kept telling himself as his bright eyes just looked at the movements of her hands, as if to tell himself how much she cared about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she finally finished peeling the apple in her hand, Grace breathed a sigh of relief and handed it to Jason, saying, "Alright. Here you go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took the apple and took a bite. The sweet flesh rippled in his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it sweet?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's sweet," he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll have one too." As she spoke, she took another apple, intending to peel it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, he stretched out his long arms and gathered her into his embrace. "Why bother peeling another one?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Eh?" She was stunned for a moment. Then, she watched him nibble off another piece of apple, got close to her lips, and kissed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With the kiss, the flesh of the apple was sent into her mouth, and the sweetness of the fruit rippled in her mouth along with their saliva.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time the kiss was over, Grace's face had turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it sweet?" There was a faint murmur in his voice when it rang in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know what to say, for she could not taste the apple in her mouth and his question was more like he was asking about the kiss than the apple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only nod wildly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so shy that it seemed to please him. He smiled slightly, stroked his fingers over her rosy lips, and rubbed them to and fro.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought if you shook your head, I'd feed you another piece of apple so you could taste it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face got redder. 'Well... Am I tasting the apple or him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It'll be your birthday in a week. Do you have anything you want for a present?" he asked, changing the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Being reminded by him, she suddenly remembered that her birthday was coming. July 22&ndash;Her birthday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had been the only one to celebrate her birthday every year since her imprisonment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On her birthday, Lina would visit her in prison. She would bring a cake, put on electronic candles, and sing her a happy birthday song.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, inmates were not allowed to eat outside food. Therefore, every year, she could only watch while Lina ate the cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, "Grace, when you get out of prison, I'll buy a big cake and we'll eat it together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she thought about Lina, Grace could not help putting a smile on her lips. 'Lina had always been so cute. This time, Lina was finally... Not the only one celebrating her birthday for her.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at the smile on her lips, his eyes narrowing slightly. "What are you thinking of?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just thinking of how Lina had helped me celebrate my birthday previously." She looked at him and said, "I don't want anything in particular. After all, you always give me what I want, and I don't lack anything. If you really want to give me something, then... Perhaps you can buy me a cake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just a cake?" He was a little stunned, not expecting the present she would ask for to be just a cake.</p></div>
