        <h1>Chapter 303</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nonsense! Of course, she was anxious, especially now that she did not know exactly when this fellow would let her go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want my friends and parents to worry," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words seemed to trigger him. His eyes turned cold as he sneered. "You're afraid they&rsquo;ll worry, but did you ever think that I&rsquo;ll worry too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina choked. A hint of guilt flashed across her face. "I... I had an emergency..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Emergency?" He snorted. &ldquo;Your emergency is to come back and help your friend with her case? You didn't even give me a heads up... Did you only take me as a fling from the very beginning?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina knew it was her fault. She was traveling abroad to visit the school she was going to study in the future when she had met him by chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the time, she had no idea what was going to happen between them. They just made a natural connection. It was like getting acquainted with a compatriot in a foreign country.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would take her to the local scenic spots and eat some local specialties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She enjoyed herself those few days. She had also thought about finding him after completing the formalities of studying abroad in China. Then, she could stay abroad for four years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had always defined him as a friend, but it was not like she was not attracted to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, his looks were just her type!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His handsome face had a kind of feminine beauty&mdash;delicate features, fair skin, and ink-stained brows and eyes. People would be attracted to him even if he just stared at them coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A man like this is a weapon of mass destruction for women!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina commented to herself. Had she not almost fallen for him back then? Fortunately, she caught hold of herself in time and did not let that attraction turn into action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she never considered getting into a long-distance relationship. She knew that he had grown up abroad. She had conservative parents and was an only child, so they would not allow her to marry abroad. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, he was passionate and clingy to her back then. She thought he was naturally hospitable because of the influence of growing up abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, looking at him now, he was not what she thought he was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The most important thing was that he was so handsome that she could not help but to have a crush on him. It was just like when you would appreciate some idols with good looks, but you would never have plans to stay with them for a lifetime or even bear their children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, you might not be up to their standards. Even if you were, you had to be someone outstanding to keep them around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Lina considered herself appearance-obsessed, she usually just looked and would not have any funny ideas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're... not just a fling." Lina licked her lips and could not help but defend herself. "Besides, I'm the one who was taken advantage of!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it?" He stood and approached the chair in which she was sitting on. He bent to stare at her with his dark eyes and said, "You slept with me all night, and then the next day you left without saying goodbye. You even told me you want to study at M University. It turns out there's no one like you at M University. You've made a fool out of me with all your lies, and now you're telling me you're one who was taken advantage of?"</p></div>
