        <h1>Chapter 3496</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Veronica feels an indescribable chill in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, did you hear me? You must tell the police that Lionel is innocent. You can't let your brother go to jail!" said Archer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, it was Lionel who called and took us to the private room at the nightclub that night. He also drugged me and Jasper. Do you really think he's innocent?" Veronica looked at Lionel and spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer was suddenly speechless and didn't know what to say for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rosalind said, "Lionel must have been threatened by those bad people! No matter what, he couldn't have done something as terrible as kidnapping. Anyway, now that you're safe, you can't let him go to jail!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The words was said so casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica turned her head and looked at her stepmother coldly. "Do you think I'm fine, so you can just pretend nothing happened? Being drugged and tied up in the wilderness is nothing? Almost being violated is nothing? Having a gun pointed at my head is nothing? Do you think all of these are nothing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rosalind was left speechless by these questions and could only manage to say, "But...you can still walk and stand, can't you? Your brother is the one who's been detained and has lost his freedom..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that enough talking?" a voice interrupted Rosalind's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's cold expression made Rosalind and Archer shiver with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After spending many years together, both of them naturally knew what kind of personality Mason had. If Mason is really angered at this moment, their son won't be able to come out of jail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them chuckled awkwardly. Archer said, "Um... Mason, your Auntie Rosalind is also worried about Lionel. Actually, she's very worried about Veronica too! She hasn't slept well since last night and has been worried about Veronica's injuries. When she heard that Veronica wasn't seriously injured, she breathed a sigh of relief. We were actually planning to go to the hospital later to see Veronica, but who knew you guys would come here just in time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica found these words even more ironic. If her father and stepmother were really worried about her, how could they not have come to the hospital yesterday?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though they originally planned to go to the hospital to see her, it was probably just for the sake of her younger brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, let's go," Veronica said softly, lowering her gaze and turning to Mason beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." He responded and took her hand, intending to pass by the Archer couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, Veronica, where are you going? Are you going back to the hospital?" Archer asked in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have been discharged from the hospital and will be staying with the Reed family for a while," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh? The Reed family?" Archer looked embarrassed. After all, his son was suspected of kidnapping Jasper from the Reed family. It was natural that they didn't feel comfortable going to the Reed family. If their daughter had to stay with the Reed family, it would be troublesome for them to see her. If they had to ask their daughter to plead for them, it would be even more difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As for Veronica, Lionel's matter, you have to..." Rosalind's words were cut off halfway by the look Mason gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the other person was just a young boy, his cold and sweeping gaze made one feel a chill running down their spine. It was as if, if she said anything more, not only would her son end up in jail, but she herself would be doomed as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason left with Veronica, and the Barlow couple stared at the closed elevator doors, looking at each other in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Lionel... What should we do?" Rosalind said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know, it's because you gave birth to a good son!" Archer said unkindly. At the moment, besides worrying about his son, he was also concerned about the relationship between the Reed family and the Barlow family. If the Reed family really broke ties with the Barlow family, what would happen to his many businesses?</p></div>
