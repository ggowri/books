        <h1>Chapter 3934</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How do you prove that there's a possibility?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't mind me offending you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's words were not finished yet when Mick said, "Go ahead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" She blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can offend me. I also want to know if I really like you," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy took a deep breath. Since he had said that, she would go for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Mick really had some feelings for her, even if it was just a little bit... as long as she could seize the opportunity, maybe she could use Mick to get justice for her mother and make Clarissa pay the price she deserved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter what - she was willing to pay any price!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy slowly leaned towards Mick, their faces getting closer and closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's beautiful peach blossom eyes narrowed slightly, but he didn't say anything. Instead, he stared straight at Nancy as she leaned in closer and closer to his face, then kissed his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She awkwardly sucked on his lips and explored with her tongue, wanting to get closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Mick, this kind of intimate kiss was unfamiliar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although many women had shown interest in him, he never liked them getting too close and never wanted to engage in any intimate actions with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of this, even his family suspected that he had some kind of problem with his sexual orientation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, being kissed by Nancy like this didn't make him feel disgusted. Instead, he felt a trembling sensation that spread from his spine, and his lips unconsciously opened, allowing her to deepen the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time the kiss ended, Nancy's face was already flushed. After all, this was her first time kissing a man like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you hate me kissing you?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't hate it," Mick replied. "But just because you don't hate it, does that mean I like you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you wouldn't let other women kiss you like this, right?" Nancy said. After all, there were rumors about Mick having no "love history."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were even gossip online saying that some women had tried to kiss Mick while he was drunk, but he had pressed their heads down on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So some people joked that it was harder to kiss Mick than to reach the sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Nancy had kissed Mick like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she didn't know if Mick had kissed anyone else before, at least he was willing to kiss her and didn't resist during the process. So she must be somewhat special.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as she was special to him, she would try her best to seize this opportunity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just because it didn't happen before doesn't mean it won't happen in the future," Mick sneered lightly. "If you think that a kiss is enough to prove that I like you, then that proof is too weak. For me, a kiss doesn't represent all those meanings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then how about dating me for a while!" Nancy's heart was pounding as she spoke these words. Only she knew how nervous she was, afraid of being rejected by the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dating?" Mick's eyes flickered as he looked at the person in front of him.</p></div>
