        <h1>Chapter 4372 Not Falling For Anyone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Harley and Karen parted ways, Harley dialed Lornell's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few rings, Lornell's voice came through the phone, "What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> here's the thing, I heard someone snapped a photo of me and my friend and is trying to sell it around. I was wondering if you've bought it," Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I bought it," Lornell's voice sounded nonchalant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback. Did he really buy it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much did you spend? I'll pay you back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a scoffing voice of Lornell came from the phone, "Harley, are you going to give me money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly felt a bit awkward. Lornell was already wealthy and didn't care about the small amount of money spent on buying photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you buy those photos?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing, I just want to know, what exactly is your scandal?" Lornell said calmly, "Harley, you broke off our engagement, can you really fall for someone else in such a short time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pursed her lips, "I'm not in love with anyone else right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? </span><span>So</span><span> when do you plan to fall in love with someone else?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley couldn't help but notice something odd in Lornell's tone: "When I meet someone I can love in the future, I will naturally fall in love again. I'm not sure when that will be, but I also hope that you can find someone truly worth loving. Even though we couldn't make it to the end, I still hope you can find happiness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was speaking sincerely when suddenly, a scream came from the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback, "What's going on? What happened on your end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing, just someone got a bit hurt," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it serious?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not serious, just a minor injury," Lornell replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Quentin family was renowned for their medical skills. So, even if someone got hurt, it should have been pretty easy for them to handle, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good. Since you bought those photos, can you give them to me?" Harley asked, after all, those were her pictures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For you?" Lornell's voice rose slightly, "You want these photos?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mhm</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do it this weekend then. As for the specific location, I'll text you the details later," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Harley responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call ended and Lornell put down his phone, looking up at the reporter not far away who was gagged. The scream just now was the reporter breaking free and making a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell stepped forward, instructing his subordinate to remove the gag from the reporter's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporter quickly pleaded, "Mr. Quentin, please spare me, I promise I won't do it again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell gave a cold smile, "I'm not planning to take your life. You sell photos, I give you money. Isn't that a fair trade?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporter was at a loss for words, filled with unspoken bitterness. If it had truly been a fair deal, he wouldn't be in this state now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I want to do is ask you about what you saw that day. I hope you can tell me the truth. Of course, if I find out you're lying, you'll have to face the consequences," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise to tell the truth!" the reporter quickly assured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's start from when you saw them, what were they doing? What else did you see before </span><span>you took these photos?" Lornell asked calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his voice sent chills down one's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if, should that answer not have satisfied him, there would have been no coming back from the disaster!</span></p></div>
