        <h1>Chapter 3068</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille quickly followed her out of the room. "How long will it take for your leg to heal? You're having trouble moving around now, so you should tell Brian to take care of you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille," Valda took a deep breath and said seriously, "my leg... will never heal. It won't get better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?!" Camille was stunned, her face full of disbelief. "It won't get better? What does that mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It means that my leg will always be lame from now on," Valda said. For the rest of her life, she would be a cripple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille felt as if a huge rock had hit her chest, causing pain and making it difficult for her to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know how you got injured, but you can definitely recover from it. I'm sure of it!" said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's eyes flashed with a hint of desolation as she gave a bitter smile and said, "It's not looking good. My leg has already missed the best time for treatment, so no matter how I try to treat it again now, it's too late!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, it's because of your limp that you don't want Brian?" said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I will meet her, I just haven't figured out how to face him yet," Valda hesitated for a moment and said, "I know he has been looking for me all this time. I have also seen some of his photos online and know that he has been going through a tough time. I never thought of letting him continue to suffer in this pain, I just...just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda hesitated and for a moment, she didn't know how to continue speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That conflicting mindset has been tearing her apart, it was like this before, and now it has become even stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille saw her friend's sad expression and quickly comforted her, saying, "Don't worry. If you haven't figured out how to face him yet, take a few more days to adjust your emotions before meeting him. You don't even know how much he wants to see you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda bit her lip and pulled back her lame right foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille sensed her friend's insecurity and comforted her by saying, "Don't worry about your legs. Even if they don't get better in the future, Brian will still be with you. I've seen how much he misses you these days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay!" Valda interrupted her friend, "Stop talking, Camille. I'm sorry for only letting you know now that I'm still alive. As for what happened between Brian and me, I will deal with it on my own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, so where do you live now?" asked Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I live in a nearby small hotel, where you don't need an ID to check in," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, it's like those cheap hotels. Camille understood the situation well. "Why don't you stay at my place first? I'm worried about you being alone in your current state. Besides, I finally get to see you and there are so many things I want to talk to you about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda thought for a moment, nodded and said, "Okay."</p></div>
