        <h1>Chapter 1060</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, since Grace was taken away by Jason, there's no need to worry. They were a couple, after all. Even if they&rsquo;ve broken up, they look..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella stopped when she realized that Brian was not even listening to her! It was as if she was invisible to him and all he could think about was Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella clenched her teeth. 'What's so good about Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is everyone fighting for Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I won't let Grace take away my happiness!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace got down from the car, she found the place to be unfamiliar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A bamboo forest surrounded the large oriental-style house, and the house looked as if it had been there for years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bamboo forest seemed ancient, making people feel as if they were lost in time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, why did you bring me here?" Grace suddenly felt panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? To lock you up, of course," he said, pulling her away as he walked into the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was something antique about the house's design. Even though some of the places were renovated, the place still had its charm. There were pavilions, bridges, ponds, and lotus flowers too, which were rare at such a time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was a normal occasion, Grace would like such a place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now... She was forced to walk forward as she staggered. No matter how beautiful the place looked, she only felt fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lock me up? What does he mean by that? Could he&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" Grace tried desperately to free herself from Jason, but it was to no avail. His fingers were like steel bars, tugging at her wrist tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stopped in his tracks and turned to look at her before saying, "I used to care about your wishes, but then I realized I'd rather do it my way than let you fall in love with Brian!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he bent down suddenly and carried her in his arms before striding inside!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, put me down!" shouted Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Put you down so you can be with Brian?" he replied with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian and I are not what you think," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said coldly, "Then what is it? Childhood companions who went through thick and thin together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She choked. "Either way, you have no right to bring me here. I want to go back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't go back," he said lightly. He carried her into a large room. The lights in the room were off and it was dark inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt like she was thrown onto a bed. She tried to get up, but the next moment, he was on top of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you can't go back. Since I&rsquo;ve brought you here, I'm not going to let you go." His breath sprayed on her face, but his soft voice made her hair stand on end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean? What do you mean you're not going to let me go?" she asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Have I not made myself clear enough?" he muttered as his lips pressed against her earlobes." I want you to stay here until you fall in love with me again."</p></div>
