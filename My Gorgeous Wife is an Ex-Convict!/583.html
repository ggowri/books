        <h1>Chapter 582</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins immediately caught his wife and shouted at his eldest daughter, "How can you treat your Aunt Riley this way? She's your elder, after all. Come on, apologize to your Aunt Riley!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her father coldly. She used to work hard to gain his approval so that he would treat her like how he treated Evelyn, but it all turned out to be wishful thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, she had given up completely. "Apologize? What do I have to apologize for? You expect me to crane my neck toward her and let her hit me if she wants to hit me? If she wants to scold me or even my mother, I have to let her? Do I have to be more explicit about who wronged my mother in the first place?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flash of embarrassment on Tony Cummins's face, but then, amid Melinda Riley's screams, he said, "So what if Aunt Riley hits you? Why don't you tell me the dirty deeds you've done to your little sister? If it hadn't been for you, she wouldn't have been dumped."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sneered. "Why don't you ask her what she did?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What dirty deeds can your sister do? Come on, apologize to your Aunt Riley!" yelled Tony Cummins angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley just kept yelling, "She hurt me. I'm going to report it to the police. I'm going to sue her for hurting me! With intent to murder!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace paid no attention to the couple. She turned to Kyla and said, "I'm sorry, my personal affairs have affected the restaurant's business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing," replied Kyla. She had started evacuating the customers one by one just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins watched as his eldest daughter ignored them. Feeling at once that his authority as a father was being challenged, he rushed straight ahead and was going to hit Grace again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to get out of the way when suddenly a figure pulled her straight back. That person kicked Tony Cummins with one foot, sending him to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins dizzily tried to get up but was quickly pinned down by a man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley was stunned by the incident and subconsciously screamed, "What are you trying to do? You're hitting someone in broad daylight. I'm calling the police! I'm calling the police!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's great. Call the police, Terrence!" A cold voice rang in the small restaurant, making everyone shudder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Standing behind Jason, Terrence, who was his private secretary, took out his phone and called the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only now did Tony Cummins and Melinda Riley discover that it was Jason who had just kicked Tony Cummins!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why... Was Jason here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them were confused! Having heard from Evelyn that Grace worked in a small restaurant, they thought Jason did not care about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if he took her seriously, would he let her deliver food for a small restaurant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They came here to take revenge for their little daughter. Who would have thought that they would have to face this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to teach my daughter a lesson. It's&hellip; It's none of your business. Can the rich stop others from teaching their daughters a lesson?" Tony Cummins struggled and tried to break free from the bodyguard who was pinning him down, but he failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace's my woman. Whoever touches her will be an enemy of the Reed family!" Jason spat out these words, making Tony Cummins and Melinda Riley gasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two people who were overwhelmed with fury finally realized what the Reed family and Jason stood for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was more than just money!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they became enemies with the Reed family, their lives would not be enough to compensate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked somewhat unexpectedly at Jason who was holding Grace in his arms. A man like this must love Grace deeply if he was willing to say that.</p></div>
