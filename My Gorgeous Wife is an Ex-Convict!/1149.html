        <h1>Chapter 1148</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In this case, it was better to strike and make them scared!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz's face became extremely pale. Grace continued saying, "Just like what you said, I&rsquo;ve snagged Brian. Even if I can't join the Hart family, it shouldn't be difficult to ask Brian to take you on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz clenched her teeth, unable to retort. Indeed, it would be simple enough if Grace wanted Brian to deal with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even with the way Brian treated Grace now, Grace probably did not have to ask for anything at all. She could just give the recording to Brian and Brian would make a move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz trembled at the thought of this. She was already in such a predicament. If Brian wanted to deal with her, she probably could not even stay in Emerald City anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace paid no more attention to Andrea Schwartz and walked out of the pantry with her instant coffee in hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she got back to her seat, Lina's message popped up on WeChat. Grace opened it and saw her best friend's WeChat message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina: [Grace, are you really dating Brian?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace: [???]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another one mentioning Brian. It seemed like everyone was talking about her and Brian today, but she did not know why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately sent another message: [Are you guys not together? The video's out, don't tell me you have no idea about it!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Lina sent a video link. Grace clicked on the link and was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The video showed her falling asleep on a bus with Brian standing by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The videographer responsible for this had probably sat behind her on the bus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the video, Brian kept his hand between her head and the glass window, carefully protecting her head from hitting the glass window due to the bus&rsquo; motions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were slightly lowered, his phoenix gaze gently gazing at her as a smile appeared on the corners of his mouth. It made him look a lot more friendly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... a scene she had no idea of! Grace stared blankly at the video on her phone, unable to come to her senses for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A WeChat message notification from Lina chimed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina: [Hey, Grace, what the hell is going on? The video is going viral today.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Lina also told her some background information regarding the video's popularity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person who shot the video yesterday posted it online and said they were so envious of the sleeping woman in the video. They said if they had such a sweet boyfriend, they would marry him right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This person&rsquo;s Twitter account only had a hundred fans at first, but their followers suddenly increased because of the video. Then, someone recognized the man in the video as the crown prince of the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the video went viral immediately. The person&rsquo;s followers on Twitter rose to more than 100,000 and it was still growing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the videographer had deleted the video because they were worried, the video was already reposted to other places. They could not stop it even if they wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only be glad that she was asleep, and because of the camera angle, the video did not capture her whole face but a small part. Only those who knew her well could recognize her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied to Lina's message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace: [I didn't know about this video until now. I'm not dating Brian. I just think of him as my childhood friend.]</p></div>
