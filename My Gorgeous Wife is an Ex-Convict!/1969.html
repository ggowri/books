        <h1>Chapter 1967</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then she laughed at herself for overthinking. It was unknown whether he would forgive her, let alone be madly in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I'm not walking away. I'm only leaving because you won't forgive me. After all, we have a one-month deal," Lina explained meekly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For some reason, she felt guilty under his glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We did agree on a month, but are you going to give up in a month? Can't you just keep trying? Or am I not worth it?" Hadwin Stephenson roared in one breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he heard that she would find another man and form a new family, he was unspeakably annoyed. He could not imagine how he would feel when she built a family with another man and called another man her husband, while his child would call another man their father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was dumbfounded. 'Does he want... me to keep on pestering him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't... know what you mean. Could you be a little more specific?" muttered Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson took a deep breath and glared at Lina. "Lina, just keep pestering me for the rest of your life. You're not allowed to leave as long as this life isn't over!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was shocked by what he said. 'For the rest of my life... I'm not allowed to leave? Does he mean...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at her dumbfounded appearance, he reached out his arms as he approached her. Bending his head, he kissed her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His lips still tasted of cake&mdash;sweet and delicious... Lina stared blankly at the face right in front of her, her mind almost turning blank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the kiss ended, Lina still had not come to her senses. She asked in a daze, "Why... Why did you kiss me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Think of the answer yourself!" He snapped, ate the rest of the cake, and left the house!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson rubbed his forehead once he got into the car. No matter how he denied it and avoided it, his body's reaction and his emotions could not fool anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She's the only one who can affect my mood so easily. I can't let go of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Who exactly am I punishing by not forgiving her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... this time, she came from Emerald City and wants to get back together with me. Is it because of the child, the guilt of having misunderstood me previously, or does she really love me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She keeps telling me that she loves me. Can I trust her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I'm afraid of losing her again! If I was forced to do it the first time, then did the second time happen because of all the misunderstandings or she just didn't love me enough? Was that why she could let me go so easily?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Will there be a third time, then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She already misunderstood me this time. Life is so long. Will there be another misunderstanding? Or even if there&rsquo;s no misunderstanding, will we separate again because she doesn't love me enough?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What will I do then?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson slowly closed his eyes. Once the car stopped, the driver at the front said, "Mr. Stephenson, we're here." Hadwin Stephenson opened his eyes again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Outside the car was an impressive mansion. It was... the mansion where Emily Flowers lived!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson walked out of the car. Several cars followed his. A row of strong bodyguards got out of the cars and followed Hadwin Stephenson into the mansion.</p></div>
