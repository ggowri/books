        <h1>Chapter 4106</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of going back to the Stephenson family, Tina went straight to Chandler's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler hadn't returned yet, but she could unlock the door with her fingerprint and come and go freely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina sat on the sofa in the living room, waiting for Chandler while thinking about what Weldon had said to her today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A child...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the placenta of a child could really be used as medicine to completely get rid of the worms in Chandler's body, should she have a child earlier?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she originally wanted to be mentally prepared enough to become a mother before having a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if it was for the sake of solving Chandler's health problems, then it would be good to have a child earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, it would be her and Chandler's child, and she would love this child very much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina? Why are you here?" Chandler's voice suddenly sounded in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina suddenly snapped out of it and realized that Chandler had already come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I missed you. I'm staying at your place tonight," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your parents will worry," Chandler said. "Let's have dinner at my place and I'll take you back later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I want to stay at your place," Tina pouted. "And I've already talked to my parents about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler looked at her indulgently. "Alright, it's up to you. What do you want to eat tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anything is fine!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The dinner was cooked by Chandler himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was also very impressed with Chandler's cooking skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hmm, her fianc&eacute; was simply a jack of all trades, and he was like a fierce dragon in bed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Okay, she got a little carried away! Tina's face turned slightly red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why aren't you eating? Not hungry?" Chandler asked because she had been sitting there without eating much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No...it's delicious! I'm just thinking about something," Tina hesitated and tentatively said, "I ran into Weldon today and he gave me the final photos from our last shoot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler frowned, seeming to dislike her meeting with Weldon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't need to pay attention to him," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But the favor he asked me for was to give him a ring with a red and blue gemstone if I ever saw one at the Hunter family's place. He also said that the ring wasn't worth much, he just wanted it as a keepsake," Tina said. "Have you seen this ring before? Does it have any special meaning?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> To Chandler's surprise, his face changed when he heard this. "Did he say anything else?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina pursed her lips and replied truthfully, "He also mentioned the issue of the gu worms and why I have to have a child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's face turned pale and his eyes were fixed on Tina. "What did he say exactly?" he asked, his voice trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At that moment, Tina felt like his voice was shaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "He said that I have to have a child and that the placenta can be used as medicine to completely get rid of the gu worms in your body," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's face had turned gray and defeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She now knew all of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He had planned to explain everything to her when the time was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But now... everything had happened so suddenly.</p></div>
