        <h1>Chapter 1694</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The policewoman had just finished talking when Jason turned around and walked right up to Irene Lynch. He grabbed her by the collar and yelled, "How dare you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why wouldn't I?" Irene Lynch burst into laughter. It was like she had anything to lose. "Jason, do you think I'm just a parasite of the Reed family who dares not do anything without your permission?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes narrowed as they turned colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I hate that I didn&rsquo;t push Grace out of the window just now. It would be great if Grace died!" Irene Lynch said hatefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who are you to hate her?" Jason's hand clasped Irene Lynch's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch's face turned red from getting her breathing restricted. "Why... Why can't I hate her? If she... If she hadn't shown up, I... I wouldn't have ended up like this... I not only hate her... but I... I hate you too. Why would you... give me hope and... and then let me down?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As Jason's fingers tightened, Irene Lynch's voice got smaller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The policewoman panicked and hurried over to pull Jason's hand away, but his fingers were like steel bars that could not be pulled away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said anxiously, "Jay, don't do this! I'm alright. I'm really alright. Don't commit a crime for someone like her. It's not worth it!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His body stiffened, and the strength in his hands eased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace gripped Jason's wrist. "Jay, let go of your hand. I don't want you to do things you shouldn't do because of someone like her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He turned to look at her face. "But she was going to kill you just now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The law will bring her to justice, and she'll live to atone for her sins in prison! I know you&rsquo;ll listen to me, right?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Those dark eyes gazed at her for a long time. He slowly released his hold and muttered, "Yes, I'll listen to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Yes, he would listen and do whatever she wanted even though he could not wait to kill Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if he would be arrested for it, he could not care less. He would not allow anyone to do such atrocious things to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch managed to save her life for now, and she staggered backward. She would probably have fallen limply to the ground if not for the policewoman supporting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, there was no relief of having survived on her face. There was only embarrassment and pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Grace who made Jason let go in the end!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason... The man who ruled Emerald City was willing to listen to a woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She even had the feeling that Grace was the superior one while Jason was lowly in front of Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Did Jason love Grace that much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch felt devastated. 'Why didn&rsquo;t I realize this before? I wouldn't have done all this if I knew how important Grace is to Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as the policewoman was about to lead her away, Irene Lynch suddenly yelled, "Jason, you did this to me! You did this to me! Why did you help Oriel and me in the first place? Why did you adopt Wanna? I wouldn't have ended up like this if you hadn&rsquo;t done that!&rdquo;</p></div>
