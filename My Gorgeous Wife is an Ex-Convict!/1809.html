        <h1>Chapter 1807</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why did you rush out to shield me and stand up for me?" he asked in a mutter when they were done playing the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're my friend. Of course, I'm going to help you! Besides, they're wrong. It was your mommy who did the wrong thing, not you. Why should they criticize you?" she said justly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Friend?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at her blankly. They were not friends!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the Reed family's living room, Grace looked at Lily's son and could not help sighing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The boy she previously admired for playing the piano so well was unexpectedly Lily's son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You must be William. We've met before. I'm Mick and Jasper's mommy. You can call me aunt Cummins," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want to involve the younger generation in the older generation's grudges. Since Jasper insisted on keeping the child in the Reed family, she hoped that the child could live in peace with everyone in the Reed family with no hatred in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, she did not see hatred or anger in his eyes but trepidation instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you have something you want to say to me, go ahead," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William said, "I want to see my mommy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes narrowed instantly, but he heard Grace say, "Okay, I&rsquo;ll arrange for you to see your mommy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they were back in their room, Jason asked, "Are you really going to let that kid see Lily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "The kid is innocent. He just misses his mother. What's more, if I reject his request, the child will end up doing something unexpected if he really wants to see his mother.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll make the arrangements," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, before William could meet Lily, news came that Lily had committed suicide in the detention center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lily had killed herself with a small iron awl. No one knew how it came into her possession, but she had resolutely stabbed it into her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After examining her corpse, the forensic expert said she had been determined to die as her actions were very decisive. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What was even more impressive was that she died with a smile on her lips as if it was a relief!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was momentarily stunned when she heard the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Lily, the woman who changed the course of my life, killed herself?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then again, Lily was once a renowned celebrity. If she went to trial, it would probably be all over the news. How could someone like Lily accept it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was better to commit suicide than to show others her worst side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace had no sympathy for her but she pitied William!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace told the child, his little body quivered and all colors left his face. However, instead of crying, he said to Grace, "I want to see my mommy, may I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at the little one who was in front of her. 'A five-year-old child should already know what life and death mean. Letting a child see a corpse, which is also the corpse of his own mother...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"May I?" asked William as he looked at Grace.</p></div>
