        <h1>Chapter 2662</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "No thanks. The viral post is gone now. Besides, I'm not a celebrity who everyone recognizes. I'll just go out and buy myself dinner or order takeout. You don't have to travel so far to bring me food."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was an hour and a half drive to her best friend's house and back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright then. Be careful. Call me if anything happens. Go to the film set in a few days. I'll inform the director," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After her best friend left, Valda Theller was left alone in the small apartment of about 430 square feet. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Loneliness instantly enveloped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took out her phone and found the name &lsquo;Brian&rsquo; in her contact list. After some hesitation, she made the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s Brian." Brian's cold voice came from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's grip on the phone tightened. "It&rsquo;s Valda Theller... Today... I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re aware that something from my past went viral today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I know." No emotion could be heard from his indifferent tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry this happened. If you think it's inappropriate for me to continue to pretend to be your girlfriend, we can stop right now, or you can tell your friend I lied to you. I'll do anything you want me to do," she quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to make it up to him and not be in his way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then all you have to do is pretend to be my girlfriend and make people think you love me very much. You don't need to do anything else. Don't overthink about the rest. Everything will go back to normal," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze. Though his tone was still indifferent and calm, it gave her a warmth that made her feel secure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you suppress the viral post?" Valda Theller could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." His tone was still as indifferent as usual. It was as if he was only answering a question about whether he had eaten. However, what he did meant so much to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," she said while feeling the urge to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "You're my girlfriend. They're slandering me by slandering you. Where are you? Home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, Camille found a serviced apartment and asked me to stay here for a few days. I'll move back home once this dies down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the address?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then sent Brian the address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll come by and take you to dinner later," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't... we eat here? There&rsquo;s a kitchen where I can cook. There's a mini supermarket nearby, so I can get some groceries. The place I'm currently staying is a little remote. There aren&rsquo;t many restaurants around." In the end, she hesitated and said, "If... you don't mind my cooking..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll come by later," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller breathed a sigh of relief. After the call, she put on a mask and cap. Grabbing her phone and wallet, she went to the supermarket to get some groceries.</p></div>
