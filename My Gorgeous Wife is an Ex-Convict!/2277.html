        <h1>Chapter 2275</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla quickly stood up straight and said to the nurse, "He... He's awake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll call the doctor and have them come and examine him," the nurse said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the nurse left the ward, Kyla looked down at the wrist he was holding. "Will you... let go for a while? The doctor will examine you in a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss kept holding her as if it was the only way to make sure she was safe. "Are you... really alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine. The baby's fine too. Thank you for saving me... and our baby," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flicker of surprise in his eyes that she used the word &lsquo;ours.&rsquo; It was as if she and he were one, not separate individuals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's great... that you and the baby are... okay," he murmured. His already hoarse voice sounded more broken due to the lump in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You hurt your neck. Don't talk so much!" Kyla said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The wounds on his neck were far more serious than hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He obediently closed his mouth, but those dark eyes of his were still looking at her. The hand that held her never loosened its grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when the doctor came to check on him, he still held her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was doing okay after the surgery. The most serious injuries he suffered were the ones on his neck, so he had to speak less and eat liquid food for three days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, you lost a lot of blood this time. Fortunately, most of the blood we transfused to you is your own blood, so there's no problem. But we learned that you&rsquo;ve been getting your blown drawn every month. In your current condition, you won&rsquo;t be able to get your blood drawn for at least half a year,&rdquo; the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression changed. He ignored the doctor's previous instructions to speak less. "I got my own blood transfused to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, your wife told us you had blood stored in Municipal Women's Hospital. Fortunately, we got the blood in time. Otherwise, you would&rsquo;ve been in a dangerous situation as the blood bank didn&rsquo;t have enough of your blood type due to its rarity,&rdquo; the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss's face turned increasingly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I was keeping that blood for Kyla! But they&rsquo;ve used it on me. What do I do when she gives birth? What if she needs blood and we don't have enough...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why... Why would they use that blood on me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That blood should have never been given to me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss became filled with despair. The hand holding Kyla's hands also loosened unconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor and the nurse left. Kyla tried to tuck Martin Weiss in when his voice rang out abruptly. "Why..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't the doctor tell you to speak less? You can say whatever you want after three days," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss continued saying, "Why did you mention the stored blood? That blood shouldn&rsquo;t have been used on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The blood is yours, and it's only right to use it on you, no?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you know that blood is..." He wanted to continue, but her fingers pressed against his lips and stopped all his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss... Enough. That's enough. You've done more than enough for me," she said gently. Her voice was not indifferent and distanced like usual but with a touch of sorry. "Besides, the reason you lost so much blood today was to save me. If you hadn't used the blood, I might have been the one who had to use it."</p></div>
