        <h1>Chapter 366</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man was wearing a suit, accentuating his perfect features. He looked like a prince from a manga. People might not believe that her boyfriend was someone like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina wanted to sigh into the heavens. She recalled what had happened these few days and thought that she was extremely miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything started from that blind date. She thought that since everything had already gone to sh*t, that would be the end of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To her surprise, she was scolded furiously by her mother the moment she got home after the blind date. Her mother questioned her about why she did not tell them that she had a boyfriend. The person who introduced her to the blind date even called her parents and scolded them. They said she embarrassed the entire family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, her parents started to ask her who her boyfriend was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When this happened, Lina denied it, of course. She said he was just a friend who passed by. He knew she did not want to go on the blind date, so he tried to help her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, her parents asked her which friend it was, so she said the name of a guy who was quite close to her. She decided to plan out their statements after this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, before they could do that, Hadwin called her. Before she could answer, her mother snatched her phone away from her hand and started chatting with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, when her mother asked him what was his relationship with her, he answered, &ldquo;Aunty, I am her boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Great. That statement was like a bomb. The entire Sweeney family was in chaos. Mrs. Sweeney invited Hadwin to their house over the phone. Lina wanted to snatch back her phone a few times but was stopped by her father&rsquo;s stern gaze every time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Eventually, when this call ended, Lina was scolded by her parents for two hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You little rascal, what&rsquo;s so shameful about having a boyfriend? Even if your boyfriend is hideous and even if he has a horrible job, the least you can do is tell your family about this. How long were you planning to hide this from us? Did you only plan to tell us if you get pregnant?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;...&rdquo; Lina swore she had never thought about this before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not tell her parents that she was only dating Hadwin just for show and that they would break up after he got his revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she said this, the thing about her exploiting someone before leaving would get dug out once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, she could only accept her faith. Then, she found an appropriate time and invited him back home according to her parents&rsquo; orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had mentally prepared herself. However, when she walked into her residential area, she started to question herself again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just look at Hadwin and look at his family background. Even though he was an illegitimate child, he was the person in charge of the Stephenson family now. He controlled the entire Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps a lot of mothers-in-law would fight for a man like him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why are you looking at me like that? Are you scared that your parents won&rsquo;t like me?&rdquo; Hadwin asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;...&rdquo; Lina rolled her eyes. She was scared that her parents would like him. When they broke up eventually, her parents might fall into depression while she felt nothing at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took in a deep breath like she was accepting her fate. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; She was going to die either way, so since her parents already knew of his existence, they would definitely want to meet him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina led Hadwin into her residential area. When they got to her block, she pressed the elevator.</p></div>
