        <h1>Chapter 709</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A perpetrator telling the victim to forget about the past? What right does Lily have to say this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily's face suddenly turned even paler. "Miss Cummins, I just hope we can make peace with each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think we can ever make peace with each other," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily wanted to say more, but Jason said, "If Grace says she won't forgive you, then no."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Lily trembled and could barely stand still. Sean immediately supported his fianc&eacute;e.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head to face Jason and said, "Jason, I want to hang out somewhere else." She felt uncomfortable facing the two people who had hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," answered Jason. He was about to take her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the two turned around, Sean suddenly said, "Grace, I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace paused in her tracks but did not turn back. It was a sorry that had lost its meaning the moment he agreed to let Lily destroy her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason turned around and glanced coldly at Sean with his deep eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Sean felt a chill rising from the soles of his feet that soon spread quickly through his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look in Jason's eyes seemed to be warning him not to overstep his boundaries, and if he came any closer to Grace, then perhaps he would be greeted with never-ending doom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean&rsquo;s face paled as he looked at the equally pale Lily beside him. "All right, Jason probably just wants to give Grace some credit this time. We were so humble just now, so it should be all right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It should be all right?' Lily did not think so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The last words Jason said to her, "If Grace says she won't forgive you, then no", was definitely nothing simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason will definitely make a move!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, what exactly would he do? It's impossible to guess at all.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she felt was fear and panic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sean, why&rsquo;d you say sorry to Grace just now?" Lily asked after a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean's eyes dimmed. "The accident had nothing to do with her, so I owe her this apology."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you regretting it? Do you regret breaking up with her to be with me?" Lily asked demandingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people were asking this question online, and she had doubts too. It was only now that she finally asked him about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about? How could I regret being with you?" Sean snapped and asked her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Lily's eyes were skeptical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lily, I don't regret it," croaked Sean. Besides, he could not regret it.</p></div>
