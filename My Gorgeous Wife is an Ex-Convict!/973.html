        <h1>Chapter 972</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The entertainment industry had always been a place with overflowing gossip, so everyone started to speculate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper, who caused all this ruckus, was at a loss and still could not come to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... What on earth is Grace's relationship with Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The way Brian looked was as if... the person he loves the most is in danger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Loves the most?' Chase Harper was startled by the words that came to his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Where did I get the idea? Don&rsquo;t they say that the crown prince of the entertainment industry often changes his girlfriends? They also say that he may seem affectionate, but he's in fact heartless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could a man like that have a woman he loves the most?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time Brian arrived at the film studio's security room, all the relevant surveillance footage was ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the surveillance footage, they could see the actress Elise Dean talking to a man wearing a black T-shirt in front of the bathroom. They talked for about half a minute or so before the man left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, Grace's figure appeared on the screen. One could see from the screen that the man in the black T-shirt had quickly followed after Grace and Chase Harper after leaving the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I knew it! This man is fishy!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's phoenix eyes stared closely at the screen when suddenly, Grace, Chase Harper, and the man in the black t-shirt walked out of the shot. There was no more footage!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are no security cameras in the front, so we don't know what happened, but a black car arrived at the scene about three minutes later and drove off immediately!" someone said while fast-forwarding to the scene he just mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian squinted at the car. "Talk to the Ministry of Transport. I want to know where this car ended up going! Call the police too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could Grace be in this car?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart started beating violently. 'What is this feeling?' He did not even dare to imagine what would happen to her if the man had really attacked her and brought her into the car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He dared not think of the consequences!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, is it true that Grace was kidnapped and brought away in a car?" Stella, who had followed Brian to the security room, asked with mock concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Stella was secretly pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's best if Grace was kidnapped. Better yet, I hope she gets killed so that I don't have to worry about Grace telling Brian the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That way, I can keep my role as Brian's savior and stay with Brian fair and square.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If not, it&rsquo;ll be fine even if Grace just gets raped or becomes disfigured. Brian won't want to look at Grace anymore!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pressed his thin lips together and did not answer Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Leave the matter to the police to investigate. The police will find a way. Brian, please calm down and drink some water." Stella thoughtfully poured a glass of water and passed it to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I can't." Brian refused.</p></div>
