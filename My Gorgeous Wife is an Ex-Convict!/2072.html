        <h1>Chapter 2070</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's alright... It only hurts a little. You can continue driving. I want to quickly go home,&rdquo; said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss paled and started the car again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when the car stopped again, Kyla realized that Martin Weiss had not driven to the entrance of her store. Instead, he parked at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't need to come to the hospital. I just..." Before Kyla could finish, Martin Weiss had already carried Kyla out of the car and was hurrying toward the emergency room. Then, he anxiously asked for a doctor to examine her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss even made a call to pull some strings and had the hospital's liver specialist come to the emergency room to examine her. He made it seem like Kyla was in critical condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once the doctors gave her a series of tests, they said Kyla's pain was normal. It would occasionally occur after undergoing liver transplantation. There was no cure for the pain, and it could only be relieved by medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The pain would also disappear with time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After getting the results, Martin Weiss did not feel embarrassed for making such a fuss. Instead, he was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you have any medicine for the pain at home?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, but I don't have it with me today," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Does it happen often?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Not really."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss raised his hand and gently pressed against where Kyla's liver was. Kyla stiffened, wanting to put some distance between them. However, the problem was that she was in a makeshift bed in the emergency room. There was no place for her to retreat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss seemed glad as he said, "It's a good thing your body didn't reject my liver. Sometimes, I even wonder if this is what I live for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was only living so that a part of his body could extend her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla frowned. "Martin Weiss, what on earth do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't you know what I want?" Martin Weiss stared at the person in front of him. "Kyla, your bone marrow saved my life back then, and my liver is also a part of your body now. We share the same blood. There's no way we can separate ourselves from each other!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She trembled a little when she saw him lean forward slightly, his cold face drawing closer and closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, instead of his usual indifference, his face exuded imploration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, your body isn&rsquo;t rejecting my liver, so can you... not reject me so strongly as well? Maybe we can have another chance.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wanted to be by her side for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's impossible between us. Martin Weiss, having nothing to do with each other is the best scenario for us!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's face suddenly paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Kyla's phone rang. She quickly took out her phone. It was a call from her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, why aren't you home yet? Did you find Juliet?" Mrs. Corbyn's voice rang anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah, yes. Someone found the child and took her to the police station. Chase has picked up Juliet, and I'm on my way home now," Kyla replied quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's a good thing you found her. It&rsquo;s very good," Mrs. Corbyn repeated.</p></div>
