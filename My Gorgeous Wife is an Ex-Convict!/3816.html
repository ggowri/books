        <h1>Chapter 3814</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel knew that the timed message that was supposed to be sent from Veronica's phone, which he had set up, was meant to be a message that would provoke Mason. But now it had become a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked down at the message on his phone and his face suddenly changed. While everyone's attention was temporarily focused on Mason, Daniel took advantage of the distraction and suddenly took out a remote control he was wearing and pressed the button hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Daniel was pushed down to the ground by the police around him, and the remote control in his hand fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police picked up the remote control and asked Daniel, "What is this? What were you doing just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha...hahaha..." Daniel laughed wildly, even though his body was firmly pressed to the ground by others, he still desperately lifted his head and stared at Mason, "I want you to regret it! I want you to regret it for a lifetime! It was you who made me lose so much, so I want you to taste the feeling of losing too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason stared at Daniel, "Speak clearly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then listen carefully!" Daniel opened his mouth fiercely with a grimace on his face, "Veronica is locked in the school auditorium, and what I just pressed was the button to explode it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words fell, a burst of explosions suddenly sounded in the old school building, and with the sound of the explosion, a building on one side of the campus also collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The personnel responsible for the explosion were now in a panic, "I...I didn't do anything, I didn't detonate it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's face was twisted with a smile. He had the detonation device in addition to the demolition personnel, so...soon, Veronica would be buried in this old school building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's face turned pale in an instant, and his gaze went straight to the auditorium. Although the explosion just now was not in the auditorium, if it continued to explode...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it quickly, find a way to stop the explosion!" Mason shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We...we can't stop it! The stop button is not working." The personnel stuttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police had already handed over the control switch obtained from Daniel to the personnel, but it was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quickly, how do we stop it!" The police sternly reprimanded Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible to stop it. Once the explosion starts, it can't be stopped! Mason, Veronica is doomed! She will die, all because of your relationship! She died because of you! Haha, what good is your money now? You can't bring people back to life, and you can't stop this explosion..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel continued to shout, but Mason couldn't hear him anymore. In his ears, there was only the terrifying sound of the explosion and the constant sound of the old building collapsing. His eyes were fixed on the direction of the auditorium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there were cries of alarm around him. "Mason! Don't go in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason rushed towards the restricted area, but security personnel and police quickly stopped him. "You can't go in, it's too dangerous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Mason's figure swayed, all those who tried to stop him were left empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as someone was about to grab him, they felt a force kick them, and they fell heavily backwards. The person they were trying to stop, Mason, had already rushed into the campus area.</span></p></div>
