        <h1>Chapter 2580</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe there were some lingering feelings, but they&rsquo;re very faint." Kyla sighed and said, "After I sign the divorce papers, apart from our two children, we&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with each other.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said, "Do you really want to divorce him? If you really love him, we'll find a way to lift his hypnosis. That way, the four of you can stay as a family. Wouldn't that be great?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook his head. "No, I have a bad liver. I had liver cancer and underwent a liver transplant. Giving birth to the baby has put a strain on my liver. Why lift his hypnosis and let him suffer with me when I don't know how many years I have left to live? He has no feelings for me now, so it won&rsquo;t hurt him to divorce me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But won't you regret it?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled. "There are always many regrets in life. It wouldn't be life if there are no regrets. I should be content with this life. I had someone I loved, I have two children, a family, and friends. I can live my life in peace. It's good enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it really good enough?' Amber Mitchell looked down at the little one in her arms. Then, she returned the baby to Kyla. "I&rsquo;ve always believed that we should have fewer regrets. Some regrets can be remedied, while others can never be. Just like Herman. He's gone. I can't make up for my regrets for him, but both you and Martin Weiss are still alive. This regret can be remedied."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Amber Mitchell left, her statement still echoed in Kyla's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some regrets could be remedied, while others could never be!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, how was she going to make up for her regret with Martin Weiss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Kyla arrived at the law firm. They handed her a document. "Miss Corbyn, take a look. This is the agreement drafted according to Mr. Weiss's wishes. If there's something you're dissatisfied with and want to add, we can do so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla opened the document and looked through it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This divorce agreement was favorable to her. The two children would live with her, and Martin Weiss would pay her a generous sum of child support fees every month. Besides that, the figure would gradually increase as the two children grew up. He was even giving her several properties in Emerald City. It was indeed a generous divorce settlement. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was also giving the two children five percent of Weiss Group's shares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not need to pay anything or lose anything after the divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If there was any loss, then perhaps... it was the title of Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, she found Martin Weiss's signature already in the signature column.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, once she signed the agreement and the lawyer processed the divorce, she and Martin Weiss would be officially divorced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn, do you have anything to add to this divorce agreement? If you have no opinion, you can sign your name and we'll take care of the rest. If everything goes well, you and Mr. Weiss will be officially divorced tomorrow. The assets and money stated in the agreement will belong to you immediately."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Kyla looked at the pen in front of her and suddenly realized how difficult it was to pick it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lawyer waited for some time but did not see Kyla take the pen to sign the papers. Hence, they said, "If you're dissatisfied with the conditions, you may voice your suggestions. Mr. Weiss has said that he&rsquo;ll do his best to satisfy you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But it's not money, shares, or houses that I want. It's...' Kyla shouted in her head. Suddenly, an answer came to her.</p></div>
