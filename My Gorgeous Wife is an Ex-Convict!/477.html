        <h1>Chapter 476</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A flash of embarrassment immediately flushed Stella Lindsay's face. What Jason said to her was like a slap in the face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt was visibly annoyed by this. She complained to Grace, "Hey, Grace. Stella has good intentions. Why is your boyfriend so arrogant. He's our guest. Does he want us to worship him like he's our master?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace simply said lightly, "My boyfriend is quite shy. He keeps his distance from people he doesn't know well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt and Stella Lindsay almost choked on their saliva.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shy?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man did not look like he was shy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, when the man gazed lazily at them, they could not help but feel their hearts begin to beat quickly. It was as if they were subconsciously afraid of his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt pursed her lips and did not say anything else. On the other hand, Stella Lindsay shamelessly and insinuatingly asked when Grace and Jason met, how they got together, what Jason&rsquo;s true identity was, what kind of job he had, his family background, and so on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those questions were without a doubt all vaguely dismissed by Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, Stella Lindsay found herself asking questions that seemed to have no substance. Nonetheless, with Jason there, she dared throw a fit. Hence, she forced a smile and asked, "Then what are you working as now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm the food delivery rider of a small restaurant," Grace answered sincerely, showing no signs of inferiority despite her profession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, in Stella Lindsay's ears, Grace sounded like she was in dire straits considering that she used to be a lawyer who had been admired by people as an intellectual person. Grace was now working as a food delivery rider; it was not much different from her previous job as a street sweeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your boyfriend... uh, Mr.Smith didn't help you find another job?" asked Stella Lindsay as she eyed Jason who was sitting next to Grace and fiddling with her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's fingers were long and fair. He had a pair of extremely good-looking hands. At the moment, they were rubbing and squeezing Grace's fingers. Jason was doing so in a gentle, intimate manner that made Stella Lindsay wish he was holding her own hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like the job I have now," said Grace. After all, Kyla and all the other people at the restaurant were nice to her. Not to mention, she was able to meet Nelson through her job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was very kind to her. Whenever he saw her, he would smile at her and hug her. He was very affectionate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because of Nelson's ear problem that Grace felt sympathy for him and wanted to take good care of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace really enjoyed her current working environment. At the very least, no one at the small restaurant looked down at her just because of her time in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Stella Lindsay heard this, she thought that maybe this man called Jason was not that capable. Otherwise, what kind of boyfriend would let his girlfriend work as a food delivery rider?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe Jason only had a handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace&rsquo;s grandmother woke up. Hence, Grace rushed to her grandmother&rsquo;s room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt helped Grandma sit up on the bed. Grace&rsquo;s grandmother smiled as soon as she caught sight of her. "You're here. Come, come closer. Let me take a good look at my little Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes reddened. She got closer to the bed as she looked at the elderly in front of her. Grace tried to say something, but she had a sore nose and nothing came out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma raised her hand and touched Grace's head. "You look like you're going to cry. What's the matter? Did someone bully you?"</p></div>
