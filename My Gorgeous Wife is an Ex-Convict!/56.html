        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So, you were holding onto Chase while getting it on with another man!" Farah's voice suddenly sounded out.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt a headache coming on. The world seemed never to lack people like Farah Steele. Grace would&rsquo;ve said something snarky to that effect, and that maybe Farrah should spend some time in jail&mdash;it was filled with nasty people just like her. But she didn&rsquo;t bother engaging.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason turned around and looked coldly at the woman behind them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was a flash of surprise in Farah's eyes when she saw Jason. This man was even more handsome than the male leads in the TV series. His hair was a mess. Too long and unkempt, but if the bangs were cut shorter and if he were to wear some decent clothes, he could definitely push the male stars out of their spots on the ranking TV series.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Farah was immediately jealous. Why does Grace deserve all of this? Not only is she liked by Chase, but she also has such a handsome man accompanying her! It was bullshit.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She raised the corners of her mouth and flashed a vicious smile. "Are you Grace's friend? You probably don't know that she has been in prison. Back then, she hit someone while drunk driving. It was the same as murder!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, to her disappointment, the man's face did not show a look of surprise, disbelief, or indeed any sign of caring about what she had said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instead, he still looked calm.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And that cold, calm had her taking a step back.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His gaze on her grew even colder after hearing what she said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Looks like you were the person who was spreading rumors about this matter," Jason said quietly as if Farrah had just confirmed what he&rsquo;d suspected.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fear rose in Farah's heart. She felt that if she admitted to it then and there, she would end up suffering serious consequences. But why should she bear the brunt of anything?! She wasn&rsquo;t a murderer, Grace was!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She bit her lip and then said, "So what if I was? I did this for everyone's sake. We all have the right to know if the people around us have committed a crime. If she is afraid that others will find out about it, then she shouldn't have done it in the first place!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason let out a soft laugh. "It's good that you admitted to it."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After that, he no longer paid attention to Farah. He turned to Grace and said, "Sister, let's go. I don't want to bother with this woman anymore."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay." Grace ignored her as if Farrah was trash to be swept off the street.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The couple turned and walked away.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Farah stared at the two people's retreating backs. "Sister?" Was this man Grace's younger brother? But they didn't look alike. Not only that, Grace and the man seemed to be about the same age!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man flashed one icy glare over his shoulder.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Farrah felt that look all the way to her bones.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was still holding onto Jason, but she did not start walking home. Instead, she pulled him in another direction.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I got my paycheck today. Let's go shopping and have a good meal," she said. "Speaking of which, Jay, we haven't had a good meal out since we met."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then let's go and have a good meal," Jason said. "But I'll treat you. After all, I've been earning money too, and you've been taking care of me all this while."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">For some reason, Grace felt as if her own child had grown up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then let's have you treat me," Grace smiled and said. She didn&rsquo;t linger on her encounter with Chase or on the mean things that Farrah said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason was with her, and he accepted her for who she was.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two of them walked to a mall in the center of the city. In the mall, Grace picked a popular restaurant for them to eat at.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The dishes in this restaurant are not bad, and their prices are affordable. I used to eat here with my colleagues before..." She paused halfway through her sentence.</p></div>
