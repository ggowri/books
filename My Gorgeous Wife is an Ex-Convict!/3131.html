        <h1>Chapter 3129</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber was in the apartment, checking the time. It was almost time for George to bring Simon back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, the doorbell rang shortly after, but when she opened the door, she saw George carrying Simon on his shoulder, fast asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The child played too much today and fell asleep," George said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber pursed her lips, wanting to wake her son up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't wake him up. Let him sleep a little longer. Where is his room? I'll put him in bed and let him continue sleeping," George said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber hesitated. She really didn't want George to step into her living space, but looking at Simon's sleeping face, she finally said, "Follow me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George carried Simon on his back and entered the apartment, arriving at the room that Amber had prepared for her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room is not very big, at least much smaller than Simon's room in the Gregory family's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, despite being small, it is very cozy and you can tell that Amber has put a lot of effort into decorating it with care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George carefully placed his son on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">SimonGrace is still fast asleep and hasn't woken up yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber approached and took off the child's shoes, then covered her son with a small blanket. She then turned to George and said, "Okay, Mr. Gregory, you have returned the child, you can leave now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cold tone and the distant expression made George's heart sting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Amber, no matter what, I am still Simon's father. Do you have to be so cold towards me?" George said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of attitude should I have towards you then, Mr. Gregory?" Amber asked in response, her cold gaze making George feel even more pained in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I just hope that our relationship can improve a bit, so it will be better for the children," he said with a slightly hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under her gaze, he felt a sense of embarrassment at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's as if she could see right through his thoughts and intentions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it really just for the sake of the child? He knows deep down that it's not just about the child. He just doesn't want her to be so cold towards him and wants to be close to her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought that our current relationship was the result of me trying to ease things," said Amber coldly. "George, if it weren't for Simon, I wouldn't even want to look at you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every time she sees him, it only makes her feel more foolish and silly about her past actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why choose to love George, a man full of suspicion and jealousy, who even though claims to love her, abandoned her when she needed him the most, instead of loving a good man like Herman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do I make you hate me like this?" George approached Amber and said, "I know I made a lot of mistakes before, but I've been trying my best to make up for them. Amber, for the sake of our child, won't you give me a chance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really think it's worth saying something like that now?" Amber dodged and said, "Simon is still sleeping, and I don't want to argue with you here and wake up the child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she finished speaking, she walked straight out of Simon's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George followed Amber outside, but when Amber reached the apartment door and was about to open it to let George leave, he suddenly grabbed her hand that was about to open the door.</p></div>
