        <h1>Chapter 2872</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was already out of breath even though it was just a short distance from the living room to the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After helping Brian to the bed in the bedroom, Valda Theller looked at Brian's clothes while feeling troubled. Finally, she decided to help him take off the outer coat. She gave up the idea of helping him take off his shirt and pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was lying on the bed with his eyes closed as if he had fallen asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller leaned over and started unbuttoning his coat with her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to undo the last button, his eyes popped open, and his hand caught hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ouch!" Valda Theller shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He squeezed it so hard it was as if he was going to crush her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt?" he murmured and released his grip. However, he drew her hand to his lips instead of releasing Valda Theller's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her thin lips pressed the back of her hand as he peppered it with kisses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, don't leave me, okay?" His husky voice rang in the silent room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller instantly felt a clench in her heart as mixed feelings spread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not that she wanted to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She left because she did not want to be someone he hated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what, Brian? I regret knowing you so late," Valda Theller murmured as she lifted his other hand and caressed his face. "How great would it be if I was the one who saved you on the hills? That way, you wouldn&rsquo;t have unrequited feelings for Grace and experience such a difficult love. You and I wouldn't be in this situation today either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only said it because he was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? Are you... Are you leaving me too? You said... we're dating on the premise of marriage... So let's get married. Let's get married now... Would that make you want to stay with me?" he stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're not getting married," said Valda Theller. It was because he had never loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, we'll get married. We'll get married..." He suddenly rolled over and pinned her under him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, what are you doing?" shouted Valda Theller. Her female instinct seemed to tell her what would happen next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, no!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller tried to push Brian away, but his hands pressed hard against her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda... Let's... get married..." His lips fell on hers when he finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The drunken kiss was so intense that it seemed to burn her soul...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had a night of passion!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller did not expect to sleep with Brian after she broke up with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She left his mansion in a hurry afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in her apartment, she entered the bathroom and saw the marks he had left on her skin.</p></div>
