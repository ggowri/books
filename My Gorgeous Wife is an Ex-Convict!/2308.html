        <h1>Chapter 2306</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to help Kyla find her friend?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yeah, Kyla is my friend, and I want to help her, of course. I don't want to see Jacqueline Bowman threaten Kyla. She nearly killed the baby Kyla is carrying and almost got Kyla raped. Such a person shouldn't be placed on probation and released!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We don't have to go through so much trouble if we want to find out where Kyla's friend is. We just need to make Jacqueline Bowman talk," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blinked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make her suffer a little and she'll talk. People like Jacqueline Bowman probably can't handle much suffering," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace instantly got it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The suffering Jason mentioned was not simple suffering but torture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jacqueline Bowman is currently in the detention center!" reminded Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what? I can get someone to do it if you want," he said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... it's against the law," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gazed at her, understanding her respect for the law. Otherwise, she would not have chosen to become a lawyer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After being with her, he had also put away his dark ways and changed his principles of doing things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I'm willing to do anything you want. If you want me to be a law-abiding person, I'm willing to comply, but if I have to use all means to fulfill your requests, then... I can break the law for you too. To me, you are my law," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A law he was willing to comply with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes suddenly warmed up. She felt like tears were about to pour out of her eyes. "Jay, my biggest wish is for you to be okay! If what I want requires you to do something you shouldn't do, I'd rather not want it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she took his hands gently, "I don't want you to get too much blood on your hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lashes quivered as he looked down at the hands she was holding. "But I'm willing to protect you and the children regardless of how much blood there&rsquo;ll be on my hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She choked emotionally for a while before drawing his hands to her lips and kissing them gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The silly man loved her with all his life! All she could do in return was to love him and protect him with all she had...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I love you!" Grace looked up, stood on her tiptoes, and kissed Jason on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He trembled slightly and gently returned her kiss...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace, do you know how glad I am that you love me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace, do you know that as long as I can have you, I&rsquo;ll be full of joy even if I go to hell?'</p></div>
