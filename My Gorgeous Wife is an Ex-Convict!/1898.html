        <h1>Chapter 1896</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason suddenly opened his eyes and pinned Grace on the bed, "If you love me so much, why did you rather fall into the sea than forgive me? Yes, I did coldly look on when your case took place back then. I've regretted it countless times. When you found out about the truth, I begged you to forgive me countless times but you still chose to die and leave me! If it weren&rsquo;t for the kids, would you have come back to me? Grace, do you really love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His dark peach blossom eyes glared at her as he uttered the words he had been repressing in his heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What made him feel most betrayed was not that she had helped that woman but that... she might not love him at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All her love for him was probably just because she wanted to give the kids a complete family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze, a little confused for a moment. 'What... What is he talking about? I chose to fall into the sea rather than forgive him? What's going on here? I chose to fall into the sea with the three children in my belly because I didn't want him to die saving me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay... Um, is there some mistake? It's not like what you said at all. Who told you I fell into the sea because I didn't want to forgive you?" Grace stopped him and asked when he was about to get up and leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't need anyone to tell me about it. I experienced it myself. Shouldn't I know?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But you lost your memory!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I recovered my memory when Joseph hypnotized me. Grace, I remember what happened! So stop saying you love me. You don't love me at all! That's why it was so easy for you to help that woman!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Jason got up and shook Grace's hand away. He threw a shirt over himself and hurried out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at the empty room, a little dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What does he mean he remembers? The problem is that the truth isn't as what he said at all! What the hell is going on here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What the hell is going on with his memory?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's head was full of confusion!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason did not forgive Grace, and she did not even know where to find him in the old mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, the mansion was large and had many cloisters. It was easy to get lost, especially for someone who was not familiar with the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Grace did not leave. She finally found Terrence in the mansion after a long search. "Do you know that Jay has recovered his memory?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" Terrence was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "But his memory seems a little off. He said he remembers that I fell into the sea to escape from him. It's because I wouldn't forgive him, so I chose to fall into the sea to leave him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence froze. "How did that happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He said he recovered his memory after Dr. Joseph hypnotized him. Are you sure there&rsquo;s nothing wrong... with Dr. Joseph?" said Grace. The first reaction she had was whether Dr. Joseph had tampered with anything when he hypnotized Jason.</p></div>
