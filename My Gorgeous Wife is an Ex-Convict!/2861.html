        <h1>Chapter 2859</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne said righteously. Wynne even tried to push Camille Strickland away at the end of his speech.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland tried hard to stop him. Valda Theller was afraid that her best friend would get hurt, so she rushed to help her. As soon as she came forward, Wynne slapped Valda Theller in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a loud slap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne slapped so hard that Valda Theller felt her ears buzzing and her cheek burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland immediately scolded Wynne, "How could you slap her? You've gone too far!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne said confidently, "She's heartless. Of course, I can slap her! I&rsquo;ll still slap her even if you call the police. Don't you guys agree? Don't people like her deserve to be slapped?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several voices in the crowd said, "Yeah!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Heartless ingrates deserve to be slapped!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How dare she works as a comic artist? The works of people like her should be banned."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was uncertain who started it, but someone began throwing things at Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland protected her best friend and asked other staff to look for the venue's security guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though Camille Strickland protected Valda Theller, someone still rushed to Valda Theller and threw drinks, cakes, and other random things at her. Valda Theller soon looked like a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to hide, but the insults from all sides and the things thrown at her made her feel like she was back in university when she was being insulted and treated in the same way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, don't just stand here. I'll take you somewhere to hide first," said Camille Strickland, trying to take her best friend to hide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller's body was very stiff. She heard her best friend's voice and wanted to walk away to follow her best friend and avoid everything here, but she could not walk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hair and clothes were wet with various drinks. Someone had even picked up comics to throw at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It hurt when they hit her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The insults kept stimulating her nerves, making her feel like she was suffocating. Even breathing became difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'S-Somebody help me... Help!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The name crossed her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She struggled to open her eyes to look for Brian&hellip; in the huge crowd. If Brian were here, he would definitely rescue her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would save her from this mess just like what had happened on the set last time. When she thought she was about to get humiliated, his subordinates showed up and rescued her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian... Brian...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kept shouting the name in her head. Suddenly, she froze. She saw the familiar figure in the crowd.</p></div>
