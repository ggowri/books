        <h1>Chapter 2124</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He loved her. However, this lifetime was not enough. He hoped there was a next life. In the next life, he would love her more, take care of her carefully, and not let her suffer any harm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">... </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace came to Kyla's store the next day and found that Lina was also there. However, Lina only came to chat with Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, Lina only stayed at home and took good care of the baby in her belly these days. She had stopped working. All she did was eat and sleep or watch TV shows. She was extremely bored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina smiled when she saw that Grace was here. "What a coincidence. We three are all here. If we have one more person, we can play mahjong. But if our kids get together, we can have more than one mahjong table. When they find their other halves, we can have three tables."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was amused by what Lina said. "Why do you keep thinking about mahjong? What's the matter? Do you want to play mahjong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"A little. Let's play mahjong after I deliver my baby!" said Lina. Then, she looked at Kyla's belly. "Kyla, where do you plan to register your baby's obstetric record? Do you want to go to the hospital I'm going to? I have a good doctor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks. I... A specialist from Municipal Women's Hospital is overseeing my pregnancy," said Kyla after hesitating a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina did not overthink it, but Grace said, "Kyla, Martin Weiss came to look for me yesterday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla paused and looked at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss asked me to persuade you to give up the baby. He said that it's too risky for you to have this baby as it&rsquo;ll affect your own safety. I want to hear from you whether he's telling the truth," asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said with shock, "What? It's dangerous for Kyla to have the baby? What's going on here? Is it because she's pregnant at an older age? But aren&rsquo;t there a lot of people who gave birth in their 40s?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at her two friends who were concerned about her and said honestly, "It's not because I'm older. It's because I&rsquo;ve undergone a liver transplant. The doctor said my liver function might get affected during the third trimester, and my body might not be able to take it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was worried when she heard that. "Then... Then are you still going to keep the baby, Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Well, I'm not giving up for now. I'll make up my mind after the consultation with the specialist from Municipal Women's Hospital. But I&rsquo;ll fight for the baby unless it's necessary that I give them up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she spoke, Kyla looked at Grace. "Grace, didn't you risk your life for your three children too? You know it doesn't matter who persuades me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace naturally understood Kyla's current state the best, so she said, "But promise me, if the doctor says the chance of delivering your child safe is too slim during the consultation, then you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then I'll see what I can do," interrupted Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Lina, who had been sitting on the chair, suddenly frowned. She covered her belly with one hand as she looked at the two with panic on her face. She said, "Um... I think my water broke!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her water broke without warning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla and Grace had given birth before and knew what it meant when one&rsquo;s water broke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Grace quickly said, "Get in my car. I'll take you to the hospital. Don't panic. Lie flat after you get into the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina replied and tried to take a deep breath. Grace and Kyla quickly helped Lina into the passenger seat and then reclined it.</p></div>
