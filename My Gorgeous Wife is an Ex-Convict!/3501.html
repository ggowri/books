        <h1>Chapter 3499</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat by the bed, gazing at her. "Veronica, they say that when people are in the most danger, they think of the ones they care about the most. Who do you think of when you're in danger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Veronica was taken aback and almost choked on her saliva.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was in the most danger, who did she think of... She looked at the beautiful face in front of her. The words that she could have said openly and honestly suddenly became difficult to utter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was wrong with her? Even if she said she thought of him, wouldn't that mean he was the one she cared about the most? What was the problem?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know why, but when faced with his gaze, her heart began to beat unusually fast, as if something she didn't want to change was slowly changing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I thought of my mother!" Veronica's lips were dry as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your mother?" Mason was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I thought of my mother because when I was in danger as a child, she...she protected me." She spoke, but only she knew that she was lying!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for why she told this lie, at this moment, she didn't even understand it herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A hint of disappointment flickered in his eyes, but he didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica quickly closed her eyes, not wanting to look at Mason's face anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason looked at the person lying on the bed for a long time before he raised his hand and gently stroked her bangs. "Veronica, why wasn't I the one you thought of back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person on the bed remained still, as if sleeping, with her eyes closed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, he withdrew his hand and sat quietly by her bed, letting time pass by...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica woke up the next day, she saw that Mason was no longer in the room and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Last night, she didn't actually fall asleep when she closed her eyes. She also heard what he said, but didn't know how to respond, so she continued to pretend to be asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's feelings towards her...could it be...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the thought of that possibility, she instinctively resisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To her, he had always been a younger brother, a family member. Even though there was no blood relation between them, this concept was deeply ingrained in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she couldn't even imagine what would happen if she changed her relationship with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, in her opinion, his feelings for her were just a childish obsession because she was the person he had spent the most time with since childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, when he meets more people and truly grows up, his feelings will also change, won't they?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like a child who is extremely attached to their favorite toy and refuses to lend it to other children, but when they grow up, they will realize that it was just a toy.</p></div>
