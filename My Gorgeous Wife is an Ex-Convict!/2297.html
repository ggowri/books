        <h1>Chapter 2295</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you... blame me?" she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "What's there to blame? I know you want your son to be safe, and I want the same thing. Aunt, goodbye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like what Mrs. Weiss said, Martin Weiss loved her so much that he ignored his health to get his blood drawn and stored in preparation for the very minor possibility of her needing blood during labor. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What about everything else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had recovered five years after the liver transplant, but no one knew what would happen to her liver during her pregnancy or even how long she had to live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was merely spending her life with her battered body, and there was no telling how long she would last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, they might as well end the relationship once and for all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked out of the hospital, only to find herself in tears when she reached the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out she would be so overcome with sadness after ending things with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps her affection for him was not as faint as she thought! It must have deepened during their time together these days...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback when she saw Kyla at her law firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had told Kyla the address of her firm, this was Kyla's first visit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, what's... come over you? What happened?" Grace asked quickly. Kyla's eyes were red and there were traces of wet tears on her face. She seemed to be in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes finally focused. "Grace, can you... find me a quiet room where I can stay for a while?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately said, "Okay, go to my office, then. No one will disturb you there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Grace took Kyla to her office and poured her a glass of warm water. "Kyla, is something wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla held the glass of warm water as she gazed down at it. After a long time, she sobbed. "I ended things with Martin Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze in confusion. "But weren't you thinking about getting together with Martin Weiss a while ago? Did he do something&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla interrupted, "No, he didn&rsquo;t do anything. I don't want to be with him. I've been thinking about it. My feelings for him aren't that deep. Perhaps my idea earlier was just... a momentary impulse. Besides, I don't know how long can my body last."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I know you mind your health, but no one knows what will happen in the future, right? As the saying goes, we don't know which comes first, tomorrow or an accident. Isn't grasping the present the most important thing?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I understand, but... I can't afford Martin Weiss's feelings toward me. Grace... In my opinion, it would be best for us if he and I separate, but... But I still..." Kyla sobbed uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had made the decision, but she was so upset about it. She was so upset that she had already shed many tears on her way here, but she now felt the urge to cry again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, that's because you... love Martin Weiss. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re upset after deciding to separate from him." Grace pointed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent.</p></div>
