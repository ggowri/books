        <h1>Chapter 3140</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She chuckled, realizing only now that he seemed to be thinking even more than she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I understand. I will never regret divorcing you and I won't give up on you!" she said. Finally, she added, "Never, for all eternity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was taken aback. The look on his face, which had been somewhat nervous and worried, suddenly turned into shock, and then into a gentle expression like water. "For eternity, are you really willing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why won't you?" She looked at him and said, "Brian, do you know how much I like you and love you? While you are afraid, I am also anxious. Before, I was afraid that you wouldn't like me. Later, I was afraid that the person you love the most is still Grace. And now, I am also afraid that in the future, there will be conflicts between us, or that your love for me will eventually be worn down by reality. I am afraid that I won't be able to fit into your world..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She murmured, "Brian, you're not the only one who's afraid. I am too. But even so, I still want to be with you and work hard to be able to stay with you. So when you ask me not to give up on you, I also hope that you won't give up on me. No matter what happens in the future, please don't easily give up on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian lowered his head and gently kissed her lips, saying "Never in a million years!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bending down, he carried her into the bedroom. "Valda, I love you. You are the one I love the most in this world!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes turned red, but her lips revealed a brilliant smile. This was her man, the man she would love for the rest of her life. "In this world, I love you the most!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spoke and then wrapped her arms around his neck, taking the initiative to kiss him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One night, it is so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Valda woke up the next day and saw Brian lying next to her, she felt a deep sense of happiness in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man she loved the most was lying right beside her, and as soon as she opened her eyes, the first person she saw was him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda couldn't help but sigh again as she looked at the handsome face in front of her. He was indeed very attractive, no wonder so many women were pursuing him relentlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Apart from his identity as a prince in the entertainment industry, his face should also play a big role.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His skin care is excellent, and his bone structure and skin texture are almost perfect. When viewed from the side, his nose bridge appears even more straight and his long black eyelashes make her envious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she had his eyelashes, she probably wouldn't need mascara.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't help but reach out her hand and gently touched his eyelashes, then exclaimed again that her future husband is an "eyelash spirit".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, his eyelashes trembled slightly, and then his phoenix eyes slowly opened.</p></div>
