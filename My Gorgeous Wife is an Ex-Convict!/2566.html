        <h1>Chapter 2564</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked at the little one. He looked pale, but he was in good spirits. His fingers were flexible as he built the toy. She could tell he enjoyed building toys like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two of them came to the little one's bedside, he stopped and looked at them. Of course, the little one's eyes were mainly focused on Amber Mitchell's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The eyes similar to George Gregory's narrowed slightly as if they were sizing up Amber Mitchell or were thinking of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one suddenly said, "I know you! You're Mommy's mentally ill sister!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A weird atmosphere filled the air as soon as he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory immediately said, "Who told you she's mentally ill? She's not! When you were in a coma, she was the one who saved you by donating her blood. She's donating her blood to you again for your full-body transfusion treatment the day after tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want her blood. Mommy said she's not a good person. She's a bad person. She harmed Grandpa, Grandma, and Mommy! Where's Mommy? Why hasn't Mommy come to see me?" Simon exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Louise Mitchell was not close to Simon, it was children's nature to want to be close to their mothers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's thin lips were almost pressed into a line. "Don't mention your... mommy again! And this woman before you has never harmed anyone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to talk about Mommy. I don't want this woman to save me. I want Mommy to save me! Where's Mommy? I want to see Mommy!" Simon tried to get down from the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His son's mentions of &lsquo;Mommy&rsquo; only made George Gregory more awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It reminded him of how stupid he was to believe Louise Mitchell and not compare her DNA with the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had done that one extra step, Louise Mitchell would not have been able to deceive him for so many years. He and Amber Mitchell might not have ended up like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. Stop asking for that woman. She can't save you at all!" George Gregory scolded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little one threw a tantrum and shouted even louder, "Mommy, Mommy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory raised his hand and was about to hit his son, but Amber Mitchell grabbed his hand. "There's nothing wrong with a child wanting to see his mother. If anything, it&rsquo;s the adults who are in the wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she leaned closer to the little one while half bending down. Her eyes were almost level with the little boys&rsquo; in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was her son with her genes and the same blood type. The boy's appearance was a mix of hers and George Gregory's. The outline of his face, eyebrows, and lips were similar to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Louise Mitchell's blood can't save you, so you need my blood to save you," Amber Mitchell said with a calmness in her gentle voice. "You can only do whatever you want and see whoever you want after you recover. Otherwise, you can only lay in the hospital bed all day doing nothing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon stared at Amber Mitchell and suddenly asked, "Are you trying to steal Daddy by saving me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one must have heard rumors even in the hospital, so he reacted strongly against Amber Mitchell from the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's expression froze instantly, and he looked at Amber Mitchell nervously.</p></div>
