        <h1>Chapter 2690</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can't withdraw mine because they&rsquo;re too deep..." he muttered as his long lashes lowered gently, half-obscuring those deep phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is he thinking? Is he thinking about the one he loves deeply?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Raymond Bowman said Brian refused to have any girlfriends for the one he loved. He even risked his life to save her and... is willing to never marry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How much does he love that woman? We&rsquo;re even dating because of... that woman!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" His voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller realized she had fallen into a trance from looking at him. Those phoenix eyes had looked up to meet hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"N-Nothing. I think Raymond Bowman probably won't bother me anymore after what you said in front of him." She paused. As if recalling something, she hurriedly said, "I... I know what you said isn't true. You don't love me. Don't worry&hellip; I... I won't misunderstand you. I won't bother you even if we break up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She anxiously tried to explain, but she spoke so quickly that she let out a low cry of pain when she accidentally tugged at her swollen face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you didn't misunderstand me." He put his fingertips to her lips and muffled all her voice. "You need to get some rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt as if her lips were on fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lay down on the bed in a fluster, and the heat from her lips seemed to spread to her face, which was probably very red now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... on earth is wrong with me? Why is my face turning so hot because of Brian's finger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because of... Brian's face? He's so good-looking! Um... It should be normal to blush... when a good-looking man presses his fingers against my lips.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller comforted herself. Then, she closed her eyes so she would stop looking at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the sound of even breathing came from the person on the hospital bed. It was obvious that she was asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was surprised that Valda Theller fell asleep so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How... unwary," murmured Brian. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she trust me?' He looked at the bruises on her face and felt that the injury on the woman's face was so harsh to the eyes for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? No Stephensonl?" In the detention center's meeting room, Queenie Mack looked at the lawyer her family had hired for her and could hardly believe the reply she heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, because those extras insist that you instructed them to hurt Valda Theller, Miss Mack. Besides that, they have records of the money you transferred to them. It's safe to say that they have all the evidence required, so you&rsquo;ll be detained for at least 15 days," the lawyer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"15 days?" Queenie Mack asked in shock. 'I don't even want to stay for a day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I&rsquo;m detained, it&rsquo;ll be the end of my career if word gets out. To make matters worse, if the heir of the Weiss family whom I&rsquo;m working so hard to approach finds out about this, how am I going to...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Queenie Mack hurriedly said, "No, I must get out immediately. It doesn't matter how much it costs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Mack, there's nothing we can do," the lawyer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How is there nothing we can do?" Queenie Mack panicked. "It should be fine if I can afford the Stephensonl. Besides, I swear not to leave tMason Swansonty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Mack, you&rsquo;ve offended the Hart family." The lawyer could only be more explicit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack froze. "What... do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Hart family told the police to handle everything by the book." In other words, if the police were lenient, they would be in trouble!</p></div>
