        <h1>Chapter 1617</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His mouth felt bitter. He wanted to say something else but did not know what to say after opening his mouth. Maybe there was nothing left to say between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter what he said, it would not be what she wanted to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss just watched Kyla turn around and step farther away from him until her figure disappeared into the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss stood alone with endless sorrow on his handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had been back in Emerald City for some time now. She had worked in a law firm with her mentor back when she was in L City. She was now in Emerald City and had to work as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two kids attended after-school classes during weekends, so Grace and Jason took advantage of their two-hour-long class to shop in the shopping mall nearby. They would see if there was any suitable office space nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want to start a law firm?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, I do have that in mind. I can start one if the rent is alright," said Grace. She had made some connections during her years in L City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she had to start many things from scratch in Emerald City, it should not be too difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you want to start one, I'll ask Terrence to find some suitable places for you later," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You'll probably find me somewhere big and expensive in a prime location."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wouldn't that be nice?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's not that it's bad. It's just too much of a waste. I just started in Emerald City, and I used to work with my mentor. Now that I'm going to go solo, it&rsquo;s still uncertain whether I can succeed! There's no need to invest so much so soon," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But I only want the best for you." He did not care if he lost money from investing in her. He just wanted to give her everything he could!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was afraid he had not given her enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know." Grace smiled. "Alright, let's shop around first. Lina told me that there's a cake shop around here with nice cakes. Let's go try them. If the cakes taste good, we'll bring home two slices for Mick and Jasper to try."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," replied Jason as he followed Grace to the cake shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The cake shop was probably the latest viral cake shop, so it was quite popular. It was almost full of fashionably dressed youngsters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as she walked into the cake shop, Grace could feel many people looking at her and Jason, especially young women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jay was good-looking and only 33 years old, which was the prime age for a man. He had lost some of his naivety and became more mature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He also had an indifferent aura, but his peach blossom eyes were unusually charming when he looked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His indifference and charm formed a unique temperament that many found attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help but rejoice that Jason rarely appeared before the media. Even when he did, the occasional photos and videos of him online would always be quickly deleted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, the chances of him being recognized when he was outside were rare.</p></div>
