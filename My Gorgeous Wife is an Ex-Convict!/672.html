        <h1>Chapter 671</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What were you talking about? Why did you suddenly..." Stella Lindsay asked in confusion, but what Brian said next struck fear into her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you know the name &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;, Grace?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's hair stood on end immediately as she looked at Grace in disbelief. 'Did she&hellip; Just call Brian &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Grace regain her memory?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did regain her memory, Stella Lindsay would immediately lose everything she had. That thought made Stella Lindsay feel as if she was going to lose her footing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were really called &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo; when you were little?" asked Grace as she frowned. 'So Brian is the boy in my dream?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was what happened in the dream real?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How in the world do you know that?" He was still clinging to the previous question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's me! I told Grace when I was little!" Stella Lindsay interjected suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was slightly stunned while Brian, after hearing this answer, stared somewhat blankly at Stella Lindsay. "You told her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. When I was little, I told Grace that I saved you. I even mentioned your name, so I guess Grace has some impression of it," said Stella Lindsay, reversing what happened between her and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes could not help but darken. There was a flash of self-mockery in his eyes. 'What was I thinking? I've already found the one who saved me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead, he lost his mind and sanity when Grace called him &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace!" Just then, Lina had already changed her clothes and came over. However, as soon as she came over, she saw the entertainment industry's crown prince who often appeared in gossip magazines. He was grabbing her best friend's arm while another woman was in the middle of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you..." Lina asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is Brian. You know him," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina nodded her head in a daze. She was a fan who followed many celebrities after all. Although she was not a die-hard fan, how could she not know the entertainment industry's crown prince?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is my cousin, Stella Lindsay." Grace continued introducing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina nodded her head again, but&hellip; Judging from the way things looked now, her best friend's cousin had something to do with Brian. She had her hand on Brian's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's&hellip; Going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could not wrap her head around this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian finally let go of her hand and muttered, "Don't call me 'Bryn' from now on. You have no right to call me that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he left the shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay no longer cared about her new bag and quickly left with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking shocked, Lina asked Grace, "What's going on? Your cousin&rsquo;s having an affair&hellip; Uh, with Brian? Also, why was Brian grabbing your arm? Do you have a problem with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace let out a long breath. "I'll tell you later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's last words kept replaying in her mind. 'I have no right to call him &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;?</p></div>
