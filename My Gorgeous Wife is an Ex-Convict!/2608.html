        <h1>Chapter 2606</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Mr. Weiss was divorcing the woman, so the servants were naturally contemptuous of Kyla. Some would even deliberately make things difficult for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla instantly asked no more questions after hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was aware of the servants' attitude toward her, and she knew she would not succeed in getting medicine from Shana Nicholls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla limped out of the mansion while holding her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the intersection, she hailed a taxi and went to the nearby drugstore. After buying the medicine, she was about to leave when a car stopped in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn, Old Madam wants to see you," somebody got out of the car and spoke respectfully to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart sank instantly. She already knew that she would meet Martin Weiss's mother again sooner or later when she came to L City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had promised Mrs. Weiss to separate from Martin Weiss, but she now came to L City voluntarily and refused to sign the divorce papers. How could Mrs. Weiss not know about this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla got into the car and arrived at the Weiss family's mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she limped after the servant into the Weiss family's living room, Mrs. Weiss looked at her walking posture and said indifferently, "Miss Corbyn, you're wounded."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I sprained my ankle, but it'll be alright in a few days," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss said indifferently, "Some injuries can heal in a few days, but some injuries aren't that simple. They can&rsquo;t be healed in a few days.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent for a moment before saying, "I'm sorry. I know Martin donated his liver a second time for me. I&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was his choice, and you have nothing to apologize for." 'Mrs. Weiss picked up the teacup in front of her, took a sip from it, and said, "I'm not going to blame you for this. After all, as a mother, I understand that you wanted to give birth to the baby in your belly. The child also carries the Weiss family's blood and is Martin's child. You risked your life for the baby, and he sacrificed his health to save you. It's hard to say who&rsquo;s right or wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss paused as she said that. Her eyes suddenly turned sharply to Kyla. "I just want to ask if you remember what you promised me, Miss Corbyn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened. It was still this question after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I meant it when I agreed to it, and I did try to keep my promise. It's just that... I didn't realize I'd end up dragging Martin down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why won't you get a divorce when you know you're dragging him down? As far as I know, Martin has asked the lawyer to talk to you about the divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla clenched her teeth. "It's because I love Martin. Back then, I was afraid that I loved him too little and would not have much time left to live when my liver failed after giving birth. That's why I wanted to separate from him. But now... I'd like to be with him if he's still willing to love me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You love him?" Mrs. Weiss suddenly rubbed her temples as if she had a headache. "You've never loved him after all these years, but you&rsquo;re suddenly saying that you love him. Miss Corbyn, what on earth are you thinking? You know Martin doesn't have feelings for you anymore, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know he doesn't have any feelings for me, but I want to fight for it anyway. Three months. I only need three months. I told him that I'll sign the divorce papers if he still insists on divorcing after three months. I won't waste any more time," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss put down the teacup in her hand. "Are you... are you really going to sign the papers after three months?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he doesn't love me after three months, I'll sign the papers without causing any more trouble. But if he's still willing to love me and have a family with me after three months, I hope you can accept a... mediocre daughter-in-law like me, Aunt."</p></div>
