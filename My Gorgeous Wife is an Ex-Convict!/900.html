        <h1>Chapter 899</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper hesitated and held Grace's hand back. "Why don't I go with you? What if..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It'll be alright." She smiled at him and patted the back of his hand. "I know him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper let go of her hand reluctantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got out of the car and followed the driver to the black Bentley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver opened the backseat door and Grace got in. Chase Harper could only vaguely see a man in a suit sitting in the back seat, but he could not see his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door closed and the Bentley sped off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sitting alone in the car, Chase Harper had many speculations in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who the hell... is that man in the back seat? What is his relationship with Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason who was sitting beside her. There was a playful smile on his face, but his eyes were cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you like that man named Chase Harper? Do you enjoy being with him that much?" he seemed to say nonchalantly, but in her ears, it was like a heavy hammer to her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's none of your business," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? Chase Harper runs a pretty small car dealership. A car dealership like this could cease to exist overnight," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stiffened immediately. 'Is he implying that he&rsquo;ll do something to Chase Harper's car dealership? Chase Harper started the car dealership. I don't want to cause Chase Harper any trouble because of me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly and said slowly, "I don't like him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" His dark eyes were fixed on her as if he was examining the truth of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I liked him, I would've dated him when I was working at the Sanitation Service Center," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes she wondered if she had fallen in love with a man like Chase Harper, then she would probably be happy with an ordinary but honest and sincere man like him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's best," said Jason before suddenly reaching out and grabbing Grace's right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned and saw that he had taken a piece of paper towel to wipe her hand gently. "You touched Chase Harper with this hand, didn't you? If you want what's best for him, don't touch him anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said it so gently as if it was just a kind reminder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace immediately felt goosebumps all over her body as a chill ran up her spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man like him could take Chase Harper down easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Emerald City, he could control others' life and death at will!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your hands are so cold," he muttered, rubbing her hands lightly against his like how he used to warm them in the winter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she felt nothing warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, don't... do anything to Chase Harper," she said dryly, her lips severely dry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you worried that I might harm Chase Harper?" he said with a chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you?" Her almond-shaped eyes looked straight at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on his lips faded a little. "Are you that worried about him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; just know what it feels like to have someone control your life and death," Grace said bitterly.</p></div>
