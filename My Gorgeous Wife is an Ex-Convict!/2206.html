        <h1>Chapter 2204</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The arm he was holding was trembling as if silently expressing her resistance and fear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss froze. It turned out things had unknowingly... gone this far.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, we're not the right one for each other. I just want to give birth to this baby in peace. Please let me live in peace and leave me alone!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly turned pale as his lips quivered. It seemed he wanted to speak, but he said nothing. He unconsciously let go of her arm. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla started walking away, while Martin Weiss looked blankly at the retreating figure. His heart ached, mocking his stupidity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked to the bus stop to wait for the bus, but a car soon stopped in front of her. A man got out and said to Kyla, "Hello, Miss Kyla. Mr. Weiss sent me. He asked me to take you to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks, I'll wait for the bus. It's convenient." Kyla refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man looked troubled. "But... Mr. Weiss asked me to send you to the hospital, saying that the bus might be too crowded and it would be bad for you and the baby. Please help me out. With my car parked here, it&rsquo;ll be inconvenient when the bus comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing a bus coming from far away, she knew there would be a jam if the car continued to be parked here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip and got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The chauffeur immediately drove to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">About 15 minutes later, the car stopped at the entrance of Municipal Women's Hospital. Kyla got off the car and walked into the hospital. She did not notice Martin Weiss standing not far away. He followed her into the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was at the front while he was behind. Separated by the hospital crowd, he just looked at her from afar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had registered for a consultation with a specialist in the hospital. However, a nurse took her to the VIP consultation room when she took the queue number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I registered for a regular specialist," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, Mrs. Weiss, your husband has already booked the VIP consultation for you. Since Dr. He was also the one you consulted last time, her team will be responsible for all the outpatient examinations and your delivery. Since you&rsquo;re having a high-risk pregnancy, you need a team of specialists to take charge of the whole process. Of course, you can let us know if you want another team," the nurse said politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip and finally said, "Forget it. I don't need another team of specialists. Dr. He is fine," she said, no longer refusing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, with her current condition, it would be better to have a team of specialists look after her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything went well this time. However, Kyla understood that the real &lsquo;battle&rsquo; would start when the baby was seventh months old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla walked out of the consultation room, she suddenly heard a voice. "Are you... Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze and looked up. A woman in her early 30s with elaborate makeup on and was dressed in designer clothes was looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The vaguely familiar appearance made Kyla frown. Then, a figure flashed across her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you... Jacqueline Bowman?" Kyla asked with uncertainty. After all, the person in front of her did not look quite like the person she had in mind. </p></div>
