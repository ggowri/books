        <h1>Chapter 1397</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't do anything wrong, so what&rsquo;s there for me to admit? You want someone who was framed to apologize to those who framed them. Martin Weiss, are you so confused that you can&rsquo;t distinguish wrong from right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whether you&rsquo;re willing or not, you're going to get down on your knees and grovel today! Kyla Corbyn, you'd better not force me to make you do it myself!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly chuckled. "Martin Weiss, so you're a fool, after all. You believe everything the Daniels family and Paisley Daniels say. Do you think Paisley Daniels was the one who saved your life? She hasn't done anything, and the blood running through you has nothing to do with her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said this, the expressions on the Daniels family members changed instantly. Paisley Daniels, who had been sitting on the hospital bed and leisurely eating, suddenly stiffened. She nearly tipped the bowl in her hand over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does Kyla Corbyn... know something? Does she know about the bone marrow donation?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin... What... What does she mean?" asked Paisley Daniels as she pretended to be puzzled. Her pale face and sick look made her seem a little frailer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stepped forward and comforted her, saying, "It's nothing. You don't have to mind her nonsense!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Daniels lunged forward, raised his hand, and slapped Kyla Corbyn twice. "What are you talking about? Do you still want to destroy Paisley and Martin's relationship? Women like you only deserve to kneel to Paisley!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Mr. Daniels ordered the two men restraining Kyla Corbyn, "Make her kneel!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men looked at Martin Weiss. After all, Martin Weiss was their boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss nodded slightly and tacitly agreed to Mr. Daniels's order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men instantly applied force and pressed Kyla Corbyn's body down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Kyla Corbyn tried her best to resist, she could not fight the force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thump!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her knees hit the tiled floor of the hospital ward so hard that the sound alone could make one feel the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her knees hurt, but her heart did not feel any pain&mdash;only humiliation and ridicule.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it had once hurt too much that she was now numb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've never harmed Paisley Daniels. If Paisley Daniels did miscarry this time, I'm afraid she wasn't carrying your child. That's why she deliberately staged the miscarriage," Kyla Corbyn said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, she could not figure out why Paisley Daniels would do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expressions of the Daniels family members changed again when she said this. Paisley Daniels suddenly felt fear surging in her heart. 'Kyla Corbyn has seen through... all my schemes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I can't let Martin believe Kyla Corbyn! Absolutely not!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn!" Paisley Daniels put on a grief-stricken look. "How can you throw mud at me like this? What have I done to you that you would slander me like this? Are you repeatedly harming me because you think Martin will protect you no matter what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's tears kept falling while Mr. Daniels and Mrs. Daniels continued to comfort their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Daniels said fiercely, "Martin, are you going to let this woman slander Paisley without any restraint? Paisley loves you so much. How could she have been pregnant with someone else's child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Paisley Daniels who was crying until she was almost out of breath. Her pitiful, pained, and depressed appearance made him feel as if there was a mountain pressing heavily on him.</p></div>
