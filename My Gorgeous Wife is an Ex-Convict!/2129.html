        <h1>Chapter 2127</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I went to the store to see you, but Mom said Lina's water broke, so you accompanied her to the hospital," said Martin Weiss. He was getting more used to calling her mother &lsquo;Mom&rsquo;. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla answered somewhat difficulty, "Lina's having a difficult labor, and she's still in there. Hadwin Stephenson's accompanying her, and many doctors have gone in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's face turned solemn when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The four said nothing and waited outside the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, as time went by, the air became more depressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sometime later, there was suddenly a piercing roar from the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The delivery rooms here were soundproof, but they could hear it when they were standing outside. They could imagine how loud it was inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The four of them froze, and Grace said nervously, "What happened? That scream... It seems to be Hadwin Stephenson's voice! Is it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is it Lina? Did something happen to Lina?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, a doctor rushed out in a hurry and said to Jason, "Young master Reed, the mother in there is dying. She has passed out, and the baby is stuck in the birth canal. We can't carry out a Caesarean section, so we can only opt for a natural birth. But judging from the current situation, I'm afraid it&rsquo;ll be difficult to save both the mother and baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace almost fainted when she heard this. Kyla, who was nearby, also paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How did this happen? Is there nothing we can do?" Grace asked urgently, finally understanding why Hadwin Stephenson let out such a piercing roar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was tantamount to losing his wife and baby overnight! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If there's a way, we would have done it already. We've done everything we can. We doctors aren't gods. There's nothing we can do!" the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace staggered and would have collapsed if Jason had not supported her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There must be another way. There must be!" Grace sobbed as tears streamed out of her eyes. "We said we would play mahjong together in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was sobbing too. They were together just a few hours ago, talking and laughing. However, a few hours later, this happened!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, a young voice rang out. "I can save her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Kyla looked toward the voice. It was the same little boy they had seen back then. The mysterious little boy who predicted that Lina was carrying a daughter had appeared outside the delivery room, saying he could save Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Can you really save Lina?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I can save her and her baby." Of course, the baby mattered more to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stared at the boy. "This isn't a game but concerns actual lives. Do you know that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy said calmly, "I know. But you'd better let me in soon, or there's no way I can save them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace took a deep breath, "Okay, I'll bring you inside!"</p></div>
