        <h1>Chapter 2193</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed wanted to say that they had made preparations, but Jasper tugged at his sleeve, hinting at him not to talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because their mother would only nag more if he said something. She would lecture them so much that there was no way for them to argue back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed obediently kept his mouth shut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a long lecture, Grace asked, "Do you know what you did wrong this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two of them nodded hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Will it happen again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two shook their heads in unison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was glad that her children were obedient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason glanced at his son and said, "Mick, since you like hacking into security systems so much, hack into the security system at home and find out if there are any more loopholes once we get back. If you can't find them, you can't touch the computer for a month."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed immediately looked as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had hacked into the security system at home many times since he was little. He had detected all the loopholes long ago. How could he find more?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In other words, he could not touch the computer for a month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the ultimate punishment for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper looked at her brother sympathetically. However, she could not do anything to help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"As for Jasper..." Jason's eyes fell on his daughter. "You&rsquo;ve already cried so badly today. If you do a thing like that again, I&rsquo;ll have you write a self-reflection report, got it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper blinked and quickly nodded her little head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was dumbstruck. "That's it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What else?" asked Jason as he looked at his daughter's almond-shaped eyes that were swollen from crying. He only wished his eyes were the ones swollen instead of his daughter's. "Alright, I'll tell you a story before you sleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What about Brother?" asked Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your brother doesn't like bedtime stories. He'll fall asleep on his own," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at her husband's double standards and was suddenly between laughter and tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed's face scrunched up. 'Though... I don't like Daddy telling me bedtime stories very much, why wasn&rsquo;t his punishment for me a self-reflection report? I'd rather write a self-reflection report for an entire month than go a month without touching the computer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day on the plane, both brother and sister looked unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed was upset when he thought about not being able to touch the computer for a month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Like a chatter bug, Jasper kept asking Grace when she could come to Deer City to see William again and whether she could stay for a few more days next time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure, I can bring you to Deer City for a few days during the school holidays so you can meet William. Besides, you can video call William every day. Didn't he promise to be your best friend forever?" said Grace.</p></div>
