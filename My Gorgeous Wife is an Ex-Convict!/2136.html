        <h1>Chapter 2134</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The Reed family, the Stephenson family, and the Weiss family all spent the next few days looking for the little boy. They started from the hospital's surveillance footage to track down the boy&rsquo;s movements. They almost turned the entire Emerald City upside down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the boy's final whereabouts could not be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy also had ways to counter being tracked. After leaving the hospital, he deliberately avoided some of the surveillance cameras.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Listening to the news reported by Jason's staff, Grace was secretly worried but also blamed herself. "If I had known, I would have held the child's hand and not let go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then it would not be so difficult to find him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew how special that little boy was, yet she did not even know when he left the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason consoled her. "Don't blame yourself. You were focused on Lina and her baby. Besides, we'll find the boy as long as he hasn&rsquo;t left Emerald City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I'm afraid the longer we wait, the harder it's gonna be for Lina to wake up!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy's existence had been Hadwin Stephenson's hope, but after the past few days, she could feel Hadwin Stephenson getting enveloped in despair again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But from your description of that child, he seems particularly concerned about Lina's baby," Jason said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, when Lina's baby was kicking intensely, the child suddenly appeared. He only put his hand on Lina's belly and the baby calmed down. During the delivery, the baby would have suffocated if the child hadn't sucked the remaining secretion out of her," said Grace. Suddenly she seemed to think of something. "Yes&hellip; Since the child cares about the baby so much, maybe we could try luring the child out with the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If they could not find him, they could lure him out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes narrowed slightly, and he said with a smile, "We can try."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After that, the newspapers published news saying that Stephenson Group's Hadwin Stephenson's newborn daughter was in critical condition and was currently undergoing rescue. The news went viral online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After the news was published, one tall and one short figure appeared in the intensive care unit of the neonatal department late at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You really came." Grace looked at the little boy in front of her. He was followed by the middle-aged man she had met before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy looked at the people before him. His beautiful eyes blinked as if he just realized it. "So you're the ones who published the news. Were you trying to lure me out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes. We couldn't find you, so this was the only way we could try to get you to come,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So the baby isn't in critical condition?" the little boy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace replied, "The baby is doing well so far. We lured you out in hopes that you can save the baby's mother. She has been in a coma since she left the delivery room and has not woken up. You were able to wake her up in the delivery room for her to give birth to the baby. Is there any way you can wake her up now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace spoke earnestly. Almost all hope was now on this mysterious little boy. "As long as you can save Lina, we&rsquo;ll try to agree to anything you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the little boy only uttered two words coldly, "I refuse." He seemed to not care about Lina's life or death at all.</p></div>
