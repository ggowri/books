        <h1>Chapter 3400</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I'll just wash it off when I get back," said Lornell, as she slowly clenched her small hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It feels like he's still holding her little hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Summer vacation... it should come soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once summer vacation arrives, he can meet her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Somehow, he feels like Tina's reluctance to part has turned into his own!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Grace learned from her husband that their little daughter had already made an agreement with Harley to help her find a fianc&eacute; in the future, she couldn't help but sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Jasmine doesn't want you to help her find one?" Grace asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, she said she trusts Harley." Jason was also helpless about this. His daughter's trust in him was less than that of a three-year-old child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasmine and Harley have always had a good relationship." Grace said. Initially, Jasmine went to the Zhong family because of Valda's rescue, and she was the most hardworking of the four children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Harley was born, Jasmine went to the Hart family more often. In addition, the age difference between Jasmine and the triplets was ultimately too big, so they couldn't play together. Jasmine was closer in age to Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, in terms of emotions, Grace actually feels that Jasmine and Harley's relationship is better than Jasmine's relationship with the triplets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, for families like the Quentin family in the Crypt, is Harley really suitable?" Grace expressed her concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Quentin family has a good reputation among the Crypt families, and their family roots are in medicine. Not many people dare to provoke them. After all, even those with high status and power cannot guarantee that they will not need the Quentin family's help one day. Therefore, they naturally do not dare to easily provoke the Quentin family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, that's not too bad. But children have their own fate. Maybe Harley and Lornell will have a great future together, just like how I never expected Jasper and William to have such a good relationship," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was talking about her eldest daughter, she suddenly seemed to remember something and her eyes dimmed for a moment. "By the way, is there still no news about Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No news," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace pursed her lips. It had been three years, and there was still no news of Lawrence. His disappearance had become a source of pain for the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Jasper has been mentioning Lawrence less and less over the past two years, as if gradually forgetting about him, Grace knows that's not the case. Every year on the day when the Abbott family had their accident, Jasper becomes particularly quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Abbott family bought the house they used to rent, at her request. Everything inside is maintained to look exactly like it did back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper even brought back some sheet music that Lawrence had left in the room and placed it in her own room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And as for those music scores, she doesn't allow anyone to touch them, not even if someone wants to help clean and organize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace knows that her daughter is not gradually forgetting Lawrence, but burying him even deeper in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That emotion was suppressed by Jasper in their heart, and it's uncertain when it will erupt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps only if Lawrence is found alive one day, can this suppressed emotion be released.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... will there be such a day?</p></div>
