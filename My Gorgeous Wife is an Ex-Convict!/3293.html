        <h1>Chapter 3291</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the movie ended, the group met the creators of the film up close, including Kering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kering greeted Brian and Valda with a smile, "Mr. Hart, Mrs. Hart, hello. I didn't expect you to really come."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled and then introduced her group of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace, Kyla, and Amber were okay and not overly enthusiastic, but Lina was different. Her eyes were shining with an incredible passion, as if she was meeting her idol as a fan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, Kering is now one of Lina's idols, although... um, she actually has quite a few idols.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Hadwin saw his wife's reaction, he felt frustrated because he knew that she had probably forgotten all the promises she made to him earlier upon seeing Kering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a dedicated fan, Lina brought Kering's photo album and posters for him to sign. She expressed her intention to keep them safe, which surprised Kering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when Lina expressed her desire to take a group photo and give a hug, Hadwin finally pulled his wife aside and said to everyone, "Sorry, Lina and I have something to attend to, we'll be leaving now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And everyone was used to this already, after all, only Lina could make Hadwin jealous like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They've seen this kind of trick before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, I'm fine," Lina struggled to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have something to say," said Hadwin with certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That...at least let me take a photo with Kering first, I haven't taken one yet...Hadwin..." Her voice trailed off, indicating that Lina's wish to take a photo was temporarily unfulfilled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone recognized each other and smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian bent down and whispered in Valda's ear, "It's a good thing you didn't try to hug Kering, otherwise I might have taken you away too. Valda, the only man you can hold onto is me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face blushed slightly again. His words seemed to imply something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right at that moment, Grace's phone rang. But after answering the call, her expression suddenly changed. "Okay, I understand. I'll be back soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was confused. Kyla asked, "Grace, what's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's the kid who learned to play the piano with Jasper. His mother has some issues, so I need to go back and take care of it first," Grace said, and then hurriedly left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it the boy named Lawrence?" Valda asked. Sometimes when Valda talked with Grace, Grace would mention that boy.</p></div>
