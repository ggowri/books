        <h1>Chapter 3475</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, as Jasper listened to Mason's response, he suddenly understood that Mason's absence from school these days might be related to Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe Veronica would like to meet you too?" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason said calmly, "She won't know how to do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick said, "Okay, Mason, no matter what, if you don't go to school and stay at home, your parents will worry." As the eldest of the triplets, Mick has the most stable personality among the three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big brother, for me to go to school now, it's meaningless," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once upon a time, he wanted to go to school just to spend more time with Veronica, but now... she must have grown tired of him. Even if he sat next to her, she wouldn't want to look at him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was about to say something when suddenly the door to the room was pushed open and the triplets' father, Jason, walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, are you guys chatting?" Jason asked. "What are you talking about? Can I join?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daddy, we just wanted to know why Mason isn't going to school," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, did you find out the reason?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper pouted, obviously not having found out anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, it's getting late now, you guys should go back to your rooms and sleep," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I..." Jasper wanted to say more, but Mick took his sister's hand and said, "Let Dad and Mason talk. We should go back to our room and get some sleep. We have to wake up early tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick had already figured out that their father wanted to talk to their brother alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper left reluctantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the room, only Mason and Jason were left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason said, "Your mother is very worried about you. What's going on between you and Veronica?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She found out that I was the one who caused the breakup between Daniel and her," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, when he mentioned to his father that he hoped to hand over the business to Daniel and his team, his father didn't ask any questions and simply agreed without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he knew that with his father's ability, he must have already guessed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, Jason didn't show any surprise on his face after hearing it. He even seemed to have anticipated that Veronica would find out about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened next?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I said I could be her boyfriend and treat her a thousand times better than Daniel ever could, but she doesn't even want to consider it," Mason said, a hint of pain in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at his son's appearance, Jason was reminded of his own past. "In this world, there are no impenetrable walls. If you do something and want to keep it a secret forever, you must also be prepared to be discovered by the other party."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, he thought he could keep the truth about Grace's imprisonment hidden forever, but in the end, Grace found out the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Grace eventually forgave him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's body stiffened and he remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason asked, "So, do you have any plans?"</p></div>
