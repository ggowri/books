        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Farah Steele, I don't want anyone to be hostile to my colleagues like this. And what you&rsquo;ve done by rallying other coworkers to isolate and bully another employee&hellip;it is harassment.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Grace indeed served time in jail, but she has paid her price to society, as deemed by our judicial system and the judges and juries upholding it. You do not have the right to continue to judge her or to invade her privacy by airing her past for others, with the expressed intent of it causing unrest in the workplace.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Farrah paled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; the director said. &ldquo;It doesn't mean that we should look at her with different eyes and not give her a chance to live. Since you feel that you can't work with Grace Cummins, I think you should quit your job now."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She... she was an established member of the staff! She was being dismissed just like that?! Farah couldn't believe it. She&rsquo;d done nothing wrong! She&rsquo;d told the truth!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Farrah, say something," the voice next to her urged.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Farah looked around. When she saw Grace, she suddenly felt a rush of resentment. She stepped forward and said to Grace, "It's you. It's all your fault. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been dismissed by the director! You should be the one who is made to leave!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was shocked. The person who was being dismissed was... Farah?!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Farrah, are you kidding?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How is this possible!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Farah glared at Grace, making no effort to hide her resentment. She drew back her hand to slap Grace and her arm was caught.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace ducked instinctively. She was no stranger to violence. But that didn&rsquo;t mean she had to stand there and absorb it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just stop already. The director wants you to go. What does it have to do with Grace? Can Grace control the director's decision?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace raised her head and saw that it was Chase.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the other people in the fleet saw this, they also went forward and shook their heads at Farah or dispersed so as not to get caught up in the drama surrounding her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The farce ended just like that. Farrah stalked off.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace stared at her as she left.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thank you," Grace said to Chase.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It was nothing. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have been targeted by Farah in the first place," Chase said with embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as Grace was about to turn around and leave, Chase suddenly said, "Is your younger brother really your blood-related brother?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace looked at him in surprise.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chase hesitated and said, "I just don't think... you're not like siblings." When he saw her standing with his brother, he felt like they were a couple.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"He's not my sibling, but to me, he is my family," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Family? Chase didn't quite believe it. Even if she was treating that man as family, was that man... merely treating her as a family as well?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When that man looked at Grace, his gaze looked as if she belonged to him. That was not how one looked at one's siblings!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">***</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Babe, are you listening to me?" Lily raised her voice and asked. Sean had been completely distracted the entire day. She must have asked him the same question three times now, but he had acted as though he had not heard her at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ah!" Sean suddenly came to his senses. "What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong with you today?" Lily asked in annoyance. "If you're going to accompany me to try on my gown tomorrow in this state, I might as well find someone else to accompany me!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lily, I&rsquo;m so sorry. My mind&rsquo;s on work, and I just remembered that I still have something to do!" Sean said. He suddenly stood up and rushed out of the private room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily couldn't ask anything before it was too late. She was left alone in the spacious private room with a big table full of dishes in front of her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily frowned. What the hell was so urgent that he needed to leave her alone like this? That it couldn&rsquo;t wait an hour until they finished dinner? He was totally different from his usual attentive self!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean drove the car and called his secretary. "Go to the Sanitation Service Center and check the address of Grace's place!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It didn't take long for the secretary to send the address to Sean's mobile phone.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean drove the car toward Grace's residence.</p></div>
