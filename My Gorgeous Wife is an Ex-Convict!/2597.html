        <h1>Chapter 2595</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you recognized your feelings in less than six months? Do you really think you&rsquo;ve fallen in love with a man you didn't even love not so long ago? Kyla, do you believe such lies?" He retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly explained, "It's not a lie. It's true. I thought I loved you too little and that you loved me too much. I was afraid you might become miserable if something happened to me. That's why I said those things. But now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice trailed off as her eyes rested on his right rib area where his liver was. It was where he had surgery for her twice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He followed her gaze, then his expression changed slightly. As if realizing something, he frowned. "You know about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He asked absent-mindedly, but she understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I do. I know you donated your liver to me again after I got my C-section," she said as her eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked enlightened. "So, are you trying to make it up to me because you feel bad and think you owe me? But you underestimate me, Kyla. I don't need a woman to make it up to me by saying she loves me in this way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No! I do feel that I owe you and want to make it up to you, but that has nothing to do with me saying I love you." She really loved him! She loved him before he donated his liver a second time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you didn't know that I had donated my liver to you again, would you have come to me and told me that you love me? Or would you have signed the divorce papers?" he asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze. 'Would I? If Grace hadn't told me the truth, what choice would I have made if I thought I was dying and he was healthy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She might actually...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Can't you answer that?" He snorted coldly. "Kyla, I would&rsquo;ve been so happy even if you had only said that out of pity. I would&rsquo;ve also willingly thought you loved me and let the lie go on. But I don't love you anymore. Do you think I care for your lies about loving me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every word he said slammed into her ears, filling her mouth with a bitter taste. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out this was the price of lying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had lied to him by saying that she did not love him, and he believed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now when she told him she loved him, he did not believe her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you think you don't care, I still want to say I love you. Not out of pity or because of the baby, but because I don't want to lose you," Kyla said with utter certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had lost too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't want to lose me?" He raised his brows slightly and seemingly looked at her nonchalantly. "But I don't love you anymore. Whether you want me or not, we've already lost each other, haven't we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, we... we haven't. Martin Weiss, even though you&rsquo;ve forgotten your feelings, you still have some feelings for me, don't you? You still have feelings for me, or you wouldn't have donated me your liver a second time!" If he had no feelings for her, he could have just watched her die instead of risking his health to save her!</p></div>
