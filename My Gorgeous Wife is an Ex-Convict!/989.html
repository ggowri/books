        <h1>Chapter 988</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glared at Terrence, expecting him to help her carry Jason in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Terrence only looked back at Grace with a dry smile. "Well&hellip; Please take care of Master Reed tonight. I'll pick him up tomorrow morning. You can call me at any time if you need anything tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Terrence thoughtfully took one of his business cards and put it on the small cabinet beside the rental house's door. Then, he helped Grace close the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt speechless. It seemed that Terrence was determined to leave Jason here today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do I have to stay with him all night?' She gritted her teeth and could only help him walk toward the bed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence got in the car, took one more look at the building's entrance, and sighed deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, he had not seen Master Reed this drunk in years. Master Reed had always been a calm and restrained man. He was always rational.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was how he was able to endure Old Master Reed's strict training methods and eventually took over the Reed family from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a man like Master Reed had drunk himself into a stupor with Young Master Hart today. The young men were drinking in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The paparazzi would drop their jaws if they found out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence sighed again when he recalled that Young Master Hart was no better than Master Reed when they left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the famous crown prince of the entertainment industry would fall in love with Grace? However, Master Reed refused to let Grace go when he had clearly broken up with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'God knows what sort of charms Grace has to make these two men get drunk for her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence would not be surprised if Emerald City was in trouble one day because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I wonder what Grace really thinks of the crown prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Grace falls for Brian&hellip;' Terrence could not help but shudder at the thought of this. If that happened, then Emerald City would really be in trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I better not even think about that possibility!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Under the yellow light, Grace looked at Jason who was lying on her simple wooden bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were closed. His hair was a little disheveled while his fair skin flushed with intoxication.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His long eyelashes would flutter from time to time. The light fell on his face, softening his features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, he had such beautiful features. He looked less unfathomable and temperamental than when he was awake. He looked as pure as an angel at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Angel... This word has nothing to do with him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A man like him could never be an angel.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace could not help but stare at Jason. Maybe he seemed so harmless now that it reminded her of when she had no idea of his identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he looked so innocent and pure to her. He was the one who would give her warmth when she was lonely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to do her best to protect this innocence. She even wanted to protect him forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After falling in love with him, the urge to protect him grew even stronger.</p></div>
