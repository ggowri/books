        <h1>Chapter 3649</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick quickly said, "Sorry, just pretend I'm not here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason looked at his daughter with annoyance. "What else do you want to happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... I didn't want anything," Jasper mumbled, shrinking her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let the two kids freshen up and have breakfast quickly. Otherwise, the breakfast will get cold," Grace finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Jason, who doted on his wife, he naturally went along with what she said. So he said to William and Jasper on the bed, "Alright, you two freshen up and come have breakfast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper quickly got out of bed, ready to rush into the bathroom, as if he had been granted amnesty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you planning to wash up here? Go back to your own room!" Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper obediently lowered his head and followed behind his parents and older brother as they walked out of the room. Before leaving, he made sure to give William a reassuring look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his room, Jasper hurriedly freshened up and changed into clean clothes before heading downstairs. He saw that William was already at the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to the people who had appeared in the guest rooms this morning, Mason was also present for breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard you two shared a bed?" Mason's first words to Jasper were exactly that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stumbled and almost slipped, his head almost hitting the table. "Well... it's just like when we were kids, sleeping together," Jasper explained with a dry laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, sharing a bed... it sounded a lot more significant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason usually didn't show any interest in this kind of gossip, so it was quite unexpected for him to bring it up now. It made Jasper wonder what he was thinking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not a child anymore, you're an 18-year-old young woman," Jason said. "You two can </span><span>be in a relationship if you want, but you can't continue like this in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was speaking to both William and Jasper, his gaze was only on William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," William responded, "I won't do it again in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper nodded along, behaving like a well-behaved student.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the terrible feeling of having her own daughter taken away by another man, Grace smiled and looked at William, "William, if Jasper does anything wrong, please be understanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper is great, she's always been understanding with me," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper, feeling proud, lifted her chin and said, "Mom, did you hear that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace laughed, "You're still..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing breakfast, Jason said to William, "Come with me to the study, there's something I want to talk to you about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William replied and stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper became nervous, afraid that her father would scold William and say something inappropriate, so she quickly said, "Dad, don't blame William. It was me who insisted on sleeping with him on the same bed yesterday. He didn't want to, but I forced him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words were spoken, the attention of the whole family immediately focused on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veins bulged on Jason's forehead as he exclaimed, "What nonsense are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling the truth, Dad. Don't scold him, scold me instead!"</span></p></div>
