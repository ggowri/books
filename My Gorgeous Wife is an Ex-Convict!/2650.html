        <h1>Chapter 2648</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller understood what he meant. He was giving her a choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she said she was willing to become Raymond Bowman's girlfriend, their agreement would be annulled and he would not trouble her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a deep breath and said sternly, "I'm your girlfriend. You said we'd keep dating unless I asked for a breakup."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flicker of surprise in those phoenix eyes. Then, Brian smiled faintly. "Okay, then we're not breaking up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked blankly at Brian's smile, unable to look away. She had always known that he was good-looking, but he had always been indifferent in front of her. Even when they pretended to be a couple in front of others, his smile was formal, and he was always indifferent when he hugged her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this smile seemed to carry emotion. It was different than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way Valda Theller gazed at Brian triggered Raymond Bowman. "Valda Theller, do you really think this man will love you? How serious is he about you? He just finds you new."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Raymond Bowman's opinion, Brian looked like those rich heirs he had met before. They were rich, fond of fooling around, and constantly got new girlfriends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had seen rich heirs like that all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller retorted bluntly, "Whether he loves me or not is between him and me, and I know how serious he is about relationships! When he loves someone, he puts in all his feelings. He&rsquo;s even willing to make many sacrifices. Raymond Bowman, you have no right to make speculations about his relationships!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke so forcefully that the two men present were stunned. They did not expect her to say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, Brian came to his senses and grabbed Raymond Bowman's hand. "I think Valda has made herself clear. If you bother my girlfriend again, don't blame me for not holding back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you going to do to me?" Raymond Bowman asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about crippling your hand? What do you think about that?" Brian replied indifferently. His bloody words sounded so icy when he said them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's expression changed, and he could feel the pressure of the fingers on his wrist. If he did not let go, the man would keep his word and cripple his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A layer of cold sweat broke out on Raymond Bowman's forehead. 'Should I release Valda's hand? But if I do, Valda and I...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Valda Theller suddenly gave her all and pulled her hand out of Raymond Bowman's grip. Then, she grabbed Brian's hand and said, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his eyebrows slightly. Moments later, he said, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got into the car, and Raymond Bowman watched the car leave with her warmth still on his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda..." Raymond Bowman murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she trust that guy that much? I must find out who on earth that man is!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not think that the man loved Valda because the way he looked at Valda did not contain the slightest trace of love! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
