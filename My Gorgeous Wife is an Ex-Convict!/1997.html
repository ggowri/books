        <h1>Chapter 1995</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had specialists responsible for her pregnancy check-ups, and Hadwin Stephenson would also accompany her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney were also arranged to stay in Hadwin Stephenson's private mansion. No reporters were disturbing them, but it was just to avoid unnecessary trouble. They would have video calls with their daughter every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Today, Hadwin Stephenson accompanied Lina to the hospital. Hadwin Stephenson waited outside while Lina had her examinations in the ultrasound room. A female nurse accompanied Lina inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The baby was doing okay, and Lina was relieved. However, when she walked out of the ultrasound room, she saw a woman standing in the VIP lounge outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was obviously talking to Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as Hadwin Stephenson saw Lina come out, he went over and asked, "Are you done with the check-up? What did the doctor say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Everything's alright," said Lina. Then, her eyes fell on the unfamiliar woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a beautiful woman with delicate makeup and high-end clothes. She was fashionable and looked just like the socialites in tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she said also confirmed Lina's speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You must be Lina. I'm Monica Keller from the Tang family and also the CEO of Keller Group." Although she was introducing herself, her eyes that were fixed on Lina showed disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She seemed to be filled with a sense of superiority. It was as if Lina was only an ant by her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her gaze made Lina uncomfortable. "I&rsquo;m Lina, the woman Hadwin loves most and also the mother of the Stephenson family's future heir."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina snapped back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Disgust flickered in Monica Keller's eyes. She did not expect Lina to say such a thing so shamelessly. She wondered how an ordinary woman with no family background like Lina could make Hadwin Stephenson announce the Stephenson family's future heir in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'd like to talk to Hadwin alone. Please don't disturb us," Monica Keller said to Lina with her sense of superiority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before Lina could speak, Hadwin Stephenson spoke first, "I don't think I have anything to say to you, Miss Keller." With that said, he prepared to leave with Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Monica Keller's voice suddenly rang out. "Hadwin Stephenson, you're going to lose tomorrow's board meeting if you leave now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stopped in his tracks, turned around, and looked at her coldly. "It seems that the Tang family is involved too. I wonder how many shares you have?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"A lot." Monica Keller raised her chin. "I can forget about what happened. If you get together with me, I can tell my dad to keep your position in Stephenson Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pursed his thin lips slightly as his eyes darkened. Lina, who was standing next to him, suddenly stiffened as she recalled what had happened that year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson had also used these methods to force Hadwin. However, she now knew that Hadwin made that choice back then not to get power and status but to save her life.</p></div>
