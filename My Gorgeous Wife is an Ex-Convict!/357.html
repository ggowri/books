        <h1>Chapter 356</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, he had always thought of Evelyn as a stand-in for the little girl he met when he was younger. Her lips were like those of the girl he remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that slowly changed. Sometimes when he was upset, it was as if he could calm down just by listening to Evelyn talk about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was clearly not the little girl who saved his life back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was because Grace looked like the girl. That was why he treated her differently. He could not help but want to be close to her when he saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Jason wanted the woman, and there was no need for him to offend Jason for a woman. After all&hellip; she was not the person he was looking for. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car crossed a road, Brian could not help but glance at the streets. He subconsciously looked at the people in sanitation service workers' uniforms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was in charge of sweeping this street!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not see Grace even when the car had already driven out of that area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a hint of disappointment in his phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it her day off? Or did something come up, so she did not go to work?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Brian did not realize how much he was speculating just because he had not seen her recently. When had he ever thought so much about a woman other than the little girl in his memories?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car stopped at a red light. Just as Brian was about to withdraw his gaze, he suddenly saw a figure riding an electric bike. That person also stopped at the stop line, catching his attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person was slim but was riding a man's electric bike. At the back of the electric bike was a large delivery box with the words &lsquo;Yan Yan Restaurant&rsquo; printed on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was stunned for a moment, but before he knew it, the red light turned green. The figure was already riding the electric bike to the right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Follow that electric bike with food deliveries!" Brian immediately ordered the driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, we're on a straight road. We can't turn," said the driver immediately. Besides, there were cars ahead. Even if he tried to make a turn to follow, there was no way he could push them away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian could not help but laugh. What was wrong with him? Did he really just have the impulse to ask the driver to follow Grace? It was just a woman. Was it necessary for him to go to such great lengths just to see her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how much she looked like that little girl, he should not care too much. After all, she was Jason's girl, was she not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the thought of this, Brian withdrew his gaze, leaned back in his seat, and slowly closed his eyes before saying, "Go back to the office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand once again subconsciously covered his chest. He hung the silver bracelet on a platinum chain and wore it on his body. The position of the bracelet that was against his heart seemed to be burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did letting go once mean letting go for a lifetime? When on earth would he find the little girl who saved him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If only he had not let go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When did finding her became an obsession of his?!</p></div>
