        <h1>Chapter 3860</h1>
        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't really explain it. Maybe it's because Daniel has become someone I never imagined he would be, or maybe it's because of what he said. Even though I don't really believe it, it still affected my mood," Veronica analyzed her feelings. "But don't worry, I just need to sleep it off and I'll be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you sure you're okay?" Now, Mason was the one feeling uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your family is very concerned about me, and so are my friends. Shirley sent me a lot of messages today asking how I was doing, and with you by my side, how could anything happen to me?" Veronica smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason looked at Veronica. "Yeah, with me by your side, nothing will happen to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she continued drinking her warm milk. After finishing her glass of milk, Mason said, "Rest well and go to bed early tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned around and was about to leave her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait!" She suddenly grabbed his sleeve. "Can you...um...sleep with me tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body suddenly stiffened, looking at her in surprise. "What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Veronica suddenly realized that what she said could easily be misunderstood. "I mean, can you...sleep with me, like we did when we were kids? Just sleep, nothing else...really, I just want to sleep with you innocently, I don't want to do anything to you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her nervous and blushing appearance made him smile. "I understand, you don't have to explain. But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He paused. "Even if you really wanted to do something to me, it's okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face turned even redder. He made it sound like she really wanted to do something to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go back to my room and freshen up first, and then I'll come over to keep you company," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Veronica replied softly, releasing her grip on Mason's sleeve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Mason left the room, Veronica walked over to the dressing table and looked at her crimson cheeks. She couldn't help but wonder why she blushed so easily for no reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She and him have slept together countless times since childhood, so why did she feel so flustered when explaining just now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or could it be...the one who's thinking dirty thoughts is actually herself?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mason walked into Veronica's room again, he had already changed into a dark blue pajama. He was carrying a blanket, pillow, and a sheet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at the things he was carrying, puzzled. "What are you doing with those?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to make a bed on the floor. You can sleep on the bed, and I'll sleep on the floor," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's not necessary. We used to sleep on the same bed when we were kids," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But we're not kids anymore," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But we slept together not long ago, didn't we?" For example, when they first started dating, he would stay overnight at her apartment and they would sleep together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That was different from now," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How was it different?" Veronica asked, confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Back then, I could control myself. But now, I might not be able to," Mason said.</p></div>
