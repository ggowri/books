        <h1>Chapter 3843</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of which, was it him who came to open the door here, or was it a senior he knew who called him and asked him to come here in a hurry, saying that Mr. Barlow was urgently looking for someone who could open the laboratory door?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William had naturally heard of this person's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the heir of the famous Barlow Group in Deer Capital, and also the boyfriend of Jasper from the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a hot topic on campus that these two were dating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, when he rushed to the laboratory, he saw Mr. Barlow standing outside the laboratory door, looking worried, angry, and anxious... all kinds of emotions mixed together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when he saw what was happening inside the laboratory through the glass door, he was almost shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he hurriedly opened the laboratory door and saw Mr. Barlow rushing over and punching Lawrence, causing him to stagger backwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, William hugged Jasper and turned his head to stare fiercely at Lawrence, "How long are you going to hurt Jasper? Do you understand how much pain she has gone through these years, and how happy she was to know that you were still alive?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about the scene from earlier, William felt like he was burning with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he could only watch through the glass door, but he was powerless to do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regretted not insisting on accompanying her into the laboratory earlier. He should not have allowed her to be alone with Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence was dangerous. Although he knew that Lawrence had an unusual feeling for Jasper, no one could say for sure whether he would do something dangerous at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when Lawrence encouraged Daniel to do what he did to Veronica and Mason, it represented Lawrence's prejudice and hatred, far more than one could imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence sneered, his jealousy undisguised in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, he was jealous of William, jealous of this man who had better luck than him. William was just a criminal's son, and even his mother had a grudge against the Reed family. But after becoming an orphan, he became the young master and sole heir of the Barlow family, and could be with Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, he also had a grudge against the Reed family, and after becoming an orphan, he was also adopted by a wealthy family. But now Jasper no longer even likes him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the first half of his life, he had similarities with William, but why were there such big differences in the end?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pain is only because of guilt, and happiness is only because I can alleviate her guilt by being alive," Lawrence said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think so?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence remained silent, only looking at Jasper, who was being held by William. "I only ask you the last question. Will your answer to the choice I gave you change?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was stunned, then understood what he meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To marry him and leave Emerald City, in exchange for giving up his hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her proposal was rejected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it won't change. I won't leave William, nor will I leave my family," Jasper said, looking directly at Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I understand," Lawrence sneered, but in his laughter, there was a self-mockery, as if he was mocking himself for not giving up hope and still fantasizing that he might hear a different answer from her at this point.</span></p></div>
