        <h1>Chapter 1919</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she was losing consciousness, her last thought was... 'I wonder how Jay is doing. Is he badly hurt? By the time I wake up from surgery, I should be able to see Jay, right?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'There are so many things I want to ask him, and there are so many things that I want to say to him&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While Grace was undergoing surgery, Lina was also undergoing various examinations, especially since she still had a baby in her belly. Some examinations could not be done, so those had to be judged by relying on the doctor's experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina has never been so nervous. She did not care about her injuries. She was just afraid that her baby would leave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Doctor, is my baby... okay? I'll do anything to keep the baby!" Lina said anxiously when she saw that the doctor was frowning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're having signs of a miscarriage..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina heard the word &lsquo;miscarriage&rsquo;, her hands and feet went cold. "Miscarriage? Am I... going to lose the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'This is my and Hadwin's baby! How could I lose the baby?' Lina felt even more upset when she thought of the truth Katherine Jackson had told her earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She would never forgive herself if she lost the baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're only having some signs. You need to rest. Don't get out of bed except for trips to the bathroom. I'll prescribe some medicine for you." The doctor comforted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina quickly said, "Okay, okay, I'll stay in bed! Will I be able to keep the baby then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It shouldn't be too big of a problem. Just try to stop yourself from crying. It&rsquo;s bad for your health and the baby," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina hurriedly struggled to contain her tears when she heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She would do anything as long as the baby in her belly was safe and sound!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney rushed over after they learned that their daughter was saved and got her whereabouts from the police. They were relieved to know that their daughter and the baby in her belly were okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, I'm fine, but Grace was kidnapped by Katherine Jackson. She got injured on her neck because of me. She even almost fell to her death. I need to know how she's doing," said Lina. Thinking of everything her best friend had done for her, Lina felt guilty for dragging her into such danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney comforted her daughter, saying, "With Jason taking care of her, Grace will have the best doctors treating her. But we really owe it to Grace this time. If it hadn't been for her, you might&rsquo;ve gotten..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney could hardly imagine it. They had learned some information from the police, so they knew how dangerous the situation was earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They were grateful that their daughter was alive now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That Katherine Jackson is a real pest. She made Hadwin Stephenson have a change of heart and break up with you. You have nothing to do with Hadwin Stephenson now, yet she still refused to let you go! The police said she's dead. That&rsquo;s what she deserves!" Mr. Sweeney snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Dad, Hadwin... never had a change of heart! He has never done me wrong!" Lina choked out the words. If it was not for the fact that crying would be bad for the baby in her belly, she would have been in tears by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What nonsense are you talking about? He never had a change of heart? If he hadn't, why are you pregnant and lying alone in a hospital while he's enjoying himself back in his city?" Mr. Sweeney yelled.</p></div>
