        <h1>Chapter 3939</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need," Nancy refused. "Mr. Reed can spend some time with me. For me, it's already a rare opportunity. I'm luckier than most people, so even if in the end, you don't like me, it's okay. You don't owe me anything, and you don't need to give me money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick sneered lightly. "Is that so? But why do I always feel like your so-called liking for me can be withdrawn at any time after I confirm that I don't like you? Is it really because of your self-awareness? Or...maybe you don't actually like me that much, or maybe not at all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was very flat, as if he was just talking about an ordinary matter, but his black eyes were sharp as they stared at her, as if he could see through her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt her whole body tense up, her heart pounding wildly, and even her palms unconsciously sweating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, there was a knock on the door of the private room and a waiter walked in with the dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, let's eat," said Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The dishes were served one by one. Nancy herself worked in a five-star hotel and had seen many exquisite dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, some of the specialty dishes at this club still impressed Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, upon tasting them, she found that the ingredients of these dishes were very particular, and some of the ingredients were rare and hard to come by, even if one had the money to buy them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How does it taste?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's delicious," Nancy replied honestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you like it, you can come here often in the future," Mick said. Watching her eat the dishes, he seemed to feel that they were even more delicious than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's no need for that. I'm afraid that if I get used to eating such delicious food, I'll feel uncomfortable if I can't have it again in the future," Nancy said. "So it's enough to just have a taste of good food."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like you don't even believe that I could fall for you. Otherwise, shouldn't you be thinking that you'll have plenty of opportunities to come here and eat in the future?" Mick said. "If you don't even believe it yourself, how can you prove it to me and make me believe it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was at a loss for words and didn't know how to refute him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So if you want to prove that I really do like you, don't say such discouraging things in the future. At least, you have to believe it yourself that I really have fallen for you, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes flickered, and she couldn't read his gaze, but she was deeply attracted to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she was only using Mick at the moment, could she really remain unaffected by this man if they were to spend more time together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing their meal, Mick asked, "Is there anything you want to do with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Nancy was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't you say you wanted to spend some time with me to verify whether or not I really like you? So what do you want to do to verify it?" Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah..." Nancy bit her lip. She had thought about it before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For her, her only asset was her body. If she wanted him to help her deal with the Schultz family, the most she could offer was her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But how could she say it? Should she directly ask him to have sex with her? Or should she seduce him first?</p></div>
