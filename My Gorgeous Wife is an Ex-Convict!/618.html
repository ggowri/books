        <h1>Chapter 617</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, perhaps that was where the magic of fate lay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I... I've always felt that love was a luxury for me after I got out of prison. I never thought I would love someone again, but now I'm really happy to have met you and fallen in love with you. Sometimes, I even feel as if you&rsquo;re my salvation from God."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She muttered, telling him how she felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gave her hope again. He was like a knight sent by God to pull her out of the mire of despair because God found her too miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stiffened. 'Salvation? If one day she finds out what really happened, will she still think so?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, he would never let her find out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There would not be such a day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In fact... She was his salvation. If it was not for her, then maybe he would never understand what it felt like to love someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You would want to make her yours. Even if you held her every day and even if you already shared the most intimate contact... It was still not enough. This was not enough for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's get married, Grace!" Jason uttered these words with a suppressed endless desire. "Marry me, be my wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Get married?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned! She gawked at the person in front of her. She even forgot how to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? Won't you?" His brows furrowed slightly, and his heart almost stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you... Proposing?" she finally uttered after a long while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." He gave her this answer with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked. 'Proposing&hellip;' Had they come to the point of talking about marriage? It seemed they had come to know each other only less than a year ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... She loved him, and he loved her. They seemed to have no reason not to get married!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think this proposal isn't formal enough? Or do you think I'm joking?" His voice once again rang in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he lowered and kneeled in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback. She lowered her head and stared at Jason who was kneeling in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man that was so superior willingly fell to his knees&hellip; Just like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace." He lifted his chin and looked at her with his deep, bright eyes. "I'm serious. I've never been this serious. I can give you everything I have, including my life, so marry me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression was so serious that every word he said created ripples in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip and took a deep breath. As if with great courage, she said, "What... What if I can't bear you a child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been drinking the traditional medicine concocted by the hospital every day and was also receiving treatments from the hospital. Her uterus was gradually recovering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it had suffered a great injury after all. Even if she did have surgery in the future, it would only increase her chances of conceiving. It did not mean she would get pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was likely that she would never have children of her own.</p></div>
