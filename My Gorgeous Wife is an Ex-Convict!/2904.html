        <h1>Chapter 2902</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's gaze softened. "I know he's a good man, it's just that I'm not worthy of him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was clear that she lacked the confidence to continue walking with him and didn't have the ability to make him fall in love with her. Therefore, she had to choose to part ways with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them were stunned by Valda Theller's words and didn't say anything further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Brian Hart had already bought sanitary pads and Valda Theller took them and headed to the bathroom. When she came out, she saw Brian Hart waiting outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My stomach hurts because of my period, and it's worse than usual because of the stress I've been under lately. I don't need any special medication, just rest for a day or two and I'll be fine," Valda Theller said to Brian Hart. "So, I'm fine now, and..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice trailed off as she bit her lip and looked at the man in front of her. "This also means that I'm not pregnant, so we can both rest assured that there won't be any children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he heard her say "there won't be any children," his heart sank. When he went to buy sanitary pads for her earlier, he didn't even think about this issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now that she had said it, he realized that there was no longer any possibility of having children between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Rest assured...yes, you didn't want children in the first place," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not pregnant this time, maybe it's because fate thinks we're not meant to be together," Valda Theller said. "From now on, we'll go our separate ways, just like when we didn't know each other before. Except for pretending in front of Grace, you...don't appear in front of me like today, and I won't appear in front of you either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was afraid that the more she saw him, the harder it would be for her to part with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying this, Valda Theller turned and walked out of the emergency room, intending to take a taxi back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But before she could raise her hand, another hand had already grabbed hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take you home," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need, I can easily take a taxi," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, I'll take you home!" he insisted, his tone brooking no argument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller knew that if she refused again, Brian Hart might just carry her to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had already experienced this when she came to the hospital before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So she didn't refuse again and got into the car with Brian Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car headed towards her apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But when they arrived at the entrance of her apartment building, he didn't leave. Instead, he accompanied her to the door of her apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Hart, I'm home now, you can leave," Valda Theller said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't need to rush me to leave. After making sure you're okay, I'll naturally leave," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm really okay now," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" he looked at her, clearly not believing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a neighbor passed by the hallway and saw Valda Theller and Brian Hart standing at the door but not going in. The neighbor couldn't help but take a few more glances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, is this your friend?" the neighbor asked, but the slightly ambiguous look in their eyes clearly indicated that they were trying to find out if he was her boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes...yes, he is," Valda Theller replied awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your friend looks pretty good, you have good taste," the neighbor smiled and walked into the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't open the door soon, someone might come out and ask again," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated for a moment, but finally opened the door and the two of them walked into the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Hart, I'm inside now, do you have anything else to do?" she turned to him and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his lips and looked at her stomach. "Are you still hurting?"</p></div>
