        <h1>Chapter 491</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Oh, look at that, you&rsquo;ve called for a sidekick!&rdquo; The woman mocked Lina when she saw Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned and looked at her friend. &ldquo;Lina, what happened?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be bothered about her,&rdquo; Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The young woman burst out like a barrel of petroleum that caught on fire as she yelled, &ldquo;Why? Are you ashamed to admit that you shamelessly seduced my boyfriend? If I hadn&rsquo;t caught you in the act, were you going to strip naked and get into my boyfriend&rsquo;s bed!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina glared at the woman. &ldquo;Seduce? Do you think I&rsquo;m interested in this kind of man? What exactly is going through your brains? You only think that the problem lies with other people but have you ever considered that it&rsquo;s your boyfriend that&rsquo;s the problem!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I saw you with my own eyes yet you&rsquo;re still arguing with me about it!&rdquo; the woman yelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Bullshit! What did you see with your own eyes?!&rdquo; Lina argued back. She pointed at the man who was curled in a corner. &ldquo;Let me be frank. With his face, I won&rsquo;t bat an eyelid even if you offer him to me. Besides, I have a boyfriend who is multiple times better than him. What reason is there for me to be interested in this kind of man? Is he made of gold or money bills?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The younger woman&rsquo;s expression was full of mockery. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you have a boyfriend to begin with! That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re eyeing someone else&rsquo;s boyfriend. You dare to do it but you&rsquo;re too much of a coward to admit it? Who will believe this load of crap.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was fuming with anger. She wished she could open up the woman&rsquo;s head to see what was inside that made her so unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Even if this woman sees her boyfriend as treasure, does she think that everyone will think the same?!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I believe her!&rdquo; Grace spoke up and looked at the young woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Lina&rsquo;s boyfriend. Besides, what evidence do you have to prove that she had ill-intentions toward your boyfriend? If there isn&rsquo;t, we can sue you for defamation.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I saw it with my eyes, so how can it be fake?&rdquo; The young woman named Hattie Robson scoffed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is that so? What did you see?&rdquo; Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I saw her entering a fire escape stairway with my boyfriend to have a secret chat,&rdquo; Hattie Robson said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If you meant a fire escape route, then people walk past there all the time. It can&rsquo;t be considered as a secret chat anymore, can it? The most you can say is that they were having a chat. Besides, do you have more concrete evidence? Maybe a video or an audio recording to prove that my friend was indeed having an affair with your boyfriend? Otherwise, you&rsquo;re just blatantly defaming her,&rdquo; Grace said neatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson&rsquo;s expression became livid. What Grace said was a slap to her face. She blurted, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the same type of person as Lina. Both of you are probably the kind of women who go around seducing men.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina heard that, she rolled up her sleeves and was ready to fight the woman. &ldquo;What a b*tch you are, Hattie Robson! You can scold me but how dare you scold my friend. F*ck you. Even if I&rsquo;m going to be locked up for a night, I&rsquo;m going to beat you up first!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Hattie Robson saw that Lina wanted to march up to her, she chickened out and hid behind her boyfriend. Grace quickly pulled Lina back. The police officer who was in charge of the case immediately asked both women to pipe down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace finally understood what was going on. Two women got into a fight over a man, then both sides also sustained some injuries. Initially, her best friend wanted to just let the incident slide, but the other woman was not going to give up easily. She brought the incident to the police station and now they needed someone to bail them out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson&rsquo;s boyfriend was the reason for the fight, but he was not involved in the fight. Thus, he could bail her out. However, Lina needed Grace to help her.</p></div>
