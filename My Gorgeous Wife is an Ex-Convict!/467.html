        <h1>Chapter 466</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, I've had the video deleted. It hasn't been on the internet for long, and it won't appear on the internet again," he said while his fingers fell on her bruised cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression grew colder. "I'll have the family doctor come and check on you later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right, I'll just grab an ice pack later," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. I won't be relieved until you see a doctor. That's settled, then. Did you get hurt anywhere else? Did the security guards at the mall hurt you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine, I'm not hurt." She tried to put it lightly, not wanting him to worry about her. "By the way, I... I'm going to see Grandma tomorrow. I was going to buy something for her today, but I couldn't. Can we go out together after dinner later to buy something for her?" she said, deliberately digressing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her deeply for a long time before he uttered, &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was a knock on the bedroom door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason opened the locked door and there stood the butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master, the Atkinson family is here," said the butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glistened. "The Atkinson family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, upon hearing the words &lsquo;Atkinson family&rsquo;, stiffened again. She turned even paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Chairman Atkinson, his wife, and Miss Lily are here. They said they must see you," answered the butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll see them, then," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I'll arrange for it," the butler said before he quickly left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked back to Grace and whispered to her, "I'll go and meet them. Wait for me here. I'll be back in a minute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was still stiff. She stared at him with a look of confusion in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He ran his finger gently over the spot where she had been hit on the cheek. "I&rsquo;ll make sure you get your justice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Jason walked straight out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her hand in a daze once Jason was out of sight. She touched the spot where he had just run his fingers against.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What did he mean by that? Was he going to... claim justice for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a warm current flowing slowly into her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason came downstairs, the three Atkinson family members were already waiting in the living room.</p></div>
