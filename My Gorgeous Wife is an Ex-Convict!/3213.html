        <h1>Chapter 3211</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regarding the previous incident with the trending searches and now that he has been recognized, given her personality, she definitely prefers to keep a low profile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the way she is now, may also be a form of adaptation for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She is adapting to the various situations she has to face while being with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Brian took Valda's hand, lowered his head, and gently kissed the palm of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" Valda looked puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are truly a great wife. It's my good fortune to have married you in this life," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The one who is fortunate in this life is me," she replied with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, Valda and Brian went around tMason Swansonty during the day, which had a strong comic book atmosphere. There were also many well-known comic book artists living in tMason Swansonty, and Valda even visited a few of them with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, she would video chat with Camille, Grace, Kyla, Amber, and Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, they would have a group video call, almost like having a tea party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How was your honeymoon?" Camille asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was great," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then maybe you'll be pregnant when you come back from your honeymoon," Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda almost sprayed the water she was drinking, "Pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you still have no plans to have a child?" Camille asked. "You're already 30, and Brian, although he looks okay, is not young anymore. If you don't have a child soon, when do you plan to have one? Even if he doesn't pressure you, your in-laws will."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't say I won't have one, it's just... um, is it going to happen so soon?" Valda hurriedly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have no experience with that, you can ask the other experienced people," Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The experienced people, of course, were the others besides Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace cleared her throat and spoke as a representative, "Actually, getting pregnant can happen quickly or slowly, it's really unpredictable. Sometimes it comes when you least expect it, and when you really want it, it doesn't come. Anyway, just stay calm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, stay calm," Lina said. "But hey, I really want to see your and Brian's baby soon! It must be a beautiful baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When these women talked about children, they couldn't stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Kyla said, "By the way, did Jasper find the boy she was looking for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What boy?" Valda asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"On your wedding day, Jasper heard a little boy playing the piano in the hallway near the utility room, and she wanted us to help her find the boy so she could hear him play again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't Jasper good at playing the piano? Does she also want to listen to other children playing the piano? Does that child play better than her?" Valda was a bit surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she had heard Jasper play the piano before. When she first heard him play, she was completely stunned. She never expected a child to play so well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's not the case. She said that the boy's finger technique is not so smooth in some places, but the sound of the piano has a certain charm," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other people on the video call are not experts in this field, so it's difficult for them to understand what "charm" really feels like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Jasper interested in the little boy and trying to find out more about him? What about the Barlow family's child?" Lina suddenly asked.</p></div>
