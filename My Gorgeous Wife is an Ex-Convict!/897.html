        <h1>Chapter 896</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Children of Nelson's age loved bubbles, especially toys that were shaped like a gun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before long, there were bubbles all over the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the bubbles inside the house, Chase Harper felt a little embarrassed. "I... Well... Maybe I'll take Nelson outside to play for a while. I'll bring him back later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Thank you," Kyla said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No worries. I enjoy playing with Nelson," Chase Harper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was excited to play with the bubbles outside, so he went out with Chase Harper happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Kyla asked Grace, "Why did you come here with him today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I had to see him for some work and he happened to have gotten Nelson a gift, so we came together," said Grace. Then, she glanced at the luggage. "What about you? When are you going to G City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In three days. We found a moving company to ship some of the furniture. I'll take the high-speed train with my mother and Nelson," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What time is your train? I'll come to see you off," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. It's not a weekend, so you have to work. Thank you anyway. I'll tell you when we&rsquo;ve arrived in G City. Besides, if you come to see me off, Nelson might not want to leave," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. "Then I wish you a pleasant journey!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you. I hope we'll have a pleasant trip." Kyla smiled. 'I hope my move to G City will bring me the peace I want.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I hope... I never see Martin Weiss again!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, what do you think of this necklace?" Paisley Daniels raised her chin slightly to reveal the diamond necklace on her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The brilliant diamonds sparkled under the lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss glanced at it and said, "It's nice. Buy it if you like it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It costs 80 million though." Paisley Daniels sounded hesitant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As long as you like it, it doesn't matter how much it costs," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing that, Paisley Daniels smiled. Her delicately made-up face seemed to grow more attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She actually wanted a diamond ring rather than a diamond necklace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Even though he had promised to announce their wedding date at the party in a few days, he had yet to give her a diamond ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a nagging fear in her mind that something might happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels looked at the other jewelry casually before deliberately exclaiming, "Wow, this ring is beautiful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is our latest limited-edition wedding ring. The diamond on it is the Mermaid's Tear that made the news last year. Our company won its bid to create this limited-edition ring," said the sales assistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels picked up the diamond ring and examined it carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, she was just trying to lead the conversation to her wedding ring, but the more she looked at the ring, the better it looked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin..." Paisley Daniels bit her lip slightly and looked at Martin Weiss. "This ring is so beautiful. Why don't we&hellip; make it our wedding ring?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes fell on the diamond ring. It was named Mermaid's Tear because the diamond's original shape resembled the shape of a teardrop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tear reminded him of the last tears that the woman had shed for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those eyes that were once full of love and hate turned into serenity as tears silently streamed down.</p></div>
