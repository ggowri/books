        <h1>Chapter 208</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"T-there you are," Grace said dryly while leaning sideways to let Jason into the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis, you must've waited a long time." Jason laughed and walked over to the desk. He saw copies of the case file which Grace had left opened on the desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His black eyes squinted slightly as he reached out to pick up a few documents and looked through them. "Is Sis looking at that case again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's body stiffened a little. She had mentioned this case to Jason before, but at the time, she did not know his true identity. Now that she knew, there was a lingering embarrassment and helplessness to talk about this case again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, no matter how much she thought she was innocent, the car accident had really happened. Plus, the person who died in the car accident was his fianc&eacute;e!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong, Sis?" Noticing her delay in answering, he looked up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just... looking," she replied as she swallowed the sudden flow of saliva in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, Sis, you always said that you were wronged. Are you trying to reverse the verdict by looking at these materials?" He was talking as if he was just chatting casually, but a dark look flashed deep in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip. Of course, she wanted to reverse the verdict! It was just that the witnesses from then were nowhere to be found, and the physical evidence was all a heap of hard evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During her three years in prison, Lina had spent so much money, time, and energy to overturn her case but failed. When Grace got out of jail with no money in hand, she even had to ask her best friend to help cover her medical expenses that cost just short of ten thousand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having been a lawyer herself, she knew how much it would cost to get a lawyer to overturn a case and to reopen an investigation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the absence of conclusive new evidence, the police could not waste police resources to re-investigate. She could only investigate everything alone, but she did not have the finances to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she looked straight at him. "How about you? Don't you want to get to the bottom of the case? Find out why your fianc&eacute;e drove her car in my direction? Is there something else going on? Don't you want to know why the woman you love did it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He broke into a chuckle. "The woman I love, eh?" At the end of his sentence, his voice slightly rose as if he had heard a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jennifer Atkinson was your fianc&eacute;e. Isn't she... the woman you love?" She was confused at his reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He put down the documents in his hand and slowly walked up to her, peeping down at her. "Sis, you've got half of it wrong. Jennifer Atkinson was my fianc&eacute;e, but she's not my the woman I love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was startled, his voice still ringing in her ears. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haven't Sis heard of commercial marriages?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes widened abruptly. Of course, she knew about commercial marriages, but she never thought that someone like Jason would need one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Jason and the Reed family, in a sense, ruled Emerald City. Even if it was a marriage with the Atkinson family, it would be at best an addition rather than a necessity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not the only one who thought so. A lot of people might think so too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no lack of Jason's &lsquo;love&rsquo; for Jennifer Atkinson in the chatter about him online. They all thought that he was deeply in love with Jennifer Atkinson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was why he got engaged to Jennifer Atkinson at the young age of 24. Besides, after her death, he never dated anyone else or had any scandals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&hellip; wanted a commercial marriage? You were only 24 years old at the time," she asked breathlessly.</p></div>
