        <h1>Chapter 821</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After all, nowadays, there are many Cinderellas who disdain the domineering presidents&rsquo; money and prefer to live a miserable life while dating them.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The female colleague thought that this might be the case. Earlier, several of them got together and talked about who exactly paid the bill last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Grace denied it. 'He once was, but not anymore.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Eh? No?" The female colleague looked surprised, not expecting Grace to deny so straightforwardly. "But Andrea Schwartz said..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does my boyfriend have to be whoever she says?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other woman was stunned, not knowing how to continue the conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked out of the pantry with a glass of water in her hand. She returned to her seat and began the tasks at hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dating was way in the past now. All she wanted to do now was work well and work hard in this city... to become a lawyer again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only in this way could she be worthy of those who loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was distracted at work all morning. Her mind was full of Hadwin's face and the things he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He said... he can be the sword in my hand even if the person I'm dealing with is Jason.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Never had a man said such a thing to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This sounds like sweet talk no matter how I look at it! He would have to involve the entire Stephenson Group if he&rsquo;s to go against Jason. No rational person would be willing to suffer such a loss.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Hadwin made her feel like... it was real when he said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he could involve the Stephenson Group he spent so many years and effort to get and risk losing everything for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Usually, the biggest possibility a man would do this for a woman was because... he had fallen in love with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could Hadwin have possibly fallen for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was immediately doubtful when she thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'There's a possibility that Hadwin hates me. As for loving me... It&rsquo;s most likely that he said these things to make me fall in love with him, and once I do, he&rsquo;ll finally get his revenge!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's the most plausible explanation, right?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Somehow, her heart could not calm down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina!" A voice suddenly rang in her ear, causing Lina to come back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she realized that she had arrived at the land bidding center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, there were several plots up for auction. Naturally, companies like their design firm wanted to establish a good relationship with those real estate companies. Several powerful real estate companies in Emerald City had come over to bid for the plots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director of Lina's design firm brought a few designers over so they could be the first to hear about the land auctions. Then, they could pull some strings and see if they could win over the design projects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was one of the several designers who came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of today's plots was a popular commercial land, which was planned to be built into a shopping mall cum serviced apartment. Lina was quite interested in this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, anyone who was ambitious about design was interested in challenging projects. However... Lina reckoned that her design firm would not get such a project considering their current size.</p></div>
