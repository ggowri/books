        <h1>Chapter 607</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'll do it myself," she said, blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent for a moment, then handed her the clothes and turned away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blushed and quickly put on her clothes. She did not notice that Jason, who had turned away from her, was now clenching his hands tightly in a fist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of her changing her clothes was a thrill to him at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even in the car, he had suppressed the desire to take her, but it did not mean that the desire was gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was because of Brian that made him want her more than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that he did not want to frighten her anymore. He did not want her to look at him with panic and fear. He did not want to lose his mind on impulse and hurt her uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he was willing to suppress this impulse and desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace was done changing her clothes, Jason turned around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had now changed into a long yellow dress, and the torn floral dress was on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason bent down to pick it up and said, "I'll buy you another dress later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks," she said hastily. "The dress was meant to be a replacement for the clothes that were splashed by tea anyway. You've bought me a lot of clothes. There's no need to buy another one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then, I'll ask the servants to throw away this dress," he said and was about to call for the servant when she hastily took the dress from his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'll throw it myself." The way the dress was torn would be enough for people to make all kinds of assumptions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That works too," he said, taking her hand again to look at the bruises on her wrists which were already a little lighter than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me rub it for you so that the bruises will fade faster," he said, gently rubbing Grace's wrists with his finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His strength was just nice, and she felt comfortable with him rubbing her wrists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was still a faint pain earlier. As he rubbed it, the pain seemed to have disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you feeling better?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, much better," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take a break first," he said, starting to leave the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" Grace suddenly stopped Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was stunned and turned around to look at her. The next moment, her hands were around his neck while she rose on tiptoes. She took the initiative to stamp a kiss on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're the only one who I love and desire for. Therefore, you don't need to be insecure. I won't leave you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said this to him, her almond-shaped eyes gentle but also determined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. She... Knew what he was afraid of? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not leave him? Did she know what this meant to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason immediately threw his arms around Grace and kissed her back hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, now that you've said it, you mustn't go back on your words. You mustn't leave me," he muttered. It was the strongest attachment.</p></div>
