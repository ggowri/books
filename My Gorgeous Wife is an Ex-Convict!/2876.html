        <h1>Chapter 2874</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"May I help you?" The store assistant asked politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated for a moment before finally saying, "The morning-after pill, please." These few words seemed to have explained everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The store assistant glanced at Valda Theller and said, "Please follow me." He led Valda Theller to the relevant medicine shelf and handed it to Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The store assistant kindly warned, "It's effective up to 72 hours after intercourse, but it's an emergency treatment. Don't take too much of it. It&rsquo;ll hurt your health if you take too much of this medicine. You&rsquo;ll have trouble getting pregnant when you want a baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Valda Theller. She saw compassion in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking the medicine box, Valda Theller paid for it and walked from the pharmacy to her apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since they had broken up, it should be a clean break-up. Even though getting pregnant was a slim possibility, Valda Theller still wanted to be safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though... she used to wonder what their child would look like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she would be selfish if she gave birth to the baby and left them without a father. She would be putting shackles on Brian as well. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he ever met a woman who could rescue him from his messy relationships, the child would only give them trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, it would be best if she and Brian had no children together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would consider everything last night a dream. Everything would be forgotten after waking up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller suddenly stopped in her tracks when she reached her apartment entrance. A familiar figure was leaning against her apartment entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's plastic bag suddenly slipped from her hand and fell to the floor. The contents of the bag also slipped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're back," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What brings you here?" Valda Theller asked in a mutter as her heart kept beating. Just hearing Camille say his name had made her nervous, let alone now when she was meeting him face-to-face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't I come?" he asked instead of answering her question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned away, not daring to look at his face. What they did in bed the night before kept stirring her nerves, and her heart felt as if it was about to leap out of her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We've broken up. There... There&rsquo;s no need for you to come here," she said as she crouched down to pick up what she had dropped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a hand picked up the medicine faster than she did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the morning-after pill she had just bought from the pharmacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face instantly paled while Brian stared at the medicine box in his hand and read the description on the medicine box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You bought this medicine. Did something really happen between you and me last night?" he asked, suddenly closing in on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. Nothing happened!" Valda Theller denied it almost subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not believe a word she said.</p></div>
