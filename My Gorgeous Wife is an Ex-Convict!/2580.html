        <h1>Chapter 2578</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well&hellip;" Amber Mitchell nodded. "I&rsquo;ll be studying archaeology in Emerald City for at least three years. After that, I&rsquo;ll consider whether I want to stay in Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not going back to Deer City?" Kyla asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Deer City...' There was a flicker of gloom in Amber Mitchell's eyes. Deer City was a sad place for her. "I&rsquo;ll go back to Deer City to pay my respects during Tomb Sweeping Day, Winter Solstice, and Herman's death anniversary. I&rsquo;ll also go back if my son needs anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her opinion, Herman and her son were the only ones in Deer City holding her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The fact that she sold the shares of Mitchell Group was the best proof she wanted to leave Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How's Simon?" Kyla asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The doctor said that he's doing okay. Perhaps he can leave the hospital healthy after a period of treatment," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good." Kyla breathed a sigh of relief. As a mother, what scared her the most was something bad happening to her children. "Does he know you're his biological mother yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell shook her head. "I don't know if he knows. I've only met Simon a few times. Sometimes, I think it would be better for him not to know that I'm his biological mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the feud between the adults was so intense that the child might not be as happy as before if he found out about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, enough about me. Trista is so cute!" Shifting the subject, Amber Mitchell began to tease the baby in Kyla's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although born premature, the little one had grown to two and a half kilograms after a period of careful feeding in the incubator. She could be fed like regular babies now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one looked tender and adorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "She's still a little skinny. She drinks less milk than other babies who are born full-term. It's a pity she has been drinking baby formula since birth and has never had her mother's milk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;ve done enough for her. She'll understand your hard efforts when she grows up," said Amber Mitchell as she took out a red envelope. "Alright, it's my first time meeting the baby today. I'm giving her a red envelope for good luck!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla immediately rejected it and said, "That's inappropriate. Take it back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell chuckled and said, "It's for the baby, not you. You're just keeping it for her. You gotta give it to her later! Besides, I've sold my shares. I have enough money to last me for several lifetimes. You don&rsquo;t have to be conscious about my money.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla then accepted the red envelope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here, let me carry the baby. She's so cute. I want to carry her." Amber Mitchell seemed like she could not wait to carry her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla then carefully handed her daughter to Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell hugged the tiny and soft body carefully. Watching the little one pouting in her arms and spitting bubbles&hellip; Her eyes grew red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was Simon like this when he was born? Was he this adorable too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had never even held Simon once since he was born.</p></div>
