        <h1>Chapter 1371</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glimmered a little. This was true. She would not have asked him for help if Lina had not been seriously injured. Naturally, she would also not have agreed to marry him so easily at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll think of a way to get Hadwin Stephenson to come to Emerald City so that you don't have to travel between two cities," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if he won't come to Emerald City?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He'll come. I'll tie him up and bring him to Emerald City even if he refuses," he said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as it was her wish, he would help her realize it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Grace met up with Hadwin Stephenson. However, Hadwin Stephenson had come to Emerald City with the Jackson family's heiress&mdash;Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace had seen photos of Katherine Jackson before, she found that the woman was indeed more stunning than the photos when she met her in person. It was as if she was born with an alluring temperament, making it easy for men to fall for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Hadwin Stephenson could not possibly be one of those men! She had seen Hadwin Stephenson's love for Lina. Would Hadwin Stephenson fall for Katherine Jackson? She wanted to hear Hadwin Stephenson's answer anyway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Jackson, I'd like to speak to Hadwin Stephenson alone. Is that alright?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, there's no secret between Hadwin and me, so Mrs. Reed, you can say anything to our faces. If Hadwin can hear it, so can I," Katherine Jackson said with a faint smile as she sat next to Hadwin Stephenson, seemingly casually pulling his hand and playing with his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson did not stop Katherine Jackson from doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Grace could not help narrowing her eyes. Her anxiety began to increase. "Okay. Hadwin Stephenson, I would like to ask you how on earth Lina got hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina's injury probably had something to do with my two half-brothers who are from a different mother. The police have taken my statement about everything I know. Grace, you can ask the police if you really want to know," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace naturally knew the contents of the statement, but Hadwin Stephenson's two brothers only admitted that they had indeed kidnapped Lina to threaten Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, Lina was accidentally seriously injured in the kidnapping process and they left her in a barren mountain. However, they had no idea why Lina appeared near Emerald City with serious injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you do anything when Lina was kidnapped?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said lightly, "I wanted to save her, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to. I didn't know that my two brothers had left her in a barren mountain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Hadwin Stephenson who was in front of her. His expression was indifferent when he talked about Lina as if he was just talking about an ordinary person, rather than the woman he loved deeply. His eyes... did not even contain any emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How can he do that? Lina loves him so much! But how can Hadwin Stephenson... talk about Lina so indifferently?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he know that Lina almost died?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if sensing her anger at the moment, a large hand gently covered hers, which also made Grace shudder and come to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's Jay&rsquo;s hand!' She looked at Jason who was sitting beside her, and her mood gradually calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said to Grace, "Alright, let me ask the questions now." With that, he looked at Hadwin Stephenson and said, "President Stephenson, do you know that Lina was found in a small village near Emerald City?"</p></div>
