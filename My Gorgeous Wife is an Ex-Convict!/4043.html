        <h1>Chapter 4041</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's moves are fast, fierce, and accurate, with no unnecessary fancy moves, going straight for the vital parts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally, Pearl's moves also have this flavor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Pearl is not the kind of child who acts recklessly. On the contrary, at a young age, she is sensible enough to make Jasper, an adult, amazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, I see that Pearl seems to really enjoy being a big sister. Have you considered having another child?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to, but Mason doesn't want to," Veronica said. It's probably because of her traumatic experience during childbirth that he worries about any accidents if she were to have another child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially after Nancy almost lost her life giving birth, Mason became even more opposed to having another child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This has caused Veronica a lot of headaches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hopes that at least one family can have two children, and Pearl also wants a younger brother or sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But unfortunately, her husband disagrees. Every time they have sex, Mason takes full responsibility for contraception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Our men are just cowards, but this is proof that they love their wives," Jasper laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that the matter of Veronica having a second child is still a long way off!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for the eldest brother... I'm afraid he is even less willing to have a second child than Mason, given what his wife went through during childbirth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who knows, maybe this heavy responsibility will fall on my shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But how many children does she want to have? Two? Three?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper used to like children, and as the number of the next generation in the family gradually increases, she also has the urge to have a baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she had a child with William, it would definitely be very cute!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passed day by day, Nancy's body gradually recovered, and Sophia grew up day by day, becoming stronger and healthier. Although she seemed to cry more easily at night than other children, she was still getting better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one's big movements also kept up with her developmental level, and every check-up received good feedback from the doctor, which finally made Nancy feel more at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half a year passed in the blink of an eye, and the wedding was getting closer and closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally, this wedding also received various attention from the outside world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, this was the wedding of the eldest son of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it is still unknown who Jason of the Reed Group will hand over to, Mick's outstanding ability alone has already stabilized half of the Reed Group's power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people even believe that with Mick's talent, even if he goes solo, he could create a business that is no less than the Reed Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just the countless patents in Mick's hands are enough to make people envious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a computer genius, Mick established the computer system and cloud computing strategy of the Reed Group during his university years. There are always many hackers who like to challenge the Reed Group's firewall, but so far, no one has succeeded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Based on these things alone, Mick's reputation as a genius is already established.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the day of the wedding, when Nancy put on that pure white floor-length wedding dress and looked at herself in the mirror, she suddenly felt a sense of trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did she really...marry that man who was once out of reach?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She once thought that her life was only dark, and even when she chose to jump off the cliff, she was determined to die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, everything that happened afterwards seemed like a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gave birth to a daughter and married Mick. It was so beautiful, yet so unreal.</p></div>
