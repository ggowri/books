        <h1>Chapter 3646</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If possible, he wished he looked completely different from his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hands and placed them on his face, murmuring to himself, "I will not forgive, never..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who abandoned him, what right did they have to ask for his forgiveness?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished washing up and lay in bed, closing his eyes, his mind was filled with constant dreams of the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dreamed of following behind his mother, often hearing her curse incessantly, and even if he annoyed her, she would slap him and even kick and punch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But sometimes, his mother would suddenly become a different person, treating him kindly and appearing to be a loving mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't understand why his mother would switch between being kind to him and despising him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, he gradually stopped bothering his mother, quietly trying to make her ignore his existence as much as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He no longer expected his mother to love him, he only asked her to stop hitting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He no longer told his mother what he wanted or what he liked, he simply did what his mother </span><span>asked of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, in the end, his mother still used him, claiming that he was Sean Stevens' child, just to use Sean against Auntie Grace and the Reed family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mother's eyes, he was nothing more than a tool!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know that you're just a burden? A burden! Why did I have to bear such a burden like you?!" His mother's voice kept echoing in his ears, making him feel like even breathing became difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone like you, a burden, no one would want you if you left me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better listen to me. If I die, you won't be able to survive either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These threats, these angry words, came rushing at him like a tide from all directions, threatening to completely engulf him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No... please, stop saying that. He will survive! He is not a burden, he's not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" William suddenly opened his eyes, and what greeted him was a brightly lit room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he having a nightmare just now? But he had definitely turned off the lights before going to sleep, so why were they on now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, what's wrong?" Jasper's voice rang in his ears, and then, that familiar face appeared before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked at Jasper in confusion before finally exhaling deeply. "I...I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of nightmare did you have? You're sweating so much," Jasper said, wiping the sweat off William's forehead with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." He held onto her hand, feeling the warmth that eased the suffocating feeling from his dream. "I just dreamt about scenes from my childhood, about my mother constantly saying that I was just a burden."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those unbearable things that were hard to talk about with others, he could only truly speak about them when facing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She always felt that having me was forced upon her. At first, she didn't even realize it, and by the time she found out she was pregnant, it was already too late for an abortion. If she wanted to have a legitimate abortion in a regular hospital, she would need to provide detailed information. But for an illegal abortion in a black market clinic, she couldn't afford it. So in the end, she had to give birth to me in a small clinic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William murmured, "To her, I was a burden, someone who shouldn't exist, someone unplanned!"</span></p></div>
