        <h1>Chapter 3149</h1>
        <div><p>At this moment, a user named &quot;Grace 4+2&quot; suddenly appeared in the live stream and directly called out the accounts of those who had attacked Valda earlier. They said, &quot;Your comments just now have constituted defamation. If Ms. Theller needs to sue you, I will be her representative lawyer!&quot;</p><p>The atmosphere in the live stream suddenly became tense, and many viewers began to discuss the situation in the comments.</p><p>Valda thanked &quot;Grace 4+2&quot; for their support and said that she would consider taking legal action if necessary.</p><p>After the incident, the live stream continued, but the topic shifted to a discussion of online harassment and the importance of standing up for oneself.</p><p>At first, there were people in the live stream room who were mocking.</p><p>&quot;Is this Grace 4+2 trying to become famous by currying favor with the prince&#x27;s fiancée?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Or is it that this fiancée brought in her own group of online trolls?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Be careful not to overturn the car!&quot;</p><p>Someone said, &quot;This account... belongs to Barrister Grace! Oh my god, she is the Reed family&#x27;s lady, Jason&#x27;s wife!&quot;</p><p>As soon as the name Jason was mentioned, there was an instant silence in the live broadcast room, followed by an explosion of reactions.</p><p>&quot;Really? Jason&#x27;s wife is here too?&quot;</p><p>&quot;So, what about Jason? Will Jason come too?&quot;</p><p>Next, someone sent a message saying, &quot;I&#x27;m here.&quot;</p><p>Next, many netizens immediately confirmed that the account with the words &quot;here&quot; belonged to Jason&#x27;s personal account online!</p><p>In Emerald City, Mr. Reed is a well-known figure that everyone knows.</p><p>Now, the Reed family has come to Valda&#x27;s live broadcast, and even Mrs. Reed said she wants to become Valda&#x27;s proxy lawyer. What is going on?!</p><p>Moreover, this Mrs. Reed is a famous lawyer in the legal industry, with an impressive record and a very high success rate!</p><p>For a while, the live broadcast room was extremely lively.</p><p>At this moment, Tracy looked at the screen of Valda&#x27;s live broadcast on her phone, her face looking unpleasant.</p><p>Why did the Reed family also come to join in the fun?!</p><p>Originally, Brian was already a big trouble behind Valda, and now with the addition of the Reed family, it&#x27;s even worse.</p><p>Thinking of this, Tracy typed on her newly created account, &quot;A normal person&#x27;s leg wouldn&#x27;t just suddenly become lame for no reason. There must be a reason. Moreover, I heard that the prince&#x27;s fiancée has been missing for a year. Ordinary netizens are just curious!&quot;</p><p>Then she instructed a few people she had bribed to create a certain rhythm in the live broadcast room.</p><p>So, in the live streaming room, the screen was immediately flooded with requests to know the reason behind Valda&#x27;s limp and her one-year disappearance.</p><p>Some people even maliciously speculate that Valda eloped with someone and then came back to Brian when things got tough outside.</p><p>&quot;You mustn&#x27;t become a white knight, Your Highness!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, don&#x27;t believe any reasons she gives, no matter what she says!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows what she has been up to this past year!&quot;</p><p>While the netizens were having a good time in Valda&#x27;s live broadcast, Brian suddenly appeared in the camera&#x27;s view.</p><p>&quot;Brian!&quot; Valda called out softly. She had clearly told him before that she would be doing the live broadcast alone today, no matter what happened, and he could just watch from the side.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly approached like this.</p><p>&quot;I have recorded the accounts of those who maliciously slandered my fiancée just now. I will submit them to the police later. It should not be difficult to trace their IP addresses. Whether their comments were normal opinions or malicious slander will be fairly judged by the law!&quot;</p><p>When Brian spoke, those accounts that had previously slandered Valda suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Brian continued speaking to the camera, &quot;Valda is the woman I love the most in my life. As a man, I will do everything in my power to protect her. To me, she is the person I will spend the rest of my life with. Anyone who speaks ill of her is speaking ill of me!&quot;</p></div>
