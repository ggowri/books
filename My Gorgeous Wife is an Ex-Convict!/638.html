        <h1>Chapter 637</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss was getting deeper and deeper. She was like a naughty child when drunk, kissing him while her hands were busy stirring up the fire in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason felt like he was losing control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he grabbed her hands and gasped as he said, "That's... That's enough&hellip; Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it went on like this, he might just have his way with her in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blinked like a small animal, naive confusion in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Enough? Why do I think it's not enough... Not nearly enough?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I want him! I want him to always be there for me. It seems that with him around, I won't have to be afraid!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay..." she mumbled, her hands running unsteadily over his cheek. Her drunken eyes were finally on his face after focusing for some time. "You're... Hic... So good-looking," she murmured, hiccuping in between.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those delicate eyebrows and eyes looked as if they were painted on by an artist. They looked surreal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this man really my boyfriend? He's... Even going to marry me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've seen photos of... Jennifer Atkinson. She's beautiful... You and her... Seemed to make a good couple. The news back then always said you... Were the golden couple..." she went on muttering, "Do&hellip; Do you love her... Why... Didn't you look for the truth when&hellip; When she died..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words made him stiffen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps these words had been repressed in her mind when she was sober and only escaped her mouth now when she was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes lowered gently. "The only person I love is you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never loved Jennifer Atkinson. He had chosen the woman to become his fianc&eacute;e because the woman loved him enough, her family could help the Reed family, and she could produce a good heir for the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, he did not care about the so-called love and did not think that he would fall in love with anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tilted her head to one side as if she understood him. "Even if... You didn&rsquo;t love her, she's still your fianc&eacute;e... You&hellip; You should&rsquo;ve tried to find out the truth... How could you... Not investigate it... If you had investigated it, I wouldn't have... Gone to prison... I wouldn't have suffered so much&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She choked with sobs as she spoke. Tears the size of beans poured out of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry. I'm sorry&hellip;" All he could do was apologize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She threw herself into his arms and cried while he held her and patted her on the back. 'Find out the truth?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How am I supposed to tell her that I&rsquo;ve already found out the truth?' He knew all the while that she had been wronged. A word from him would have spared her such a heavy fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, of all things, he chose to sit on the sidelines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears were like brand marks, constantly branding his heart and bringing him great pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car stopped in front of the main house of Reed Residence, Grace had already fallen asleep as she was tired of crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason got out of the car with Grace in his arms. He went to her bedroom and placed her gently on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He carefully took off her shoes and socks, then gently unbuttoned her clothes and helped her put on her pajamas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The old scars on her body stung his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scars were a constant reminder of his mistakes.</p></div>
