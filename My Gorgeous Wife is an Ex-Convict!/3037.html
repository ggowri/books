        <h1>Chapter 3035</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda can relate to this. When her parents passed away, relatives, teachers, and classmates were all very careful around her, but they also talked behind her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, she was very clear about what they were saying and discussing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she seemed to have become someone special, who didn't fit in with those around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Simon, we can't stop others from discussing whatever they want, but we can make ourselves stronger. We can confidently express our own thoughts and not avoid interacting with people because of fear or annoyance. If you do, you'll only become more and more avoidant in the future," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon was listening, but it's unclear how much he actually absorbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda didn't expect the child to understand everything at once, as many things require gradual guidance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's one more thing that's very important," Valda couldn't help but say. "Simon, in the future, you must learn to distinguish right from wrong. Don't let appearances blind you and make decisions that you'll regret for the rest of your life. In this world, there are some things that can be corrected, like mistakes that can be erased with an eraser and replaced with the correct answer. But there are some things that cannot be corrected. Once you make a choice, you can't turn back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Like my dad and mom?" Simon asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda didn't say directly, but instead said, "If we think someone else is wrong, then in the future, we should try to avoid making the same mistake ourselves."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon listened, seeming to be deep in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They arrived at their destination, a tall tower by a lake in Deer Capital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three of them strolled by the lake and then climbed the tower together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Simon had been there before, he acted as a tour guide and showed Valda and Brian around the scenery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they reached the top of the tower, Brian saw that there were amulets for sale, so he bought three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One for each of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at the amulet in her hand with some surprise, then looked at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Don't you like it?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's just that I don't think you're the kind of person who would buy something like this," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe it's because sometimes people become more superstitious about things they care about," murmured Brian. And she, the one he cared about, "I hope this amulet can really keep you safe and protect you from disasters."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda smiled at the words and said, "Then I'll keep this safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then she squatted down again and said to Simon, "You also need to keep this safe. Uncle Brian bought it for us specifically to keep us safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one looked at the peace charm for a moment, then raised their head and looked at Brian. "I also want to buy one for my mommy. Uncle Brian, can you give it to her when you see her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian paused for a moment and said, "I can help you pass it on to your mom's friend, who can then give it to your mom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uncle Brian, aren't you my mommy's friend? Dad told me that you saved mommy," Simon asked.</p></div>
