        <h1>Chapter 2270</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We can only find out after a thorough examination in the hospital." The policeman quickly helped Kyla and Martin Weiss into the car as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Martin Weiss was still worried about Kyla. "Are you... okay?" However, his voice was hoarse. Even uttering a simple sentence was hard for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head, her tears still flowing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss raised his hand and gently wiped away her tears. "Don't cry... Kyla. Stop crying. There's no more danger, and I won't let this happen to you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought she was crying because she was scared. He had no idea that she was crying because her heart was aching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When did her heart begin to ache over the injures he suffered for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, why did you do it? Why did you cut your neck when Mr. Lambert asked you to? I'm... not that important!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "It's not up to you to determine whether or not you're important to me. It's... up to me. Besides, if I didn&rsquo;t do whatever he told me to, then... Mr. Lambert wouldn&rsquo;t have let his guard down either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop talking. The bleeding will only get worse if you do," Kyla said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I... won't talk. You shouldn&rsquo;t talk either..." he said that because she had wounds on her neck too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car immediately fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla and Martin Weiss's hands were clasped together. It was now hard to tell who was holding whose hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had many doubts in her head. For example, when did Martin Weiss hint to Mr. Lambert's men? Was it when one of them handed him the dagger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Also, if Mr. Lambert had not gotten carried away and let his guard down, would Martin Weiss have continued to hurt himself and leave more wounds on his own body?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The answer was clear in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He would&rsquo;ve! He would&rsquo;ve definitely done it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... knew how much he valued her and how much he cared about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man would die for her! It was why he insisted on getting his blood drawn and stored for her regardless of the risks. It was why he risked his life and hurt himself again and again just to save her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that she had been deceiving herself and trying to distance herself from him. She kept ignoring what she felt to cut off all her feelings for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at his increasingly pale face, Kyla only felt the unspeakable pain in her heart intensifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When his hand grew colder and his lips took on a grayish hue, Kyla was suddenly scared that something might happen to this man. She was scared that he would no longer exist in her world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only found his eyelids drooping more and more. His body was getting increasingly colder as well. It was so cold that it felt as though he could not hold on any longer and was about to fall asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'At least Kyla is safe for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'At least, I did what I promised. I... protected her and the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So just let me sleep for a while. Just a little while...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's great that Kyla and the baby are safe...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss blacked out and fainted. He never got to see the worried look in Kyla's eyes and hear her scream despite the pain in her neck, "Martin!"</p></div>
