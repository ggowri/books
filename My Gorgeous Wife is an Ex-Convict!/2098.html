        <h1>Chapter 2096</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, it was Kyla's private matter. It was inappropriate for them to talk about it in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, Jason said to his subordinates, "Go out first and submit a proposal to remedy the problem. If you can't solve it, then don't blame me for being ruthless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The men immediately filed out as if they had been granted a pardon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "What's the matter? Is there some trouble with business?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's alright. It's just that there are some issues with our previous acquisition, but I think we can work it out," said Jason. Then, he asked Grace, "What can I do for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's Kyla. I called Kyla earlier but the person who answered was Martin Weiss. I'm worried that Martin Weiss has Kyla with him," said Grace. After talking to Jason last time, she was always worried that if Martin Weiss really disagreed with Kyla, he would lock Kyla up or something. That would be terrible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So you can't reach Kyla?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Not really. Kyla said she&rsquo;s fine, but she sounded strange!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So you want me to find Kyla?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes." Grace looked expectantly at the person in front of her. "Jay, I'm so worried, and Kyla's pregnant. Hurry and help me find her, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her almond-shaped eyes were teary and full of worry. She raised her chin slightly as she pleaded softly. How could he resist?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I'll help you find her," said Jason. Then, he made a phone call with the internal line and told Terrence to find Kyla as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Poor Terrence just had some free time yet had to get busy again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While waiting for the news, Grace's mind had already come up with several hypotheses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason comforted her and said, "Don't worry. Martin Weiss won't hurt Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But what if he does?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss would probably rather hurt himself. He knows very well that he&rsquo;ll never get a chance with Kyla if he hurts her again!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze and said with a sigh, "Do you think there's still a chance for him and Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's up to Kyla. The choice has always been Kyla's to make, isn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, the choice is Kyla's to make. If Kyla wishes to start afresh with Martin Weiss, I&rsquo;ll give her my blessing. If she doesn't, then I&rsquo;ll help her stop Martin Weiss from troubling her again," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes glimmered slightly. "You're making me jealous of Kyla by saying these. She matters so much to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. 'No way. He's not jealous of Kyla, is he?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well... Kyla and I have been friends for many years. Of course, she matters to me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He bent over slightly, his dark eyes looking almost straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can value her, but not more than me. I want to be the only one who matters the most to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was overbearing and absolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, got it. You matter the most to me." Grace sighed helplessly and raised her hand to touch Jason's hair as if smoothing it.</p></div>
