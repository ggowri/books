        <h1>Chapter 2944</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When you two get married in the future, you must give me a matchmaker's red envelope," Grace joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled, wondering what her future with Brian Hart would be like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After chatting with Grace for over an hour, Valda Theller got up to leave. As she walked down the stairs, she saw Jason Reed coming back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, long time no see," Jason Reed said, looking up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not really," Valda Theller replied. "I came to see Grace and the baby today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see," Jason Reed suddenly said. "I heard you and Brian Hart broke up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stiffened. "Mr. Reed, what do you want to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't mean anything else. I just hope it won't affect Grace's recovery. Everything else is not important to me," Jason Reed said slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the man in front of her, who could easily turn the world upside down in Emerald City, but for him, all that mattered was Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a woman, how could she not envy that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think the same way," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you hate Grace?" Jason Reed asked. Valda Theller had heard Brian Hart talking about Grace in the hospital that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I hated her, I wouldn't be standing here now. I don't hate her because love is never about right or wrong. I just envy Grace and regret why the person who met Brian Hart when we were young wasn't me," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have the same regret," Jason Reed said. "I also regret why Grace didn't meet me when we were young."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Valda Theller suddenly felt that Jason Reed was not so unattainable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace doesn't know that you and Brian Hart have broken up yet. At least I hope you can continue to pretend to be in a relationship with him in front of her until she recovers. Consider it a favor I owe you," Jason Reed said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For ordinary people to make Mr. Reed of Emerald City owe them a favor was truly a rare opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need," Valda Theller shook her head. "Maybe Brian Hart and I don't need to pretend in front of Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh?" Jason Reed raised an eyebrow. Did that mean she was planning to get back together with Brian Hart? "Aren't you afraid it will be a difficult road?" he hinted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her lips. "It may be difficult, but I still want to try."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying that, Valda Theller walked away. Jason Reed watched her leave and smiled slightly. Brian Hart... he really had good taste.</p></div>
