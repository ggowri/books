        <h1>Chapter 2875</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he woke up this morning, he had no recollection of what had happened when he was drunk. However, the mess in bed was a silent indication that something might have happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He later learned from Patrick that Patrick had invited Valda Theller to his mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was here to confirm the events of the night before. The sight of the pills confirmed his speculation. Something did happen between him and her last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he confirmed this, he had no regrets and was even faintly happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Valda Theller, do you know what your expression looks like right now? You look like you're trying to hide something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I think we should talk it out," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We have nothing to talk about. I already said what I had to say that day at the hospital," she said, trying to back away to put some distance between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hand grabbed her waist and stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shouldn't we talk about last night? Valda Theller, no one in this world can take advantage of me and walk away," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was red in the face. 'Come on. I'm getting the short end of the stick here! I even got the morning-after pill!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't ask for it!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His phoenix eyes narrowed. "So I made the first move, did I? Then why didn't you say no? I should have been very drunk last night. Did you really have no chance to escape?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His remarks were straight to the point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze, not knowing how to answer for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, you're reluctant to leave me, aren&rsquo;t you?" His face closed in on hers. Her frightened face was reflected in his black pupils.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's heart trembled. Did he know what he was saying was bewitching her into changing her mind?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Breaking up was a decision she made with great difficulty because she did not want to be abandoned. She had no idea what she would become if she kept feeling jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Him not loving her turned out to be more painful than she had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not handle it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She met his eyes and said, "I wouldn't have bought this medicine if I was reluctant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air seemed to freeze at that moment, and his face turned ghastly pale!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian forcibly took Valda Theller to his mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, what are you doing?" Valda Theller struggled to get her hand out of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not the only one involved if you've gotten pregnant. And it won't be up to you to decide whether you want the baby!" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I have the right to decide if I want the baby, and I alone can decide if I want this baby!" When she finished speaking, she felt the pain of his grip on her wrist grow stronger. It was as if her bones would be crushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" He stared at her, a feeling of uncontrollable irritability sweeping through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her every word seemed to imply that she could not wait to get rid of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then we'll see if you can decide on your own whether you keep the baby or not!&rdquo; he said coldly.</p></div>
