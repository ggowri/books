        <h1>Chapter 2626</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cafe provided free drinks and cost ten dollars an hour. Valda Theller often came here to find some new comics to read.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the internet was advanced nowadays and one could read many comics online, she still enjoyed the feeling of flipping through paper books.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller led Brian to an empty couch and said, "If you have a comic you want to read, you can go to the bookshelf and look for it. What do you want to drink? I'll get it for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Water will do," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Valda Theller got Brian a glass of water and a glass of orange juice for herself. When she got back to her seat, she found Brian reading a comic book in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller froze when she caught a glimpse of the comic book cover. It was... the comic she drew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The problem was that she never told him her pseudonym was &lsquo;Zhong Xinyue&rsquo;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, on second thought, it seemed natural that he would know her pseudonym since he was able to find out her name, occupation, and home address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt a little awkward to have someone read the comic she drew in front of her. Especially when the male protagonist of the comic she drew was paranoid and overbearing to the person he loved. There were also a lot of intimate scenes in the comic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that he was about to flip to the page with the intimate scenes, Valda Theller quickly said, "Mr. Hart... Your water!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked up at Valda Theller and reached one hand out to take the water. "Thank you. Also, I think we need to confirm our nicknames for each other. We don't look like a couple if you keep calling me Mr. Hart. Don't you think so, Valda?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When his mouth uttered the word &lsquo;Valda&rsquo;, she felt as if her heartbeat had increased suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only female friends would call her &lsquo;Valda&rsquo;, while her relatives called her &lsquo;Lil Ke&rsquo;. As for her colleagues at work, they called her by her pseudonym, Xinyue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll call you... Bryn?" she called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look in his eyes changed instantly. However, his long eyelashes covered his eyes in the next moment. "Call me Brian. Don't call me Bryn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because it reminded him of Grace. It was what Grace had called him as a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Bryn... Bryn...' The name seemed to have been engraved into his bones and could not be erased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, okay," Valda Theller replied immediately, but she scolded herself for her stupidity earlier. A nickname like Bryn was usually used for kids. No one would call a grown-up man in his 30s Bryn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Try calling me that," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now?" She blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Otherwise?" he asked nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Li... Brian..." she called with some embarrassment as her lips moved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll get used to it after calling me that more often," Brian said as he looked down at the comic book he was holding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when he was about to turn the page, Valda Theller suddenly shouted in desperation, "Uhh... How about I find you another comic?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I haven't finished this one," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... But..." Her face blushed slightly.</p></div>
