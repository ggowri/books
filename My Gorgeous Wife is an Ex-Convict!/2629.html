        <h1>Chapter 2627</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glimmered as he seemed to realize something. He asked, "What's the matter? You don't like me reading the comics you drew?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I draw... romance comics for women. Men like you probably won't enjoy them. You don't have to force yourself to read the comics I drew," she said lamely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not exactly being forced to read them. I watch some romantic films too. I don't mind reading such comics. Besides, we need to get to know each other better," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But the problem is that... there's a lot of intimate scenes at the back!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching his fingers flip the pages again, she grabbed his fingers in desperation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm?" He raised his eyebrows and looked at her with those dark phoenix eyes. "You don't want me to continue?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She laughed drily. "Well... Some scenes at the back aren't that appropriate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if there's something largely inappropriate, it should be impossible to publish it according to the country's current publishing standards," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What I mean is that... Uhh... It's quite inappropriate," she explained hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright even if there's something inappropriate. Do you think I'm not fit to see that because I'm not 18 yet? But I won't read it if you don't want me to," he said in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze. After a moment's hesitation, she withdrew her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had hoped that more people could read the comics she drew. That way, she could share the stories and images she found beautiful with others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian continued to read it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could not help feeling nervous because she knew that the next scene involved a lot of kissing as well as the two protagonists&rsquo; wedding night. Although she focused on aesthetics and expressed the scene obscurely, anyone with basic common sense would be able to understand what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian read quietly as he turned the pages with slender fingers. Daylight fell on him through the window. Mixed with the indoor lighting, he looked so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had short black hair, fair skin, a straight nose bridge, and thin lips. Those deep phoenix eyes were looking down, making his eyelashes look more obvious. They looked just like feather fans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even in the entertainment industry where there were so many handsome men, there were not many male celebrities with eyelashes like his. Furthermore, the man in front of her was probably bare-faced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly had the impulse to draw down the scene in front of her. She took out a pen and a notebook she usually used to record her inspiration from her bag. She began to draw on the blank paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian finished reading the comic in his hands, he looked up to find Valda Theller drawing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was drawing... him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not a comic version of him but more of a realistic sketch portrait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't move. Just a while more!" Valda Theller suddenly said as her hand movements seemed to go faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes glimmered slightly, but he did not move as she wished and continued maintaining the posture earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his eyes were looking at Valda Theller sitting opposite him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face was no longer awkward and embarrassed before but absorbed. Even those round eyes showed an indescribable seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time a woman had looked at Brian like that. They were so pure as if they contained no other ideas, ambition, or desire, let alone infatuation. It was as if she was only looking at him.</p></div>
