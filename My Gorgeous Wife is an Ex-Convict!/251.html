        <h1>Chapter 250</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did quit, would it not be a waste of her time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to be a starlet. She wanted to be famous. She wanted to be the best actress!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced at Evelyn before asking Jason, "Does she bother you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's rather bothersome," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said this carelessly without lowering his voice too much, so the people around him could all hear what he said. At once, many of them, even those who did not like Evelyn, looked at her with pity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, there were only a few people who could make the boss of Emerald City admit that they were bothersome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In that case, quit,&rdquo; Brian said casually as if it was just a casual matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the words sounded like thunder in Evelyn's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Quit? Was she really quitting the show?! Just because of these two statements? How was that possible?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's eyes widened with disbelief. "Brian... You... are you telling me to quit the show?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's what you said. If Jason dislikes you, you'll quit. Since he dislikes you, what's wrong with you quitting?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn wanted to slap herself. If she had known this, she would not have said that to retreat for the sake of advancing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Great. He was letting her retreat to the end!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was so choked that she could not speak. The glances around her made her feel even more embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip hard. "Well... In that case, I'll leave before Mr. Reed dislikes me more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, all she wanted was to find a place where she could calm down, avoid the eyes of those around her, and think of what to do next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could even turn around, Jason once again said, "You haven&rsquo;t gone on your knees yet. Why are you in such a hurry to leave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's eyes widened. "What?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As a matter of fact, how many times did you get her to kneel for you last time? Let's kneel the same amount this time. Let me take a good look at how up to standard your kneeling and groveling is. You're an actress. You should do better than an extra. If you can't do it, then I don't think there's any need for you to stay in this industry," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this sentence seemed to decide Evelyn's future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Evelyn did not kneel today, then she probably would not be able to make it in show business in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was biting her lower lip till they bled. She looked at Brian as if asking him for help. Embarrassed and anxious, she shouted, "Brian..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unexpectedly, Brian's eyes fell on Grace's face. It was not until Jason's body got in front of Grace that Brian withdrew his gaze. He said coldly, "In that case, just kneel. How many times did you make her kneel last time? Just kneel the same amount of times this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men were facing each other in silent agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn could not afford to offend either of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh right, and don't forget to kneel in front of her." Jason added.</p></div>
