        <h1>Chapter 1536</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was the one speaking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I do. Jay, I want you!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Whose voice is that? It's... It's Grace's!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared at Grace and put his hand on his temple. His head seemed to be pricked by a sharp needle and waves of pain were spreading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, if you want me, then you can't leave me. Never!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, Jay, I won't leave you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace... Grace..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He kept calling her name as if it meant more than everything to him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His head... hurt! Those broken images flitted in his mind, but he could not get hold of them no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What are these voices and conversations? Are they... conversations I had with her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young Master, are you having another headache?" asked Uncle Kwan as he rushed forward after noticing Jason's condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason took a deep breath, but what came out of his mouth were groans. The headache was a little stronger than usual this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace, who was holding Mick Reed in her arms, also rushed over to Jason and asked nervously, "What's the matter? Are you feeling unwell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's face was pale with a layer of thin sweat on his forehead. He was frowning while one hand was pressed to his temple. There was a touch of pain in those deep eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young Master's probably suffering from a headache. I'll ask Dr. Guzman to come over," the butler said and hurried to make the phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Jason and quickly took out a paper towel to wipe the sweat from his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before her hand touched his forehead, his hand suddenly clasped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What... are you trying to do..." The words came out of his mouth almost with difficulty. Even his voice trembled because of the headache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just want to wipe your sweat off," said Grace. His fingers were clenching her wrist and it was painful, but she did not show it on her face. "Are you in pain? Stop talking. The more you talk, the more painful it&rsquo;ll be. Hold on for a moment. You'll be alright once the doctor comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her voice was gentle but firm. It was as if... her voice could reassure him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Some broken images seemed to flash across his mind once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you have a stomach ache? Jay, wait for me. I'm going to get some medicine and will be back in a minute..." The same voice rang in his ears and put him in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What was real and what was the past?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could not help looking at her while in a trance. At this moment, he could see them in a simple rental house. Grace was looking at him worriedly. Then, she ran out of the house at night...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The pain continued... then and also now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had no idea how much time passed, but he had a scene in his mind. It was of her coming back. She pushed the door open and ran up to him with the medicine. "Jay, I bought the medicine..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She came back. She did not leave him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sis..." A groan escaped his mouth.</p></div>
