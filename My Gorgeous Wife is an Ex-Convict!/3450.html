        <h1>Chapter 3448</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you know..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am your father, I naturally pay attention to everything about you, including the people you care about," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although his second son did not live with them often and had less contact with them, Jason's concern for his child did not diminish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, because of his son's self-isolation, he would give more attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that his wife felt the most indebted to their child who had been taken away by Secretary Wylie since childhood and had not grown up with his parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Secretary Wylie raised the child in such a bloody and cruel way that from a young age, the child's personality was difficult to integrate into normal society.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Mason's diagnosis doesn't classify as autism, he still doesn't enjoy socializing with others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, Veronica's presence has become increasingly important. Jason knows that his second son cares about Veronica much more than anyone in the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason stopped talking and Jason chuckled softly, "So, have you thought about what to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't let Daniel be with Veronica," said Mason, because Veronica can only be with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you do it? Or do we need to use force to keep them apart?" Jason asked. "With the power of the Reed family, we can definitely keep them apart. However, if we do that, it might damage the relationship between you and Veronica."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So we can't come on too strong, we have to approach it gently, right?" said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason smiled slightly and said, "It seems that you have really grown up and become more understanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica and Daniel are just starting out now, but in the future, they will definitely not be together," he said with a determined look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing this, Jason's previously worried heart settled down. It seemed that his son had his own ideas, so as a father, he naturally had to support him wholeheartedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, if you need any help from home, just ask, okay? You are a member of the Reed family, the child of me and your mother! The Reed family will always be your support," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Mason looked steadily at his father and after a while, he said, "Okay, I understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Family... If he didn't have much feeling towards his family when he was young, then over the years, he seems to be slowly getting used to them, getting used to the feeling of having siblings and parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If a family member is facing difficulties, one would naturally want to help. Is this not what it means to have a sense of responsibility towards one's family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the son's response was very simple, Jason was very satisfied. "Okay, then rest well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jason returned to the room, Grace immediately approached him and asked, "What did you talk about with Mason in his room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We just talked about him and Veronica. Veronica has found someone she likes now, so Mason is probably feeling uncomfortable about it. That's why he came back today," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace was surprised, "What, Veronica has someone she likes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, there's a guy named Daniel in their school who is one grade higher than them," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That Mason..." Grace's face was full of worry. Although she knew that their relationship couldn't be forced, he was still her own son. Besides, she also knew that Mason's feelings for Veronica had already surpassed the usual sibling relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this really blows up, who knows what kind of consequences it will cause!</p></div>
