        <h1>Chapter 1274</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he felt a pang in his heart when she said those words. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all in the past now.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about me... Am I in the past too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head and stared at the man sitting beside her. "It's all in the past to me, so you don't have to dwell on it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He broke into a chuckle. "I don't have to..." His pain, regrets, and remorse were all unnecessary?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car had already stopped at the entrance of the main house, and Brian said, "Get out of the car. I have something to show you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Brian into the main house and they soon arrived at a studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His paintings were in it. They were paintings of... her as a child. The scenes of them in the woods when they were little, her grabbing his hand to prevent him from falling off the cliff at a time of crisis... and her coming down the hill with him on her back...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had painted the scenes in his memory and placed them in this room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was unknown how many paintings there were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said bitterly, "I painted these over the years. I painted every time I missed you. It was as though I could make myself feel better when I painted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, his gaze fell on her. "Grace, I've finally found you after looking for you for so many years. But God seems to enjoy playing tricks on me by letting me miss you again and again. Tell me, if I had asked for your name, address, age, school, class, student ID number... would I have not wasted so many years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also... you're not completely indifferent to me, are you? You visited me every day when I was hospitalized. You cared about my injuries, didn't you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I had met you, helped you find a good doctor for Lina, and gave her the best treatment the night you came to see me, would you... have never married Jason? Would there... have been some kind of possibility between us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared intently at her as if he wanted to hear an answer from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed and said, "There are no ifs in this world. Brian, if I do feel something for you, it's just because I think of you as a friend who has shared adversities with me. I'm thankful that you saved me. It's only natural for me to care about your injuries, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mouth gently spat out the last words, "I've never fallen for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she knew it was cruel for her to tell him such a thing, she still wanted to tell him. She did not want him to continue putting his feelings on her and did not want his future to be filled with regrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was pale and almost colorless. He trembled slightly as if he were standing on the edge of a cliff and her words were sharp weapons. It was as if she could easily knock him down the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So are you trying to tell me that you won't fall for me whether... I miss you or not?" he asked in a mutter.</p></div>
