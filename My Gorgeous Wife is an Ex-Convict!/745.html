        <h1>Chapter 744</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Vicious?" Grace interrupted Sean. "If that's called vicious, then you probably don't know what vicious really is, Mr. Stevens!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The inhuman torture she had suffered in prison had made her think several times that she would not survive. Sean probably had not suffered a tenth of that pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you only be satisfied after ruining her?" Sean asked angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't she try to ruin me too? If I hadn&rsquo;t gotten lucky, my hands wouldn't be able to lift anything now," Grace said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean was shocked, and his gaze fell on Grace's hands by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past few years, his mind would recall that scene every now and then. When that happened, he would feel a surge of mixed feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially after learning that Grace was wronged, he wondered if he and she would have stayed together if she had not been wronged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he would always put a stop to the idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily was the best for him. Lily was the best choice for him and the Stevens family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, now that you have Jason, why bother being so ruthless with Lily?" Sean softened his tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sneered and looked at Sean with nothing but disgust in her almond-shaped eyes. "Mr. Stevens, I'm afraid you don't know what it means to be ruthless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lily is now only blacklisted in the entertainment industry, but she&rsquo;s still the second daughter of the Atkinson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She still has her family and you. She has the Atkinson family and the Stevens family as backup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Being ruthless would be having everyone turn their backs on her and have the Atkinson family and the Stevens family reach a dead-end. She would be in pain but can't get help, and she'd rather be dead than alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace spoke, Sean's face grew paler and paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to see me be that ruthless, Mr. Stevens?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean could not utter a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until Grace got in the car and sped off that Sean stumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, there was a surge of fear in his heart that Grace would indeed go ahead and be as ruthless as she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was dating him, she was confident, energetic, and gentle. Whenever he asked for something, she always tried her best to do it well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... What was left was cold and disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe she was giving another man her gentleness and energy, a man... He simply could not afford to offend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean could only feel a sense of loss in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why... Did he feel this way when Lily was a better fit for him than Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart seemed to be throbbing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it for Lily? Or is it for Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or is it for what Grace called &lsquo;ruthlessness&rsquo;, which is something that Grace herself has experienced&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean did not want to think about it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver drove Grace back to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the way, Grace sent a message asking Jason if it was true that Lily had been blacklisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect Jason to answer right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only three seconds later, he replied with a message, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p></div>
