        <h1>Chapter 1534</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't know how I fell in love with you back then, but what makes you think I'll fall in love with you now?" His voice unconsciously rose as if to hide the awkwardness he felt at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one, who had been asleep on his shoulder, was awakened by his raised voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper half-opened her eyes in a daze. "Daddy, I still want to sleep. Don't make any noise!" The little one kissed Jason on the cheek again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stiffened once again and looked somewhat awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, Jasper. I'll take you to sleep in another room. Daddy has to work," said Grace after taking two steps forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one said, "Okay.&rdquo; She obediently stretched out her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace took her daughter from Jason's arms. The little one leaned against Grace's shoulder and went back to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason only found his arms suddenly feeling empty. He had wanted the little one to be taken away as soon as possible, but he felt a sense of loss after she was taken away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What was wrong with him today? Why did he keep having such strange feelings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All these strange feelings were caused by the mother and daughter before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll go out first. I'll leave you to your work," said Grace as she lowered her voice, not wanting to wake her daughter again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when she turned around, she paused and turned to look at him. "By the way, Jay, I'm still your wife. Since I'm not dead, we're still married. It's only natural that I want you to fall in love with me, isn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She left the study with her daughter in her arms without waiting for him to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips tightly together and glared at the door that opened and closed. 'Natural? A woman who left me five years ago is now talking about it being natural.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But... why do I feel... glad to hear her say that? This joy is beyond comprehension!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He raised his hand and pressed it against his heart, which was still beating fast as if he was in high spirits and feeling content. How long had he not felt this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Was it... all because of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Was it because of her appearance?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He gently looked down. With his head hung low, he looked at his hands. He had forgotten her, but... it was as if his body still remembered her. He even had a variety of different reactions when he was in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, why did you leave and come back? Do you really... want me to love you?" he murmured, only to be answered by the silent air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace saw her son, Mick Reed, in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Of course, there was a time when she thought her son and daughter would look similar. After all, they were triplets! However, she realized that the two children looked very different after seeing her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her son was the spitting image of Jason! Grace still remembered seeing pictures of Jason when he was a child. He looked almost the same as his son now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would look like his father when he grew up, and he would probably charm a lot of Emerald City's socialites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you my mommy?" These were Mick Reed&rsquo;s first words upon meeting Grace. Grace almost choked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had prepared a lot of lines, but now she did not need them at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How do you know?" she asked in surprise. She had not even introduced herself.</p></div>
