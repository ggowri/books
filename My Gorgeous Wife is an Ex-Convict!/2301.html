        <h1>Chapter 2299</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze. Those beautiful peach blossom eyes were so beautiful as they sparkled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips opened and closed. His warm breath spread on her face, making her delirious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingertips glided over her eyes with an irresistible charm. It was as if he had thrown a pebble into her heart, creating ripples.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I won&rsquo;t leave." Her red lips parted slightly as she uttered the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she leave him when he loved her so much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words sounded like the sweetest music to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not help leaning over and kissing her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, do you know how much I love you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know, Jay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was so in love with her, so she was willing to let go of all the rights and wrongs, build a family with him, and spend the rest of her life with him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Emerald City&rsquo;s prison, Secretary Wang looked at the person who appeared in front of him with a flicker of surprise in his eyes. He chuckled. "I didn't expect you to visit me in prison one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never thought I'd visit you one day either," Martin Weiss said slowly. He wore a crisp suit, but his slightly pale face made his cold and solemn face sickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Secretary Wang said, "I wonder what&rsquo;s the reason for your visit today, Mr. Weiss? We didn&rsquo;t have much to do with each other before, and now that I'm in prison, I don't think I can help you much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came to see you because you can help me," Martin Weiss said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh? Pray tell," said Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As far as I know, you tampered with Jason's memory in the past, didn&rsquo;t you? You hypnotized him and made him forget his feelings for Grace. You even... altered certain memories, replacing real ones with false ones," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Secretary Wang was shocked. Many people knew Jason had lost his memory, but only a few people should know about the replacement of real memory with false memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Kyla... Grace's best friend had no idea, but Martin Weiss did!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you after?" asked Secretary Wang as his face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Don't worry. I'm here to make you a deal. I want to know who you asked to hypnotize Jason. Then I want to know how to find this person. And in return, I can find a way to make your life better in prison, or I can help you finish any unfinished business as long as it's not against reason and nature."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Secretary Wang stared at Martin Weiss as if examining the truth of what he said. After some time, he said, "Then I would like to know whom you are going to hypnotize and have their memory altered after finding the hypnotist?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss coldly spat out a word. "Myself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half an hour later, Martin Weiss walked out of the prison and got into a black car waiting outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Drive. Head to the airport," Martin Weiss instructed the driver in the front in a cold voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the driver replied, and the car headed in the direction of Emerald City Airport.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes looked out of the window at the scenery that kept going backward... Emerald City... He would probably never come back again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would probably not see Kyla even if he set foot in this city again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla...' The very thought of the name made his heart ache.</p></div>
