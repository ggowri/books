        <h1>Chapter 3333</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On their way back, Jason and Grace brought up the Abbott family once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will expand the search range beyond Emerald City. The person who took Lawrence has not been found yet. If we can find that person, we should be able to locate Lawrence's whereabouts."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Has the police found any leads?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are some leads, but they are few. With just these leads, it's not enough to find the person," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace sighed, "The Abbott family's situation is also my responsibility. I knew Wilona had a gambling problem, but I didn't really help her quit. As a result, she went to borrow from loan sharks and ended up like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is her own problem, not yours. You don't need to feel guilty about it. It's like someone wants to use a kitchen knife to harm others. Should we blame the seller of the knife?" Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although that's what you say, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace, this is Wilona's own choice, not someone else's forcing her. She chose this path herself. If you feel guilty about it, how many things in life will you feel guilty about? Maybe in the future, you will be afraid to do anything, even to be kind to others, for fear that they will become greedy like Wilona. Isn't that right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We helped the Abbott family, but whether they choose to do good or bad with our help is their own choice. Since they made their choice, they should bear the consequences themselves," Jason comforted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand. I won't dwell on it," Grace said. "By the way, is Philip and William coming to Emerald City tomorrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, tomorrow. They will be staying for about a week this time. I have arranged a hotel for them," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William has arrived, and Jasper's mood might improve a bit." Over the years, the relationship between the two children has been deepening. Since their own two sons couldn't help Jasper let go of Lawrence's matter, perhaps William could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, William arrived at the Reed family's place as soon as he got off the plane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William." As soon as Jasper saw William, he rushed forward and hugged him tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For her, two friends are very important: Lawrence and William. Lawrence is currently missing, and she suddenly feels afraid that one day William might also go missing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't want to lose any more friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William hugged Jasper and said, "Sorry for coming to see you so late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After learning about Lawrence's accident, he immediately wondered how she was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Deer Capital and Emerald City are so far away, and he couldn't come by himself. So he could only comfort her through video calls and then ask his father to bring him to Emerald City.</p></div>
