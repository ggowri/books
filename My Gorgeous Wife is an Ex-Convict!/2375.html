        <h1>Chapter 2373</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know where Amber Mitchell is. I can... text you her whereabouts after boarding the plane and before the plane takes off. If you don&rsquo;t get a text message from me, the Reed family would still be able to find a way to stop the plane from taking off," said Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at Jacqueline Bowman and pondered slightly before saying, "Alright. I hope you won&rsquo;t go back on your word."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course." Jacqueline Bowman smiled again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">30 million U.S. dollars was soon transferred to Jacqueline Bowman's account, and they had already booked the flight for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she was not allowed to leave the country during her probation period, Jacqueline Bowman thought the Reed family would have a way to help her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman toyed with her phone as she enjoyed Grace and Kyla's escort at the airport. When Jacqueline Bowman boarded the plane, she smiled at Kyla and said, "Amber Mitchell probably isn&rsquo;t expecting someone to save her from hell. Kyla, it's kind of you to do so much for Amber Mitchell. But I owe Amber Mitchell my life too for being able to be safe and live a good life abroad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman said as she walked into the departure hall and left readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked to Kylaand whispered, "Don't worry. She'll only be disappointed at the end of the day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I know that. I'm just wondering what kind of hell Amber Mitchell is living in right now," said Kyla, her face full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll find out soon if she really knows where Amber Mitchell is," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The plane door closed. When the flight attendants reminded passengers to turn off their phones as the plane was about to take off, Jacqueline Bowman lazily typed a single line on her phone and sent a short message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the plane began to take off. Jacqueline Bowman was finally relieved and smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">30 million U.S. dollars was enough for her to live a good life abroad! The message she sent was not Amber Mitchell's whereabouts at all. It was just an address she made up at random.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla searched that place, she would find that Amber Mitchell was not there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Kyla cared about Amber Mitchell, the less she wanted to do whatever she wanted and tell her Amber Mitchell's actual whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Amber Mitchell should continue to suffer, and Kyla should live in guilt forever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Meanwhile, I, Jacqueline Bowman, can go abroad to live a happy life! How amazing!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Jacqueline Bowman thought about it, the happier she became. Looking at the time, she still had five hours before arriving at her destination. Hence, she asked for a blanket and decided to take a nap first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time had passed, Jacqueline Bowman gradually woke up and heard an announcement over the loudspeaker that the plane was about to land.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I finally here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My new life is about to begin!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman almost could not wait for the plane to land!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that when the plane landed and she stepped out of the aircraft, she was dumbfounded. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The airport in front of her was so familiar.</p></div>
