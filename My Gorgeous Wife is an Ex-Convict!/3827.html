        <h1>Chapter 3825</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love you, whether or not you want to be with me in the end. I don't want you to deny my feelings for you," Veronica said. "Mason, I truly love you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Daniel? Didn't you love him too? If his family didn't have problems and he didn't break up with you to get the money to save his father, would you still be in love with him?" Mason suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I didn't love Daniel that much from the beginning!" Veronica said. "At first, I had a crush on him, but later, maybe I sensed your feelings for me and wanted to avoid breaking our sibling-like relationship, so I chose to be with Daniel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It can be said that she was the one who made the wrong choice from the beginning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had taken her feelings more seriously and not made a hasty decision, perhaps all the tragedies would not have happened!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, from the beginning, you were not my top priority in terms of my feelings, and in the future, you may not be either," Mason said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a long future ahead of us. How can you say that in the future, I won't put my feelings for you first, when you haven't experienced the future yourself?" Veronica looked at his face, which was so close to hers. "Mason, if I can disobey you and escape alone when we're in danger, it means that I love you enough to risk my life for you. How can you say that I don't put my feelings for you first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pupils suddenly shrank, as if he was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "So now, I put loving you first. No one can predict the future, but I want to be with you in the future, to see the scenery together, and to witness whether my feelings for you are still my top priority."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyelashes trembled slightly, and even his lips trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he finally said, "If you fall in love with someone else in the future, it will be devastating for you, for me, and for the person you love the most. Even so, do you still want to be with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica smiled. She didn't think she would love anyone else in the future except for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the first 20 years of her life, he had the most important place in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the six years they were apart, her feelings for him grew stronger every day. She gradually realized how much she loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when he suggested "trying to date," she couldn't wait to seize the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she didn't want to miss him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that day really comes, no matter what the result is, I am willing to bear it!" Veronica said. "Mason, let's be together again. After experiencing life and death situations like this, do we still need to be apart? Can't you see how much I love you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A complex light flashed in his black eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, every word she said was like the most tempting lure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... once they were really together, would he experience that uneasiness and anxiety again, and would those negative emotions consume him again?</span></p></div>
