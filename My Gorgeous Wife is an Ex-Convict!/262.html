        <h1>Chapter 261</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the trio ordered their coffee, Andrea purposely started a conversation about Grace's current job in an attempt to hear more about Grace's current plight and to observe Jason's reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason looked unperturbed. It was as if Grace's answer, which he already knew, could not surprise him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, why don't I talk to the boss at the firm? Then you can go back and get a job at the firm. Even if you're only working as a cleaner at the firm, it&rsquo;s better than being a sanitation service worker," Andrea said, pretending to be nice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up at Andrea, but her eyes grew colder and colder. "I have no intention of changing my job."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Andrea curled her lips. "You&rsquo;ll probably earn more being a cleaner at the firm than a sanitation service worker. Are you sure you don't want to think about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think I know exactly what I'm going to do." Grace's tone got colder too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea wanted to say more, but Tyler Barber stopped her. Fortunately, the waiter came to serve their coffee, and the topic was temporarily brought to a halt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here. The coffee is expensive. It tastes better when it's hot," Andrea said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lifted the coffee gracefully, sniffed the aroma, and took a sip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea looked at the man in front of her and felt that he was just like those idols and celebrities. The mere scene of him drinking coffee was pleasing to the eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed, how did you meet Grace?" Andrea asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When it snowed, she took the initiative to talk to me. That's how we met," Jason said, smiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Huh? Just like that?! That seemed a bit too easy! "Grace pursued you, then?" Andrea said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glanced at Grace who was sipping milk tea with her head down. "I guess so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost spat her milk tea out! When did she do that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at this point, it was clear that Andrea had misunderstood her relationship with Jason, so Grace did not bother to explain. It was up to Jason to say whatever he wanted. It did not matter if Andrea misunderstood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then Grace is lucky to pursue such a handsome guy. How long have you known Grace?" Andrea continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A few months, I guess?" Jason rarely had the patience to answer these sorts of questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In that case..." Andrea looked at Grace and said seemingly without much thought, "Ever since Grace got out of prison, I've been hoping that she can find someone to rely on. After all, her previous prison experience was too devastating for her. Now that she has a boyfriend like Mr. Reed, it's really..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea suddenly stopped in the middle of her sentence. She saw Jason looking at her with a half-smile as if he was aware of all her ideas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea felt as if the rest of the words were stuck in her throat. She could no longer go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you go on? It's really what?" Jason asked, raising his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea looked embarrassed and lamely said, "Really... really generous. After all, Grace has been in prison, and a lot of men mind if a woman has been to prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't mind," Jason said. He then looked indulgently at Grace. "No matter her past, I only want her to stay with me willingly."</p></div>
