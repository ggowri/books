        <h1>Chapter 1993</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow stared at his son. Moments later, he said slowly, "In that case, I won't force you. But you'll want to go back to Deer City and the Barlow family sooner or later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William pressed his tiny lips tightly together, still staying silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow pulled out a piece of paper and wrote a phone number on it. "If you ever want to follow me back to Deer City, call me. Remember my words, you'll have everything you want in Deer City. In Emerald City, you'll always be the son of a penniless criminal who relies on someone else's charity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy&rsquo;s body became stiffer and stiffer while one of his small hands clenched the small note with the number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow said nothing else and turned to walk out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Soon, a kindergarten teacher walked in and took William back to the classroom. They made him lie down on his nap bed as if nothing had happened. Only the note in William's tiny hand reminded him of what had just happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Philip Barlow walked out of the kindergarten, he saw another car parked next to his. A figure came down from it. It was Jason, the toughest man in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Surprise flashed through Philip Barlow's eyes, and then realization dawned upon him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Well, William now lived in the Reed family&rsquo;s house. Although he was careful not to alarm anyone when he investigated William, Jason was not an ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Barlow. But we never had a chance to meet. I didn't expect to see you here. I wonder what you're doing at this kindergarten. Does the Barlow family have children in this kindergarten too?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as Philip Barlow said this, he knew that Jason probably already knew about everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, he stopped pretending. "But I do have a son here. Thank you for taking care of my son William all this while, Mr. Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two men looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Taking care of him is nothing. My daughter is fond of William, but I wonder what you have to do with Lily, Mr. Barlow. Now that Lily has died in prison, what are you doing in Emerald City, Mr. Barlow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason was straightforward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow was indeed not someone to be looked down upon, and Lily had brought her death upon herself. However, it did have something to do with the Reed family and Grace. If Philip Barlow failed to distinguish right from wrong and wanted to get revenge for Lily, it would probably cause a lot of trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Smart people like Philip Barlow knew what Jason meant. "I only came to Emerald City to take William away. As for Lily, I'll stay out of her feud with the Reed family. Besides, she's dead now. I don't have to do anything for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He spoke ruthlessly. Philip Barlow did not even remember the face of the woman he once had a fling with, and most of his impression of her was based on his investigations afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was not that stupid to make himself an enemy of the Reed family for a dead woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moreover, he had no feelings for Lily. He might not even have investigated that night so many years ago and wondered if he had a child had it not been impossible for him to have children now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it was surprising that a woman like Lily would give birth to the child. That was considered to be the one good thing Lily had done. </p></div>
