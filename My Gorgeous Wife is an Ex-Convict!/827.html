        <h1>Chapter 826</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I won't switch my job for the time being. I'll do it when I've made some real achievements and have a better resume," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you mind how those people treat you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I do, but... that's also the frustration of being an adult. Even though I don't get along with those people, I still have to stay for the sake of earning a living. As for them... Um, it was the second daughter of the Atkinson family, Lily, who wanted to embarrass me. If they helped me, they would be offending Lily. We're not that close, so they have no reason to do that for me, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was somewhat surprised. He did not expect her to be so understanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after saying that, she froze and looked at him strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like that?" he asked with a slight frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips together for a long time before she said, "Nothing... I'm hungry and I want something to eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright." Hadwin smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since it was not dinner time, Hadwin took Lina to a dessert shop that was pretty popular these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He ordered the dessert he was interested in, but Lina was a little absent-minded. She kept looking at Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He naturally felt that something was wrong with her, but... it felt good when she looked at him that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why do you keep looking at me today?" Hadwin asked with a smile on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina bit her lip. Everyone in this world knew how to seek benefits and avoid harm. She understood that her colleagues and director were afraid of offending Lily, so they dared not intervene in her affairs with that woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she had a conflict with Jason, Hadwin did not hesitate to intervene and took on all the responsibilities for her. Someone like him should know that once he intervened, he would offend Jason by doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he chose to stand by her side and was willing to be the sword in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it really... fake? What if it's true?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin, do you really like me?" Lina asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin suddenly narrowed his eyes. There was a flash of surprise in his eyes. He could feel that she was being unprecedentedly serious right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips parted as he said gently, "Yes." The simple word had already been declared his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you... still going to get even with me?" Lina took a deep breath before continuing to ask, "Are you going to dump me after I fall in love with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sighed. "If I only wanted to get even with you, why would I do so much for you? Lina, do you really think I've been with you all these days just to get back at you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was speechless. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Regarding the time they had spent together these days... If there was a so-called boyfriend grading system, even if he did not get a full score, he certainly had a high score.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes she could not help but think that if she could find a boyfriend who would treat her as well as he did, then she would be really happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He made her know what it was like to be so carefully cherished by a man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin, I think I like you. If you want, then... How about a real relationship? Not one that&rsquo;s on the premise of revenge, but let&rsquo;s become a real couple?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, this was the first time she was confessing to a man so seriously.</p></div>
