        <h1>Chapter 1775</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"And cough up all the money you received to raise him. Pay one cent less and you'll see what the consequences are." Jason left with Grace as soon as he finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Archer Barlow and Rosalind Bush looked dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They had wanted to get credit from them, but now they had to cough up all the money they previously received. How could they accept this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace and Jason returned to Reed Residence, they heard Uncle Kwan say, "Little Young Lady refuses to let the child be taken away no matter what. She found a pair of handcuffs and handcuffed the child's hand to hers. She flushed the key down the toilet!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The child?" Grace was stunned. "Who?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lily's son." It was Jason who answered her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Lily's son?' Grace immediately realized it was the little boy at the exhibition who played the piano very well, but&hellip; &ldquo;Why is he with Jasper? And in the Reed family house?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"When you were trying to save Mason, Jasper sneaked out of the house and somehow ran into Lily's son. When the people looking after Jasper found her, she insisted on bringing the child back with her." However, even Jason did not expect his daughter to be so persistent in keeping that little boy by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Where did she get the handcuffs?" Jason frowned and asked Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's... the toy handcuffs Little Young Lady uses to play cops and robbers," said Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Anyone can pick the lock for toy handcuffs," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Uncle Kwan gave a wry smile. "The toy is a global limited edition. The lock and key were custom-made... They're also limited-editions. Unless the factory sends us the key, regular locksmiths will have a hard time unlocking it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's face darkened immediately. 'Is my daughter going to be handcuffed to a boy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But I've had someone call the factory. They'll send the key over as soon as possible. It should take two days... for the key to be delivered."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">While he was speaking, Jasper Reed's young voice suddenly rang out. "Daddy, Mommy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked up and saw her daughter's tiny figure coming down the stairs, followed by the boy named William, as well as Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The three children went down the stairs. Jasper ran to Grace, dragging William with her. However, she was dumbfounded when she saw Grace's hands that were covered with white gauze. "Mommy, your hands..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... hurt my hands, so I have to stay in the hospital for the next few days. Jasper and Mick, be good, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed stared at Grace's hands with a solemn expression on his little face. "Mommy, are your hands badly hurt?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace smiled and said, "It&rsquo;s only a minor injury. Don't worry, Mick. I have the best doctors treating me. I&rsquo;ll be back in a few days, and then I can hold you both again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The solemn look on Mick Reed's face finally faded a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper was greatly relieved. Since her mother had the best doctors treating her, then she would be all right! Doctors could cure patients!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, when can we see Mason? Also, is Mason my older brother or younger brother?" asked Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had no idea whether he was her older brother or younger brother. She could only let the children solve that themselves.</p></div>
