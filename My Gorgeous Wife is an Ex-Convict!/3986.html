        <h1>Chapter 3984</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked at the dagger on the coffee table and couldn't help but bite her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just cutting off a finger, this punishment was much lighter than she had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She should be grateful that the other party only wanted one of her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she really lost one finger, it wouldn't cause any inconvenience to her future life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Can't bear to lose a finger?" Perhaps she had been silent for too long, Jason spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I just wanted to say... thank you," Nancy said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One finger to redeem her sin, to exchange for the Reed family's forgiveness, she had actually gained something from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha... you really are an interesting kid. It's rare to hear someone say thank you to the person who wants to take their finger," Jason laughed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy took a deep breath and grabbed some tissues from the box next to her, in case blood splattered when she cut off her finger. She then picked up the knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bent four of the fingers on her left hand and pressed them onto the tissues, leaving her little finger extended. As she was about to swing the knife towards her little finger, the office door suddenly burst open, causing her to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar voice echoed through the office. Nancy looked up to see Mick walking towards her, his gaze fixed on the knife in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, she felt a sharp pain in her wrist and the knife was no longer in her hand, but in Mick's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you have a knife? What's going on?" Mick stared at Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone hadn't told him that his father was meeting Nancy in the office, he would have been too late...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the moment when she raised the knife, his heart suddenly felt like it was going to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing, just wanted her to cut off a finger!" Jason said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut off a finger?" Mick narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut off a finger. After that, she and you will be even, and the Reed family won't bother her anymore." Jason said, "Miss Fowler also agreed to this plan, so we were about to do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's face darkened as he glared at Nancy. "Are you really planning to cut off your finger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just one finger. I did something I shouldn't have done to you, so this punishment is deserved." She said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you owe me, the punishment you receive should be decided by me, not my father!" Mick said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's eyelashes trembled slightly as she looked up at him. "Then what kind of punishment do you want me to receive? You tell me, and I'll do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to ask for his forgiveness, or perhaps it would be better to say that she was willing to accept punishment, so as not to be overwhelmed by the endless guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, every night when it was quiet, she would think of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in her dreams, she would dream of every little detail of their time together, and when she woke up, her face was always covered in tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick looked at the woman in front of him, with a resigned look on her face, just like that night in the private room when she was forced to endure the client's teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This resigned look made him angry!</span></p></div>
