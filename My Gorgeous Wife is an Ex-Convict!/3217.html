        <h1>Chapter 3215</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mommy and Daddy are looking forward to it very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he was afraid. His piano skills were self-taught in secret, and he only knew a few pieces. If he didn't play well and couldn't win Miss. Reed's favor, what would he do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper slightly furrowed her eyebrows. She had promised her mother that she wouldn't be a bully. So, if Lawrence really didn't want to play the piano for her, she suggested, "How about we exchange? I'll play a song for you to listen to, and you can play one for me too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence was taken aback, clearly not expecting the other party to propose such an exchange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What kind of music will she play on the piano? He suddenly became curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it good?" Her beautiful almond eyes looked at him with strong anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A good" word, was spoken from his mouth just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper immediately became excited and turned to Grace and Jason, saying, "Mommy, Daddy, Lawrence agreed! He willingly played the piano for me to listen to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing his speech, Jasper took the initiative to walk towards the piano that had already been prepared. He sat down and lifted the piano lid. His slender fingers rested on the keys and he began to play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The beautiful sound of the piano flowed through the room, and Lawrence listened to it in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So it turns out she plays so well, better than anyone else he's ever heard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She already knows how to play like this, does she still need to listen to him play the piano? Suddenly, he felt ashamed of himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Abbott couple were also surprised to see that the little princess of the Reed family played the piano so well. They wondered if their own son's piano skills would impress the other party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jasper played the last note, he stood up with a smile and looked at Lawrence expectantly, saying "Okay, it's your turn now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence walked somewhat awkwardly to the piano and sat down, turning his head to look at the bright smile on Jasper's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could feel that the other person really wanted to hear him play the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why though? He didn't play the piano very well, and other kids his age who were also learning to play said he played poorly and wasn't smooth at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Turning back, he looked at the black and white keys in front of him, took a deep breath, and began playing on the keys with his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was playing the same Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige that Jasper had heard him play the other day. The piano notes were a bit rough in some places, giving off a sense of awkwardness and lack of smoothness, but Jasper was still listening with great interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Grace doesn't play the piano, she has listened to many masters play over the years. Her daughter also practices the piano almost every day at home, so she can naturally tell whether the performance is good or bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Lawrence's playing may be a bit rough, his sense of pitch is excellent, just as Jasper said, he has a certain "charm". In this world, there are many people who play the piano well, but there are not many who can play with charm. It's no wonder Jasper has been eager to find Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the song ended, Lawrence looked nervous while Jasper's eyes shone even brighter. He happily grabbed Lawrence's hand and exclaimed, "Wow, you played so beautifully! I love your piano playing!"</p></div>
