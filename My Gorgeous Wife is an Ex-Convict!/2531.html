        <h1>Chapter 2529</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's face darkened. "What's the matter? Are you unhappy to see Louise Mitchell acquitted, so you're finding ways to get Louise Mitchell back in jail? The police have already ruled the car crash as an accident. Louise Mitchell is still the Gregory family's daughter-in-law. Do you know what your reckless behavior will do to the Gregory family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is all you care about is the effects on the Gregory family?&rdquo; Amber Mitchell snapped. 'Am I disappointed? What&rsquo;s there to be disappointed about? I should have known that George Gregory is such a person.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm only asking if you have to go through so much trouble? You can't afford the consequences if you involve the Gregory family in this," warned George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell replied without backing down, "Is there anything I can't afford? At worst, I just have to give up my life! But what about you? Speaking of which, Herman was friends with you. He died for no apparent reason, but you're now warning me not to find out the truth about his death. George Gregory, is this how you treat your friends?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Herman Moss is no longer my friend. If he was my friend, he wouldn't have gone behind my back and hooked up with you. How dare you say that now?" George Gregory said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He has never done you wrong. You're the one who's been doubting him and me. If he had wanted to do you wrong, he wouldn't have come to say goodbye to me before going abroad!" Amber Mitchell said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not care about being wronged and misunderstood, but she did not want Herman to keep carrying that burden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was such a nice person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory did not believe her explanations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Either way, you'd better drop this case immediately. Or..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said indifferently, "I can't. It&rsquo;s already a criminal case. Louise Mitchell deliberately plotted the accident and killed Herman. Even though all these years have passed, she&rsquo;ll still have to pay for her crime! With the current evidence, you can't get her out of this even if you wish to help her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory stared at Amber Mitchell. "There's nothing I can&rsquo;t do in Deer City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Gregory family doesn't rule Deer City." Another voice rang. Daley Moss had also come to the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss looked coldly at George Gregory. "If Mrs. Gregory is responsible for my eldest brother's death and the Gregory family plans to protect her, the Moss family won&rsquo;t be willing to take things lying down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory looked intently at Daley Moss. "Okay, I have my eye on you, the Moss family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, George Gregory turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss looked at Amber Mitchell. "What did he tell you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. He just asked me to drop the case because he doesn&rsquo;t want Louise Mitchell's case to affect the Gregory family. He must be unaware of what happened back then," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss said, "If he&rsquo;s really unaware, once everything is cleared up, are you going to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;ll never happen between him and me," replied Amber Mitchell as she looked solemnly at Daley Moss after a moment of contemplation. "Mr. Moss, I have a request. When everything is cleared up, I&rsquo;d like to do something for Herman..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Amber Mitchell uttered something that Daley Moss found unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I couldn't give Herman anything when he was alive. Now that he's dead, it's the only thing I can give him. Mr. Moss, I'm not asking for any money. I can also sign an agreement, and you can set the terms. I just want to repay Herman's affection," Amber Mitchell said sincerely. Her eyes were full of tears for Herman Moss.</p></div>
