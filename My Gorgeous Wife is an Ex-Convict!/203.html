        <h1>Chapter 202</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she not anxious to no longer have any ties with Jason? After all, his existence to the previous her was like a nightmare. However, just now&hellip; She had actually thought about him saving her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why were you at the hospital?&rdquo; Brian&rsquo;s voice abruptly sounded in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;My maternal grandmother is sick. I came to visit her,&rdquo; she said. Even if she did not say it, he could find out with a discreet check.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Your grandmother lives in this town?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then, you&hellip;. lived here in the past too?&rdquo; His voice seemed to carry some hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I lived here for some time when I was little, but I went back to Emerald City after becoming a little older,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is that so? Then when you stayed here when you were little, did anything unusual happen?&rdquo; When he asked this, his fingers that were holding the steering wheel tightened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean by &lsquo;something unusual&rsquo;,&rdquo; Grace replied. &ldquo;Moreover, when I was here, I was still little. Even if something unusual had happened, I wouldn&rsquo;t know or would&rsquo;ve forgotten about it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stayed silent and did not say anything else. The car stopped outside the entrance to a restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The second Grace saw this restaurant, she recognized it as the well-known hole-in-the-wall restaurant in town. A majority of those who came here to eat were usually locals. Outsiders very rarely came here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This town was not a tourist attraction either. This kind of hole-in-the-wall restaurant would naturally not be as developed as a place in the tourism industry that would have many outsiders checking in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had stayed here a good few years when she was little too. Only those who were very familiar with the area would know it. After all, this hole-in-the-wall restaurant had been open for many years. Back when she lived in her maternal grandmother&rsquo;s house, this restaurant was already here. Her grandmother even brought her here often to sate their cravings and whatnot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little surprised. She never thought that Brian would actually know this place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;The dishes here aren&rsquo;t bad. It&rsquo;s just that the place is a little crude,&rdquo; Brian said after he got out of the car. &ldquo;Speaking of which, you stayed here for some time before. Have you eaten here?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Do you like the food here?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. The quality for its price is pretty high, and some of their dishes are quite unique.&rdquo; Actually, she quite liked this restaurant&rsquo;s dishes. However, to someone like Brian who was used to eating various intricate delicacies, these dishes were too unworthy of being served in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Grace did not expect was that when Brian walked into the restaurant, the boss would take the initiative to greet him. &ldquo;Master Hart, you&rsquo;ve come again. Every year, I always know that you&rsquo;ll come over around this time. And this is&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boss&rsquo;s gaze moved to Grace. Although Grace had come here often when she was little, her visits were more irregular in the past ten years. She would only come here when she visited her grandmother. It was only normal for the boss not to remember her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Haha, it&rsquo;s rare to see you bringing friends over. Is it still the usual today, then?&rdquo; the boss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;A few dishes more than usual. I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you.&rdquo; As Brian said this, he brought Grace along to find a table. They sat at a place near the windows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat down too, thinking of the earlier introduction Brian gave earlier. She and he could not be considered friends at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Every year, around this time, I will come and have a meal here,&rdquo; Brian said. &ldquo;Just like how on this day every year, I&rsquo;ll go to that hospital and stay there awhile.&rdquo;</p></div>
