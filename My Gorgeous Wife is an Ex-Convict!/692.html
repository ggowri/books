        <h1>Chapter 691</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the photos on his phone. They were all photos of Brian pulling Grace into a car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although they had just been posted online, it was already a hot topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many were even speculating about the relationship between Grace and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence looked fearfully at his boss who was staring darkly at the phone in his hand. Then, he finally mustered the courage to say lamely, "Well... Mr. Hart had appeared too quickly. The bodyguards who were in charge of secretly protecting Miss Cummins didn't even have the chance to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His bright eyes just stared at the photo on the phone while his fingers tightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get rid of these. I don't want to see them online anymore," Jason ordered coldly after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Terrence hastily replied and got out of the president's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the quiet room, Jason's finger gently caressed Grace's figure on the phone screen. Finally, it landed on the spot where Brian was holding Grace's wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was leading her forward. The scene looked like a painting he had seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He still remembered that when he was a child, he accidentally entered Brian's studio and saw the paintings Brian painted. Those paintings all consisted of a little girl and a little boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was one where the little girl walked with the little boy in the dense forest, leading him by the hand. There was also one where she carried him on her back. These paintings were like Brian's treasures. He would not even allow a second look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the painting, the little girl was holding the little boy's hand as they walked forward. In this photo, Brian walked forward while holding Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like history repeating itself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or is the bond between these two really inextricable? &hellip; Even if they&rsquo;ve missed each other again and again? Even if they don&rsquo;t know about it? Would fate still bring the two of them together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No! By hook or by crook, I will never let that happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace can only be mine and will only be mine!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes flickered with ruthlessness and determination!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace returned to Reed Residence, she almost jumped out of her skin as soon as she walked into her bedroom and switched on the lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was sitting on the couch in her bedroom, looking at her with those beautiful eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you switch on the lights?" The bedroom curtains were drawn now, so the room was dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was thinking about something." Jason smiled, stood up, and walked slowly over to Grace. He took the two law books she was holding from her hand and asked, "Did you buy them today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. I'm going to brush up on my knowledge and also learn about the latest laws and case studies," said Grace. In particular, local laws would change almost every year, so even lawyers needed to constantly absorb the latest content.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are these all you bought today?" Jason's voice became even softer.</p></div>
