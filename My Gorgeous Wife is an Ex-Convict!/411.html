        <h1>Chapter 410</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you turn on the lights?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I miss you," he said, giving an irrelevant answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face suddenly turned red, and her heart seemed to be beating fast. Just then, Grace was glad that it was still dark as it meant that he could not see her blush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about you? Did you miss me today?" His voice continued to ring in her ears while his breath sprinkled her neck with a tingling sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if all her attention were on her neck, and after feeling his breath, she had a feeling that his lips were so close to her ears that if he came a little closer, his lips would kiss her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when she was a little lost in thought, a slight pain suddenly came over her ears. She felt a shock before coming to herself. Then&hellip; her face turned even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He&hellip; was biting her ear, putting her earlobe in his mouth and making her whole body tremble slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you?" His low voice once again rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I did..." she replied, almost quivering. "Well... Let me go first. I want to put my bag down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, breathing unsteadily. She only felt that the atmosphere was so ambiguous that she could hardly breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, instead of letting go, he went further and asked, "Do you love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned. Love&hellip; was too deep. Did she &lsquo;love&rsquo; him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... like you," Grace said truthfully, taking a deep breath. Yes, she only liked him. Her feelings for him now were not yet &lsquo;love&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Love was sacred and unique to her. It could not be obtained easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to force herself to tell him she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps, though, this answer was not what he had in mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace expected Jason to be unhappy after hearing her answer. She thought he would insist that she change her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strangely enough, he just held her and muttered, "But&hellip; I love you, Sis. I love you so much that I won't know what to do if I ever lose you one day. I love you so much that there will be no meaning in this life if I don't spend it with you. I love you so much that... I can't control my emotions..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was like music in the night wind, seeping into her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze. She was in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was he talking about? He said... he loved her, and he already loved her that much?! How was that possible?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Subconsciously, she wanted to deny it, thinking his words might just be some sweet nothings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, another voice in her heart argued with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People like him did not bother to sweet talk, and neither did he have to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was showing her all his feelings without the slightest concealment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to think that even if he told her he &lsquo;loved&rsquo; her, that love was only affection. She did not expect his &lsquo;love&rsquo; to be deep or strong, but now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not asking you to fall in love with me at once, and I'm not asking you to open your heart to me immediately. I only want your affection for me to be as much as the tenth of my love for you. I only want you to like me a little more," he muttered.</p></div>
