        <h1>Chapter 3342</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Jasper said. She just really wanted to listen to William's music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So William began to play, and he played a familiar tune called "F&uuml;r Elise," which was also one of Jasper's favorite pieces to listen to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper listened quietly, even though they were separated by a phone screen and distance, the piano sound still surrounded her ears so clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the sound of William's piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the song ended, Jasper suddenly asked, "William, do you think there will come a day when I won't be able to hear your music anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was taken aback and asked, "Why do you ask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm afraid that maybe someday, you'll disappear like Lawrence and I won't be able to find you," she said. Then she seemed to realize that it wasn't appropriate to say that and quickly added, "I...I'm not saying you'll disappear, I...I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hesitating for a moment, she said, "I'm just really afraid that something unexpected might happen, like if we have an argument, or if you stop talking to me, or if..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William interrupted, "There won't be so many 'ifs'!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, I'm not Lawrence," William said, "so I won't argue with you. Even if something happens in the future and you're angry with me, I will actively come to find you and try to make things better between us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if you get angry with me? Will you stop talking to me?" she asked worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Lawrence's incident, her previous carefree and lighthearted attitude seemed to have been covered by a layer of something, making her more anxious and insecure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I won't," William said with absolute certainty, "Jasper, I will never ignore you, never."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? Are you sure?" she seemed somewhat incredulous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I'm sure. I will never ignore you, even if one day I'm really angry with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at the face on her phone screen, and suddenly, the anxiousness in her heart seemed to calm down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, what else do you want to hear?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anything is fine, I want to hear whatever you play," Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, William's fingers once again tapped on the piano keys, producing beautiful notes that flowed out from his fingertips and were so pleasant to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William didn't know how long he played for, until the face on his phone screen was no longer visible. He thought that maybe she had fallen asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then ended the video call and made a phone call to Grace, "Auntie Grace, Jasper has fallen asleep. Can you please cover her with a blanket?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Grace was surprised that her daughter had fallen asleep at home, but William was the one informing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was video chatting with her earlier, but then the video was on but there was no sound, so I thought she must have fallen asleep," William explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, okay, I'll go check on her," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ending the call, William walked out of the piano room and as soon as he reached the living room, he saw that his father was still awake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've been in there for three hours, did you play the piano continuously for three hours?" Philip asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why aren't you sleeping yet?" William asked, avoiding the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My son hasn't slept yet, so as a father, I can't sleep peacefully either," Philip replied. "How are your fingers? They must hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Philip knew his son well. Even if his hands were really hurting, his son probably wouldn't say anything.</p></div>
