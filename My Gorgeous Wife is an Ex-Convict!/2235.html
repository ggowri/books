        <h1>Chapter 2233</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would like to have more children because their family would be more lively that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if it was at the cost of him being in fear for so long, then maybe... one child was enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whatever it is, Hadwin Stephenson really loves you. Lina, you picked the right man," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know, right?" Lina chuckled. "He has done so much for me. I'll treat him well for the rest of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two were speaking when there was suddenly a commotion outside the lounge. Lina frowned. "What's going on outside?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll find out once we get outside," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They walked out of the lounge, only to see a group of people carrying boxes into the banquet hall. They were led by Chandler Hunter, the little boy from the Hunter family. He was accompanied by the middle-aged man called Uncle Andy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in the banquet hall was looking on in curiosity, wondering who the boy might be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people could already recognize that the boxes they brought in were made of superior fragrant rosewood, and the carvings on them were so exquisite that the boxes themselves were almost like works of art. It made people wonder what was inside them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chandler Hunter walked up to Lina and Hadwin Stephenson. He said politely, "Hello, Uncle and Aunt. My father asked me to bring you the betrothal gifts today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your father?" murmured Lina. Speaking of which, she had never seen the child's parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My father said since we've decided on the engagement, we should send over the betrothal gifts, lest it's not deemed official," the little one said matter-of-factly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Uncle Andy came forward and handed Hadwin Stephenson a gift list. "This is the Hunter family's betrothal gift list. The things in the boxes are only part of it. The rest will be delivered to you later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in the banquet hall was immediately in an uproar. 'Betrothal gift list? The things in the boxes are only part of it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who exactly is the Hunter family?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;From the looks of it, they're no ordinary people!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing Hadwin Stephenson accept the gift list without rejecting it, the crowd instantly understood that Tina Stephenson&rsquo;s marriage had already been arranged for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tina Stephenson's future groom would be that little boy wearing a smart little suit!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the families with little boys who had set their sights on Tina Stephenson could not help admitting that the little boy from the Hunter family indeed had good looks. He could defeat most kids his age with his looks alone, not to mention his family background.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not many families present could even afford those boxes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina offered Chandler Hunter and Uncle Andy to have a seat, but Chandler Hunter walked over to Tina Stephenson's cradle to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the party did not matter and Tina Stephenson was what mattered the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never liked attending such events where strangers would surround him and look at him like he was a monkey. However, his father said that many people were after Tina, so he must come and stay by his future wife&rsquo;s side to make sure that he would get her in the future!</p></div>
