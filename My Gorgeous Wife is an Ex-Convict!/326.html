        <h1>Chapter 325</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, instead of obediently returning to his mother's arms as he had done yesterday, he tightened his hold on Grace's legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "Sorry, Nelson's not usually like this. He seems to like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. I like Nelson too," said Grace, picking up the little one as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one did not struggle and was remarkably submissive. He even grinned broadly at Grace after she picked him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile had a trace of timidity and ingratiation that made Grace strangely sad. "Hello, Nelson," said Grace, raising her hand to touch the little one's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little one could not hear her voice at all. He did not know what she was saying. He only looked at her in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at her son and then at Grace. Suddenly, there was a flash of gloom in her eyes. Did Nelson... mistake Grace for that person? Was that why he was so unnaturally close to... If so, it was such a shame... They could never see that person again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you teach me some sign language one day, Kyla? I want to learn to communicate with Nelson," Grace said to Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn came to herself and quickly said, "Sure, of course."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace interacted with the little one for a while, but because she did not know sign language, the interaction was not that smooth. She needed Kyla Corbyn to help with sign language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By noon, Grace started delivering food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She found time to practice riding the electric bike, and it was not too big a problem. The electric bike was like a bicycle. Once you knew how to ride it, even after a few years of not riding, you could still get the hang of it immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Grace was delivering food, she tried to control the speed and drive more slowly to get used to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The small restaurant had more orders for food deliveries at noon, but after half-past one, there were fewer orders for food deliveries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was almost two o'clock before Grace was finally free for lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you tired?" Kyla Corbyn asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm doing just fine," Grace said as she smiled. As far as she was concerned, it was not easy to make money. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just that sometimes the restaurant can get busy, and you can't eat on time," Kyla Corbyn said. Just like Grace, she had to wait until she was free to grab a bite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, how old is Nelson? Doesn&rsquo;t he have to go to kindergarten?" said Grace, looking at the little guy as he ate his fruit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gave a wry smile. "He could have gone to kindergarten this year, but because of his hearing disability, the kindergarten wouldn't take him. Although there are kindergartens that cater to special children, the tuition is expensive, and children like him need cochlear implants. Plus, a parent has to accompany him. With my current condition, there's nothing I can do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson doesn&rsquo;t have a cochlear implant yet?" That was when Grace realized that she had not seen the little one with a cochlear implant in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm saving up for it. Maybe another two or three months and I'll have enough money to get him a cochlear implant," said Kyla Corbyn. It was as if the subject had given her hope again. Her face radiated thick maternal love as she tenderly looked at her son. "Once he gets the cochlear implant, Nelson will be able to hear and learn to speak."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could see that Kyla Corbyn loved Nelson very much. Although she was the owner of a small restaurant, she only wore cheap, old clothes. She did not wear any jewelry, and her hair was always tied up casually.</p></div>
