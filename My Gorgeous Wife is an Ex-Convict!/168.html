        <h1>Chapter 167</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence gently closed the door after Grace walked in.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had brought Grace along not because of her own words, but because his own boss still cared about her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maybe Mr. Reed just wanted Grace to give in. However, Grace looked as if something was bothering her, which could be a perfect stepping stone for Mr. Reed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of this, Terrence couldn't help but feel happy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, in the secretary's office, a secretary came over and asked Terrence curiously, "Terrence, who is the woman that went into the president's office just now?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, judging from the woman's outfit, she didn't seem to be a person who could normally enter the president's office.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Terrence said simply, "Don't ask. You will know when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And before that time came, he was afraid that someone might gossip about it and violate the taboo of Mr. Reed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the office, Grace was a little uneasy as she stood there. She looked at Jason, who was sitting in front of his desk and reading through some documents. She felt that the air seemed to be filled with awkwardness.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Previously, she had refused to stay with him. She had thought that there would no longer be any relationship between them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she hadn't expected that she would come to him so soon. After only a few days, she was standing in front of him once again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the man in front of her was someone she had never been familiar with.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the large office, he was wearing an iron-gray suit. His bangs were combed back, revealing his broad forehead. His long eyebrows were drawn up, and his beautiful peach-blossom-like eyes were half-closed as he stared at the documents in his hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Around the beautiful neckline was the collar of a shirt and navy blue tie.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His slender fingers were holding a black pen. When he held the pen and signed the document, his posture gave her an elegant feeling.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the office, it was terribly quiet until his voice broke the silence.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, are you here just to stare at me like this?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was stunned. It seemed that she hadn't been expecting him to call her "sis" anymore.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This nickname was like mockery for her as if he was laughing at how naive she was. At that time, she had even taken him to her home and asked him to be her younger brother.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I have something to tell you." Grace licked her dry lips.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, go ahead," he replied, but he was still buried in reviewing the documents.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She hesitated for a moment before saying, "Well, I was wondering if you could let my uncle and the others go. Now that they have been locked up for a while, it should be enough of a lesson for them. I want to go to the police station and drop the case, but the lawyer on your side has been handling this case, so... please inform your lawyer about this."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason then slowly raised his head and looked at Grace's face. "I remember that I gave you a choice at the beginning. You said that you didn't want to release them. So, are you going back on your words now?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at her as if he was ridiculing her. She felt that even her breath was being stifled under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a long while, she said, "Well, I want... to let them go."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As if he had heard the funniest joke in the world, he said, "What kind of person do you think I am? Do you think you can order me around? I gave you a chance to make a choice. Since you made your decision before, you will have to accept the consequences now."</p></div>
