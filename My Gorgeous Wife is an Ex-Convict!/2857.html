        <h1>Chapter 2855</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? You'd better hurry up, or else I don't know if I'll last till your wedding," Ferris said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't talk like that. Didn't the doctor say you can be cured if you continue to receive treatments?" Rowena Santiago said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But the treatment costs so much money. Let's forget it. Our family has so little money. It's better to leave what we have to you. I only hate myself for being incompetent and not earning much. I failed to give you a good life and caused Valda to suffer with us." Ferris gave a long sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, persuade your uncle to get treatment," Rowena Santiago shouted to Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Uncle sick?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, Dad has been diagnosed with kidney disease. The doctor said he must be treated in time. If he delays his treatment, he'll probably need a new kidney to survive. But if he goes through treatment, he'll need imported medication for better results. But imported medication is expensive. One treatment plan costs half a million dollars. Our family doesn't have that kind of money," said Wynne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ferris shouted, "It costs so much money. Treatment? After one treatment plan, there's a second one... The treatment fee is a bottomless pit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Valda has money now. Valda's boyfriend is the crown prince. He can easily pay for the hospital bills. Valda, don't you agree?" Rowena Santiago said as she looked at Valda Theller expectantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at her uncle's family and figured out the intention of her uncle's family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They wanted nothing more than money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please show me Uncle's medical records and examination report. I'll ask the doctor for help," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago's expression changed. "Medical records? Ask a doctor? What's the matter? Don't you believe that your uncle is sick?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just trying to find out what's going on with Uncle. If he needs money for treatment, I'll pay for a part of it," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Only a part of it? Valda Theller, you have such a rich boyfriend. How can you only pay for a part of it when my father is sick?" Wynne said, looking upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller retorted, "You know he's your father too, so shouldn't you contribute the most? My boyfriend's money belongs to my boyfriend. He has no obligation to lend me money. You can say you're only 'borrowing' it, but you might never pay it back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Wynne's face instantly reddened. "Isn't it easy to ask your boyfriend to borrow you some money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happens after I ask him? Will you write an IOU? Will you put up this house as collateral? If you can't pay, will you sell the house and other family assets to pay the debt?" Valda Theller asked rhetorically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough, Valda. You don't have to borrow us money if you don't want to. Why say such things? I think of you as family, but you don't. If your father were still alive, he would be so angry that he would slap you in the face for haggling over everything!" Ferris snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at her &lsquo;relative&rsquo;. Her father would probably have looked like her uncle when he was old, but her uncle was not her father after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If my father were still alive and knew that the inheritance he left me could only get me a small apartment after I became an adult, he would be heartbroken and outraged for the injustice I've suffered," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ferris became furious. "What's the matter? Are you complaining now? Don't you know how much it costs to raise a child?"</p></div>
