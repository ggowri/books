        <h1>Chapter 3086</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Brian's eyes, there was a hint of pain. "Her leg is lame. Yesterday, I consulted a specialist to examine her leg. They said that the treatment was delayed, and now the chances of curing it are very slim."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this point, Brian slammed his glass heavily onto the ground, causing it to shatter into pieces of glass shards. The liquid inside the glass spilled all over the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, why treat her like this! Why does she have to endure such pain? Why isn't the crippled person me instead!" Brian cried out in agony, pounding heavily on the nearby wall. "Why? Why?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was looking at his friend's painful expression, still in a state of extreme shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I didn't expect Valda to have a limp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, when he learned that Valda had given up her chance of survival to save Grace's daughter and chose to be swept away by the water, he greatly admired her bravery and selflessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, how many people in this world can actually achieve something like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even for people who love each other, when faced with life and death situations, they may go their separate ways. So how much emotion could Valda have for a child she has only met a few times?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All I can say is that Valda's decision was driven by her kindness and her desire to do what's best for Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, shouldn't you be staying by her side if that's the case? Have you asked her why she doesn't want to see you? I mean, she loves you, right?" Patrick asked after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know," Brian said bitterly. "I told her I love her and miss her very much, but she thinks I only said those things out of pity and guilt for her. She doesn't believe me, she doesn't believe..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly grabbed Patrick and asked, "What should I do to make her believe what I'm saying? Tell me, please..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was being pulled by the collar by Brian, almost out of breath. "You...at least calm down first and let me help you think!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Think...yes, please help me think..." Brian murmured, then let go of his hand and slumped onto the sofa, picking up another empty glass and drinking from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He drank heavily, as if trying to numb the pain with alcohol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the course of the year, Patrick witnessed too many of his friends in pain. He thought that finding Valda would put an end to all of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I didn't expect Valda to come back now, but Brian's pain doesn't seem to have ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you ever considered that maybe she's feeling insecure?" said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Inferiority complex?" Brian looked at Patrick in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it's insecurity," Patrick said. "Valda was originally just an orphan who lost both parents. Over the years, she has been living under the care of others. Even though she has achieved some success in drawing comics, in the end, it's just a small comic, which is a far cry from what you can do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't care about any of this at all!" Brian growled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You may not care, but that doesn't mean she doesn't care. As far as I know, when she's with you, your family has accepted her, but in high society, others have talked behind her back, saying she's trying to climb the social ladder and using other derogatory words. This is just what I know, how do you know what kind of things she's heard before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was stunned, "But she has never told me that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"With her personality, she naturally wouldn't bother you with these messy things. Although she used to be insecure, at least she could overcome her insecurity for the sake of her feelings for you. But now..."</p></div>
