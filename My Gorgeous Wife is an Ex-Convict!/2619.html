        <h1>Chapter 2617</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why did you do it?" she could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were dark. It was... a refusal to answer. He did not allow her to inquire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want a girlfriend. At the minimum, we must appear affectionate in front of people. If you ever meet someone you truly like, you can dump me for whatever reason you want," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She figured out from the man's speech that he had no intention of falling for her. Dating seemed to be an act of necessity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, will you be my girlfriend?" His dark phoenix eyes stared at her as his elegant voice asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, she heard her voice saying... "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I agree? It's obvious that this man only wants a relationship in name, but I agreed to it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could not help raising her hand and knocking herself on the head at the thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was I charmed by his beauty? I said yes to such a ridiculous offer because he was so good-looking.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the phone rang. Valda Theller picked up her phone and tapped on the answer button. Her best friend Camille Strickland's voice came from it. "Valda, when are you free? Let's discuss the theme for your new comic."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller replied, "Okay, I'm free tomorrow. Let's do it tomorrow morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll come to your studio tomorrow morning," said Camille Strickland. As an editor at a comic magazine, she had always been in charge of her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, accompany me to a blind date tomorrow night after we discuss the theme," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're going on another blind date?" Valda Theller was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. My blind date said he&rsquo;d bring a friend and asked me to bring a friend too. Maybe it'll lighten the mood. Besides, the friend he's bringing is also single. You can give it a try if you click with that friend," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her best friend had been single for years after getting hurt in her previous relationship. She sometimes wondered if Valda shut herself off from relationships because she was so badly hurt back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Camille Strickland's worries shattered when she heard what her best friend said next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I already have a boyfriend," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" The startled voice exploded on the phone. Going out of tune, Camille Strickland shouted, "What did you say? You have a boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I guess I have a boyfriend.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? What does he do for a living? How did you know each other? Why haven't you mentioned him before?" Camille Strickland asked a series of questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller then realized she seemed to have no idea what he did for a living. However, the man was dressed in a suit and tie. Maybe he had to wear a suit for his job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've only met him twice... Uh... I forgot to ask what he does for a living," Valda Theller said lamely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was speechless. "You agreed to date him without even knowing what he does for a living? Do you not know your boyfriend's name and where he lives?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was even speechless. She seemed to really&hellip; have no idea!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was too shocked and confused. She only heard him say, "Okay, that's settled then." After that, the man left the small restaurant, and she followed suit.</p></div>
