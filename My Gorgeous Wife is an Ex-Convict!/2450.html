        <h1>Chapter 2448</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell muttered coldly, "A family... Ha!" The last chuckle was filled with irony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's take Amber Mitchell back to the ward to rest first," said Grace as she stepped out to run the show. Kyla replied in acknowledgment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bodyguards blocked off the reporters. Kyla wanted to accompany Amber Mitchell to the ward, but George Gregory moved his feet and stopped in front of Amber Mitchell's wheelchair when they were about to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked up at the man before her as her wheelchair stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was as handsome as ever with an added sense of maturity. However, her intense affection for him had been replaced with hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hated the man for saying he loved her but refusing to believe in her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hated the man for watching her be helplessly branded as a mental patient without helping her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she hated... herself the most for blindly falling in love with such a man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is everything you said earlier true?" George Gregory murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell parted her dry lips slowly. "Mr. Gregory, don't you find your question ridiculous?" Her hoarse voice still sounded like a broken gong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her voice struck hard at his heart like the toughest whip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the thought of her being locked up in a mental hospital for so many years when she was not ill had made him feel as though he was standing on the edge of a precipice and would fall into the abyss with just one more step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Amber Mitchell's wheelchair passed by in front of him and the figure in the wheelchair finally disappeared from his vision, he looked down slightly. The surrounding reporters swarmed toward him, wanting to interview him. However, they were blocked by the police and his men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When George Gregory turned around to leave, Louise Mitchell instantly stopped him and said in a slightly nervous voice, "George, where are you going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to stay here and let people laugh at you?" George Gregory walked away. Embarrassed, Louise Mitchell bit her lip and quickly followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell quickly told George Gregory once they got into the car, "George, don't believe what Sis said. She's a mental patient. What if someone had taught her to say those things? Her so-called 'friends' only want to use Sis to gain more benefits from the Mitchell family. They must have bribed the psychiatrist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory only looked down as if he was thinking of something. He did not pay any attention to Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George, did you hear me? Why don't we think of a solution? If Sis is diagnosed as mentally sound, we&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We what?" George Gregory interrupted Louise Mitchell and stared at her with cold eyes. "Should we get more doctors to prove that she's mentally ill or prove that she's now normal because of the treatments she previously received in the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell felt a cold sweat break out on her back. It was as if the man had seen through her.</p></div>
