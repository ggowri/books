        <h1>Chapter 251</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, Evelyn could only focus all her hate on Grace. If it had not been for Grace, she would not have suffered such humiliation today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all Grace's fault! Sooner or later, she would get even with Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn bitterly said in her heart, but in reality, she could only kneel. After all, she could not afford to offend Jason. Plus, Brian was her backer now, so she could not fight with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even wanted to be Brian's last girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when she knelt in front of Grace that Grace slightly frowned. She stepped back a couple of paces and turned to the director who looked rather frightened. She said, "Sorry, Director. I'm afraid I can't take part in today's scene. You don't need to pay me. I'm leaving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright..." the director responded with a shudder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace headed straight for the dressing room, ready to change out of her costume. Jason followed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Brian looked back at Jason and Grace, a sharp glint flashed across his phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Evelyn saw them leave, she wanted to get up and put an end to the kneeling and groveling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian lightly said, "Go on, I didn't let you finish. What's the hurry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stunned, Evelyn looked at Brian and saw that his expression was serious. He wanted her to get down on her knees to continued and grovel. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Jason asked her to do this to stand up for Grace, what about Brian? Was he standing up for Grace, too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the thought of this possibility, Evelyn felt an unstoppable panic. The feeling was far greater than the fear she had felt in the face of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Countless eyes were fixed on her. Evelyn looked at Brian, but he showed no signs of changing his mind, so she continued kneeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only thing that made her feel better was that at least she no longer had to kneel in front of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian took out a bracelet and hung his head low to play with it. It was as if Evelyn who was kneeling on the ground was just a mass of air in his eyes. He only had this bracelet in his eyes. It was as if it was all he had...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace arrived in the dressing room, she was stopped by Jason. "Why did you leave? Why, you don&rsquo;t like the sight of your so-called &lsquo;sister&rsquo; kneeling before you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have no interest in that," Grace said. Just because Evelyn enjoyed watching her kneel did not mean that she also enjoyed watching others kneel before her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you vent out your anger today? If that's not enough, I can take it out for you again. What do you want Evelyn to do? You can tell me," Jason said, raising his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you standing up for me?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you're my Sis." He smiled as if she had asked an idiotic question. "You've been bullied, so of course I'm standing up for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sis? The way he called her &lsquo;sis&rsquo; only made her feel more annoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no need. I don't need anyone to stand up for me," she said, turning and entering the dressing room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he had stood up for her this time, what about next time? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she just relied on others, then one day she might not be able to rely on them anymore. When that day came, the blow would be overwhelming.</p></div>
