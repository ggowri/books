        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon saying Grace's name, Zoe felt a belly full of anger.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace had caused that car accident back then, she had often heard people in high-end parties talking about how the Stevens Family was doomed, and it had caused her much embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was not until her brother had started going out with Lily that they had finally stopped talking about it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It took years.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She hated Grace for it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace is really a Jayx on our family. Fortunately, you broke up with her when he did. Can you imagine what would have befallen us if you&rsquo;d stayed with that trash?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean sighed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I heard she&rsquo;s a sanitation worker now. Fitting. How could the judge only sentence her to three years in prison? In my opinion, she should've been sentenced to at least ten or twenty!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe kept talking about Grace with a disgusted look, but the more she spoke, the more her brother seemed to recoil.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's enough. Zoe, don't talk about her anymore. When you see Grace, you'd better behave yourself," Sean said. &ldquo;Better yet, stay away from her entirely.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sean, what's wrong with you? I used to talk about her all the time, but you never said anything. Why are you protecting her now?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His parents chose that moment to come back into the room. His mom glanced nervously between him and Zoe.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sean, don't tell me that you still have feelings for her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Mr. Stevens heard this, he immediately frowned and said, "Don't even think about it. Grace Cummins is a blight on our name. She shouldn&rsquo;t even think about stepping through the door of this house!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I have no feelings for Grace, but she's someone we can't afford to offend! That's all I can say!" Sean gritted his teeth.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Can't afford to offend?" Zoe scoffed at his words. &ldquo;Sean, what are you talking about? Grace is a sanitation worker. She&rsquo;s a low-life. Totally insignificant. Why can't we afford to offend her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just listen to me. Don't harm the entire Stevens Family later because you&rsquo;re too stupid to listen to me now!" Sean warned sternly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Stevens was no fool. He sensed that Sean was choosing his words very carefully. And certainly, his son wasn&rsquo;t acting this way casually. "Sean, what exactly is Grace&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, there are some things that I can't say. You'd better all be a bit more careful. At least... at this stage, you should give Grace Cummins more respect," Sean said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean didn&rsquo;t know why or how Grace could have inserted herself into Jason Reed&rsquo;s life. And as the killer of Jason&rsquo;s former fiancee, it made absolutely no sense. But, at least for the moment, Jason still seemed to consider Grace to be of extraordinary importance.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean&rsquo;s visit to the Reed Family home had proven that.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The threat still weighed heavily on him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Stevens was deep in thought, and Sean&rsquo;s mom wasn't saying anything. Only Zoe curled her lips as if she didn't believe it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This is bullshit, brother. I don&rsquo;t owe that heinous bitch an ounce of respect. She nearly destroyed this family&mdash;and you. Do you have feelings for her still? Is that what this is about? Sean, don&rsquo;t be so foolish&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Zoe! That is enough!&rdquo; Sean punched his fist through the wall.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">***</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's gaze fixed on the box of stomachache medicine on his desk. This was the medicine that Grace had left for him when he felt sick last time. He was fully recovered, and, had she not been so distraught, he wouldn&rsquo;t have taken the prescription in the first place, but he hadn't thrown the medicine away. Instead, he had continued to leave it on the desk.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Terrence, what do you think Grace will do if she finds out about my true identity?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence froze. He&rsquo;d been in the process of collecting the contracts and budgetary reports that Jason had approved. He paused and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Did you hear me?&rdquo; Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence nodded. "Uhh..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Huh? Is it very difficult to answer this question?" Jason raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's not difficult, sir. But I don't know if my boss would be willing to accept my answer.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to accept or reject what you say. I simply asked you a question.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence nodded. &ldquo;Very well. I think that Miss Cummins will feel deceived.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence took it a step further. &ldquo;She has been subjected to much and is &hellip;vulnerable. She does not trust most people, and such a betrayal would cut her deeply.&rdquo;</p></div>
