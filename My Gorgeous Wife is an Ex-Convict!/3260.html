        <h1>Chapter 3258</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason had already unbuttoned half of his shirt, and he raised his eyebrows slightly. "So, do you want to continue?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace smiled and walked up to him, wrapping her arms around Jason's neck. "Of course, we'll continue when we get home. But if they don't leave, will you really take off this shirt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you think?" Jason calmly replied. "What about you? If I continue to undress, will you let others watch?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace stood on tiptoe and kissed Jason's lips. "Guess!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything else... is left unsaid...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and Brian returned to the villa, and Valda said, "Why did you just carry me away like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, were you planning to keep watching?" Brian raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blushed slightly. "I... I wasn't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"None? Then who was staring at Jason?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I was just surprised," she quickly explained. After all, Jason had started taking off his last piece of clothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I didn't take you away, were you planning on continuing to watch?" Brian asked, his voice clearly tinged with jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I would have turned my head and not looked," she said, but it sounded like she lacked confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Brian picked up Valda and carried her towards the bed in the bedroom. "Even if you wanted to watch, I wouldn't let you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he carefully put her down and began taking off his own clothes. "If you want to watch, you can only watch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face immediately turned even redder. He knew how tempting he looked right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Brian took off his clothes, he leaned down and kissed Valda's rosy cheeks. "What were you talking about before playing cards today? Your face turned red when you were chatting with them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We...we weren't talking about anything special, just...normal conversation," she muttered. His delicate kisses kept falling on her cheeks, making her breath even more unstable. It was as if all the blood in her body was rushing to her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without looking in the mirror, Valda could tell how red her face was just from the burning sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there really nothing?" Brian clearly had no intention of letting go of the topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"...Really." She replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a daze, she only felt his hands gently undoing her clothes, and his lips approaching her ear, his low voice ringing in her ear, "Then just talk to me about the ordinary things we were chatting about earlier. Let me know why you're blushing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She became even more dizzy, his breath in her nose, her mind almost blank. "It's...it's about giving birth...they were telling me how to make it easier to give birth..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The words came out of her mouth, and Valda finally understood how terrifying beauty could be. No wonder so many people have used it throughout history.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she were a security agent, he could probably charm her into revealing anything he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Children..." Brian said thoughtfully, kissing her face and neck one after another. "What did they say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just...do it more times, cast a wider net..." She stuttered, realizing what she had said only after the words had left her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she just wanted to bury herself in the covers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh my god, what did she just say!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian raised an eyebrow and said, "I see. Since they came up with this idea, let's give it a try and see if we can really have a child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he finished speaking, he lay on top of her body...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The night was filled with indescribable tenderness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A child...he also wanted to have a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because it would be their child, he wanted it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had warmed his life and filled him with hope for the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And from now on, they would continue to be happy together with their child...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">***</p></div>
