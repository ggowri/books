        <h1>Chapter 2141</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'He's dirty... because of me. He must have been looking after me around the clock these days. How dirty he is is just a sign of how much he loves me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson finally took off his coat and pants before lying on Lina's hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at the man lying beside her. "Alright, hurry and sleep. You've had to go through a few rough days, darling."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her voice sounded like the best lullaby for him, and he slowly closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps he was too tired these days, so he fell asleep almost as soon as he closed his eyes. He even snored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at the man beside her with teary eyes. She edged closer with difficulty, put her lips to his forehead, and kissed him softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin, I&rsquo;ll never part with you," murmured Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace came to the hospital to visit Lina the next day, she saw that her best friend had woken up and was eating congee. She had not eaten for days because she was in a coma, so she could only have some liquid food when she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was lying beside Lina and sleeping soundly. On the other hand, Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney were burping their precious baby granddaughter who had just finished drinking her milk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The baby who was less than a month old was quiet. She only cried a little when she was hungry. She stopped crying once she was full and soon fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney saw Grace, they quickly asked her what had happened last night and why their daughter had suddenly woken up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina also looked at Grace curiously. She only remembered that the ward was chaotic when she woke up last night! Many people were around, but she was only focused on Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed... the mysterious boy she had seen was there too, but she could not remember what he had said or done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She woke up when it was almost dawn, and she forgot to ask Hadwin what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace then gave a brief account of what had happened last night. Lina was shocked when she heard that she woke up after drinking the little boy's blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She asked with surprise, "The boy's blood can do that? So he saved my life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That kid saved you twice and the baby once." Grace went on to tell her best friend what had happened in the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina gaped. She felt as if she was listening to a made-up story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's so unbelievable," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. I asked Jay afterward, and he said the Hunter family is very mysterious. Perhaps families like that have some magic power?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That was the only speculation Grace could come up with so far.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Wow. I have to thank the kid, then. Do you know where the kid lives?" asked Lina.</p></div>
