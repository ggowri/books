        <h1>Chapter 2392</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze as if she had not thought of the probability at all. She only knew she felt safe when Martin Weiss was by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss sighed. "Alright. Just don't say such triggering words if you see George Gregory again.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla muttered, "George Gregory didn't seem to know about Amber Mitchell's missing finger when I mentioned it just now. But he said Amber Mitchell is only a lunatic now. Did he really love Amber Mitchell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. If he had never loved her, he wouldn't have reacted that way when you said that," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He reacted as if he had some deep vendetta against Amber Mitchell," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can there be hate if there's no love? The more you love, the more you hate," Martin Weiss murmured as he gazed at the person in front of him. "Don&rsquo;t you know that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla trembled slightly. 'Yes, how could I not understand it? It's... the same... as what&rsquo;s going on between him and me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He hates Amber Mitchell? Is it because of the rumors between Amber Mitchell and Herman Moss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Only the three of them know whether they're rumors or not. Perhaps they're not," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, Amber Mitchell wouldn&rsquo;t have a change of heart if she truly loves someone. Even if she did, she wouldn&rsquo;t have dragged it out and would have broken off the engagement right away to stop the rumors," said Kyla. After all, Amber Mitchell had always been straightforward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You only know Amber Mitchell during your time in prison. You only know one side of her," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, you've met George Gregory today. You can only take things one step at a time if you want to know what happened," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Take things one step at a time...' Kyla felt emotional. How could Amber Mitchell wait for her to take things one step at a time? The longer Amber Mitchell stayed in the mental hospital, the more she would suffer! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory walked out of the meeting room and returned to his office. He was exuding a gloomy air. Even the secretary who usually followed him around seemed cautious, afraid that they would say the wrong thing and annoy their boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get out. Nobody can enter without my permission," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the secretary answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was instantly left alone in the office. After a long time, he took out his phone and dialed a number. "I want information about Amber Mitchell's years in the mental hospital and whether she&rsquo;s missing&hellip; any body parts&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was almost as if he was using up all his strength to say the last part of the sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call was over, George Gregory closed his eyes in exhaustion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Amber Mitchell... Amber Mitchell...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How many years have I buried that name?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had not thought of the name for years, nor would he allow others to mention it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those who knew him well know that the name was taboo to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not expect a strange woman to mention it today. Besides that, that person said... Amber Mitchell's right ring finger was... gone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had slipped the engagement ring on her ring finger back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, her long finger looked so beautiful against the glittering diamond ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had not betrayed him and if Herman had not died, would everything have been different?</p></div>
