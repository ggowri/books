        <h1>Chapter 1415</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Several bodyguards following Martin Weiss stepped forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Martin Weiss had more people, the two men guarding Kyla Corbyn's ward did not budge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, they had received strict orders not to let certain people disturb Kyla Corbyn and Martin Weiss was among those &lsquo;certain people&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We're sorry to do this!" said the two men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Both parties were on the brink of a fight breaking out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the door of the ward suddenly opened and Kyla Corbyn stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the two men guarding the ward saw Kyla Corbyn appear, they hurriedly said, "Miss Corbyn, don't worry. If you don't want to see Mr. Weiss, he won't be able to break into the ward no matter what today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since they had been selected to keep guard here, they had what it took to keep people out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked up and her eyes fell on Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss was different from the last time she saw him. Although he was still impeccably dressed, he had a scruffy jaw and his hair looked a little messy. His face looked very haggard, and even his eyes seemed to have a tinge of redness in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a far cry from his usual solemn appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss looked almost greedily at the woman not far away. She was dressed in a hospital gown. She wore her long hair down, making her cheeks look thinner than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a scab on her forehead that looked a little red. It looked more obvious under the hallway lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His heart suddenly contracted, and his eyes felt as though they were stinging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The wound on her forehead... was probably caused by the forced groveling at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had been forced to grovel while being pressed to the floor. He had given out the order! For a moment, he wished that all the humiliation and pain were on him instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why did I stand by and watch her suffer from humiliation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why did I ignore her pain and despair?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The cold female voice rang in his ears. "Martin Weiss, what's the matter? Did you come here at this late hour to drag me to grovel and apologize to Paisley Daniels?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly trembled. He stumbled and seemed to lose his footing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a flash of pain in those narrow, deep eyes. One word from her could easily knock him down to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He said in a dry voice and an almost humble tone, "No... No. Kyla, I've come to apologize to you. I know I was wrong, very wrong. I shouldn't have believed what Paisley Daniels said and treated you like that&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn interrupted Martin Weiss, "Martin Weiss, I don't want to hear any apology from you. There's no need for that! It's very late now. My mother and Nelson are already asleep. I don't want to wake them, and I don't want to see you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even the way she looked at him was filled with disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he suddenly rushed up to her and nearly grabbed her when she turned around to go back to the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the two men guarding the ward stepped forward and stopped Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the end, what Martin Weiss grasped was only the hem of Kyla Corbyn's clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, even if it was only the hem of her clothes, he still grasped it tightly as if he was holding the last glimmer of hope. "Kyla, please. Will you listen to me for a while?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With his hoarse voice, he seemed to be begging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn was stunned, and there seemed to be some doubt in her eyes. However, it soon turned into cold disgust. "No thanks. There's nothing to talk about between us."</p></div>
