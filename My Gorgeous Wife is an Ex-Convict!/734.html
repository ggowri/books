        <h1>Chapter 733</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy?" Nelson did not call out to Kyla until they got into a taxi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he did not know why his mother had suddenly picked him up when he was picking out a birthday present for Aunty, he had always been an obedient child and knew there must be a reason for her to do that, so he kept quiet all the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; Saw someone I didn't want to see just now, so... I ran away with you in my arms. How about I bring you to buy a present for Aunty Grace next time?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one nodded and asked in a babyish voice, "Is the person you don't want to see a bad person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly found her nose to be a little sore. When Nelson was younger, he once asked her where his father was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each time he asked, she would say that his father was in heaven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wondered when Nelson would understand what it meant to be in heaven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she knew that she could not tell him that his father was only a few dozen meters away from them, and she could not tell him that he had actually met his father before. It was just that his existence was never what the man expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man had never even thought of having such a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, why are you crying?" His tender little hand caressed Kyla's cheek. His pretty little face was filled with a precocious worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla finally realized she had burst into tears at some point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, don't cry. I... I'll be a good boy. I'll work harder in learning to speak, to use the hearing aid, and learn a lot of words," said the little one, thinking that his mother was feeling sorry for him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was because before he could hear, his mother would always hug him and cry before saying something to Grandma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only knew limited lip language, but he knew that his mother and his grandmother were talking about his hearing disability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not hear, so his mother would be sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ever since he put a hearing aid on his ear, his mother would look at him happily every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not like to see his mother cry. He wanted his mother to laugh happily every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He needed to work very hard to learn how to speak well. Then, he would make his mother laugh every day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her son's sensibility made Kyla's eyes feel sorer. "All right, I won't cry. I want to accompany you to learn to speak a lot of words."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I want to spend my whole life with Nelson, but... My heart seems to be getting more and more uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can I really get away with it? Can I avoid Martin Weiss?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That night after Nelson had fallen asleep, Mrs. Corbyn looked anxiously at her daughter and said, "You ran into Martin Weiss today. Did he see you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know." Kyla shook her head. She just held Nelson in her arms and rushed to the exit passageway, only thinking about leaving the mall quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he does find us, then we..." Mrs. Corbyn said hesitatingly, "Since he's looking around for you like this, is he still&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla knew that her mother was imagining things again, imagining that Martin Weiss would pity her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if he had pitied her at all, he would not have been so cruel as to send her to prison without even giving her a chance to explain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, he's looking for me only because he&rsquo;s not satisfied with his revenge. In his opinion, it's too easy for me that I only spent a few years in prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn's eyes darkened as she sighed. "Do you have a plan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he really wants to take revenge, let him do it. However... I won't give him Nelson!" Kyla said with determination in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nelson means the world to me... Unless I'm dead, no way!'</p></div>
