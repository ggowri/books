        <h1>Chapter 1553</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His gaze made Grace feel a pang in her heart. &lsquo;Has he misunderstood something?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why trap Grace if you don't love her?" Brian faced Jason. "Or are you trying to deny ever having said you don&rsquo;t love her?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips tightly as he stared at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two men confronted each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace tried to pull her arm out of Brian's hand, but Brian's fingers were so tightly wrapped around her that she could not do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper Reed, who was standing beside Grace, was visibly scared. Her small hand held Grace's other hand tightly while her small face grew pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, Jason's thin lips curved as he sneered, "So what if I said that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As he spoke, he walked up to Brian, grabbed the man&rsquo;s hand, and said, "Even if I don't love her, Grace is still my wife. She can't go anywhere as long as I don't let her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even you can't stop her if she wants to go!" said Brian. It was because he would do anything to help her leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She occupied his heart. It was alright if Jason could give her happiness. However, he did not want to miss out on Grace again if Jason did not love Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well, then let&rsquo;s see if I can stop her or not!" Jason said coldly. Then, he told the subordinate behind him, "Carry the little young lady away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His subordinate responded and went over to carry Jasper away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jasper held onto Grace's hand and refused to leave. Grace could only say, "Jasper, be good. Daddy, Uncle Hart, and I have something to talk about. Why don't you follow this uncle inside and wait for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one seemed a little hesitant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Be good. Follow Uncle into the house. Daddy and I will go in soon. Your brother should be back now. Why don't you go in and help me find out what homework he&rsquo;s been tasked to do in the kindergarten today? Then we'll help him finish it," Grace said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one nodded and let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's subordinate quickly carried the little one into Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace finally let out a sigh of relief and turned to look at Brian. "Brian, let go. I won't leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you never going to leave him even if he doesn't love you?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said with great certainty, "Yes, I won't leave him. I'll never leave unless he asks me to leave one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Brian was stunned. "Do you love him that much? How am I any worse than him? He doesn't have to love you, but I can't do it. I met you first... and... I looked for you for years..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was silent. There was no first come, first serve in relationships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian was persistent about her and she believed he was sincere. However, her heart had no place for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her silence made Jason's eyebrows furrow slightly.</p></div>
