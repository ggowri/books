        <h1>Chapter 3423</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Archer Barlow emerged from the bedroom and said, "What's all the fuss about so early in the morning?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's your precious daughter after all. I can't believe she doesn't want Mason to stay with the Barlow family and instead wants him to go back to the Reed family. If Mason really goes back to the Reed family, what are we going to do?" said Rosalind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Archer heard this, his face immediately changed and he said to Veronica, "Veronica, did you really say that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I said it," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could you say something like that? You should know what Mason means to our family, the Barlows! In the future, you can't say such things casually, and especially not in front of Mason! Do you understand?" Archer said to his daughter with great seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What you need to do is figure out how to keep Mason in the Barlow family for as long as possible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Dad, are you planning on being a parasite forever?" Veronica asked. "Our family has relied on the Reed family for too long, but it's better to rely on oneself than on others. You should know this. If you always think about relying on and using others, one day you won't be able to rely on them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer became very angry and said, "What parasite? How dare you speak to your own father like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm telling the truth. Do you not know that many people outside are calling us, the Barlow family, parasites?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Veronica finished speaking, Archer raised his hand and slapped her across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a red mark appeared on Veronica's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough, you can't say things like that anymore!" Archer said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Rosalind said on the side, "Okay, Veronica, apologize to your dad. He's doing it for the whole Barlow family, isn't he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This couple, one playing the angry role and the other playing the conciliatory role.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica only felt a strong sense of fatigue and disgust. She didn't even want to say much, just picked up her bag and said, "I'm leaving." And she left directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Behind her, Archer was still cursing, while Rosalind was trying to persuade her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica walked out of the community and headed towards the subway station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she had woken up feeling excited today, her mood was now so depressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her father and stepmother were just using Mason as a tool to continue their parasitic lifestyle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she was probably an accomplice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that Mason would stay with the Barlow family solely because of her relationship with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps, over the years, Mason hasn't made many new friends and has spent most of her time revolving around the Barlow family due to her close relationship with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Mason had really been taken back to the Reed family back then and lived with them, he wouldn't be struggling to adapt to society like this now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Veronica thought of this, she felt a strong tightness in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't even know when she arrived at the entrance of the mall until she heard Daniel's voice, which snapped her back to reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with you? I called you so many times just now, it's like you didn't hear me," said Daniel as he ran up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I spaced out a bit just now," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Daniel frowned and asked, "What's wrong with your face?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Face?" Veronica was confused until Daniel's finger touched the red mark on her cheek. Then she realized it was the spot where her father had slapped her before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip and showed an embarrassed expression on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did someone hit you?" At this moment, Daniel also noticed the bruising on Veronica's face, which was a sign of being hit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gave a bitter smile and said, "I was beaten by my father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now it's Daniel's turn to feel embarrassed, "Sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...actually, I also used to get beaten by my father quite often!" Daniel said, trying to ease the awkwardness. "I've caused a lot of trouble since I was young, and my father didn't hesitate to hit me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But my father hits me not because I cause trouble, but simply because my thoughts are different from theirs," Veronica said, looking at Daniel. "Do you know what a parasite is?"</p></div>
