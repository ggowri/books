        <h1>Chapter 1692</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy looked down at his hands. The girl who played the piano just now said her name was Jasper and she wanted to play the piano with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Will it be fun to play the piano&hellip; if I play it with her?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did you have fun today?" A female voice beside him rang out. It was the woman driving who voiced out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It was okay," the little boy said flatly, but his replies usually consisted of one-word answers. Him saying three words was a rare exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" The corner of the woman's lips lifted as she smiled. "I'm happy too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">How could she not be happy to see the people whom she had not seen for years living such a good life? The better their lives were now, the more miserable they would be when they lost everything. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was no reason why she should be the only one living like a rat in the dark while that b*tch, Grace, lived such a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"William, do you like the little girl from just now?" the woman asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It did not bother the woman. She continued saying, "But remember, whether you like her or not, you and that little girl will never be friends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace and Jason came to the police station to give their statements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A group of reporters who came after getting wind of the news blocked the police station's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll have the driver drive to the side door where there are fewer people," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then I'll go to the washroom first. Give me a second," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace went to the bathroom, and Jason stood in the hallway not far away. He leaned against the wall, thinking about Damian Harmon and Irene Lynch's statements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Neither of them admitted that they had anything to do with the flower pot incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Of course, they could be lying. We can only continue to investigate it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But... if it really wasn't them... who could it be? Who hates Grace so much that they wish for her to die?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes darkened at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, a policewoman walked over with Irene Lynch. The suspect needed to use the bathroom, so the policewoman was accompanying her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was handcuffed, and her makeup still looked delicate. However, there was hardly any color on her face, which was full of confusion and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She even walked with her feet dragging on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch suddenly got agitated when she saw Jason. "Young master Reed, please... Please forgive me. Forgive me since fate brought Oriel to the Reed family. Wanna's the Reed family's adopted daughter. The Reed family's reputation will be affected if I go to jail..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason only stared coldly at Irene Lynch. "I've never cared about the Reed family's reputation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch froze and almost asked what he cared about!</p></div>
