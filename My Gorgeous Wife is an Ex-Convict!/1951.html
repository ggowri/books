        <h1>Chapter 1949</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason walked out of the cold meeting room. The calm and collected expression on Secretary Wang's face finally changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Be human... Be human... How can having a weakness not be a bad thing? How is that possible... I did everything for the Reed family and Old master Reed..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Secretary Wang shouted hysterically, which Jason could not hear, of course. Even if Jason could, he would not have cared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence respectfully opened the door of a black car that was waiting for him outside the prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let's go home," ordered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As the car drove slowly toward Reed Residence, Terrence said, "Young master Reed, someone has been looking into Lily recently."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes narrowed slightly. "Who's investigating Lily?" Lily was already dead. Even the Atkinson family wanted nothing to do with Lily. Who would be investigating Lily now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's the Barlow family from Deer City," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's thin lips slowly spat out a sentence. "The Barlow family? Philip Barlow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If there&rsquo;s no mistake, it should be him. The Barlow family must know about the feud between Lily and the Reed family, so there must be something going on since they dare to secretly look into Lily. Besides, without Philip Barlow's consent, the rest of the Barlow family wouldn't have the guts to do so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason pondered for a moment before asking, "Why does the Barlow family want to look into Lily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We don't know at the moment, but they&rsquo;ve been looking up what Lily did in the last five years or so... It seems they&rsquo;re also checking whether Lily has given birth," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Keep your eyes on them and find out what the Barlow family wants to know," ordered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once the car reached Reed Residence, Jason got out and learned from Uncle Kwan that Grace and the children were now in the back garden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason then walked to the back garden, only to see Grace playing Chinese jump rope with the three children there. It was a game that could even be said to be ancient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was also rare to see anyone playing Chinese jump rope nowadays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William and Mick Reed stood on two sides with the rubber band rope attached to their calves, obediently being two pillars. Jasper stood on another side of the rubber band rope while Grace showed the three children how to play the game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her long hair was tied into a simple ponytail, and she was wearing light blue sportswear. The most simple rubber band rope kept changing into new patterns at her feet. She was like a dancing butterfly that he could hardly take his eyes off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The three little ones watched intently. It was obviously their first time seeing this. In particular, Jasper kept clapping her hands and looked eager to try. If Grace was not skipping, the little one would have rushed over and skipped on her own!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace finished skipping, she realized Jason had walked over at some point. She could not help asking, "When did you get home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just now." Jason smiled. "I just noticed that you're good at Chinese jump rope."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm not that good. I haven't played this for years and almost forgot how to do it," said Grace. When she was a child in the small town, there was not much to do for entertainment, so most girls would get together and play Chinese jump rope between classes or after school.</p></div>
