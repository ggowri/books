        <h1>Chapter 4202</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The accident happened without any warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit only felt a tremendous impact, and then he passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he woke up, he was already in the emergency room of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Tina? How is Tina?" He didn't care about his own injuries and kept asking the doctor about Tina's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The woman who was in the accident with you? She's still in the emergency operating room. Because she's 8 months pregnant and also because of the accident just now, she needs an emergency C-section to deliver the baby!" the doctor said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit's face suddenly turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about her? How is she doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll have to wait for the doctors in the operating room to come out to know." the doctor said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just by looking at the doctor's expression, Kit already knew that Tina's condition was not optimistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was supposed to be a beautiful dream, but in the blink of an eye, it turned into a nightmare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the operating room? I want to go see her!" Kit suddenly got up, wanting to find Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he moved, the pain made him fall back onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor and nurses hurriedly checked his condition. The doctor said, "You shouldn't get up for now. Your injuries are severe, with several broken bones and damaged internal organs. You need to cooperate with the treatment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to wait outside the operating room. Please let me go... please..." Kit pleaded desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor and nurses exchanged glances, seeing Kit's firm attitude and refusal to cooperate with treatment. They had to discuss it with their superiors and then pushed the mobile bed to the outside of the operating room.</span></p></div>
