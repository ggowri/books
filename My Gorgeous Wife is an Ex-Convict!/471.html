        <h1>Chapter 470</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if she depended too much on him, perhaps it would slowly become a habit...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He leaned down and kissed her still swollen cheek gently. The kiss was so soft, it was like the stroke of a feather. "Then depend on me. It&rsquo;s the very thing I desire."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to depend on him so much that she could not leave him&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">About half an hour later, the family doctor came to Reed Residence. He took a look at Grace's swollen cheeks and prescribed some medicine to reduce the swelling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the doctor left, Grace was about to apply the medicine when Jason took it from her. "I'll do it for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He dipped his long fingers into the ointment and gently spread the oil across her cheek. His movements were very gentle. With the coolness of the ointment, her cheek was no longer burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're a real pain in the neck. You're always getting hurt," he whispered. He was still applying the ointment on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found herself unable to refute what he said. She really did seem to have suffered all sorts of minor injuries since meeting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wish I can hide you at home so that no one will hurt you. Then I won't always see you getting hurt," he said. Every time he saw a wound on her body, it made him feel as if his heart had been stung.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can you hide me at home?" she mumbled, assuming he was joking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He drew back his fingers, took a tissue, and wiped the ointment off it. Then, leaning down and looking at her, he said, "If you keep getting hurt, I'll really hide you at home. Even if you're willing to hurt yourself, I can't bear to see you hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark and deep eyes were full of seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the man in front of her. Was he... serious? Was he not kidding?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, go back to your room first. If you're tired, take a break," Jason said as he picked Grace up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She let out a low cry and almost unconsciously threw her arms around his neck. She could not help saying, "I can walk on my own." She was only slapped in the face. She was not hurt anywhere else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take you with me so that I don't have to worry about you falling on your own," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face could not help but redden a little. Did he take her as a child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He carried her back to her room and laid her carefully on the bed. "You're tired today. Take a break."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. She was actually a bit tired now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, she fell asleep. Jason looked at Grace's face while she was sound asleep. Other than the tender love in his eyes, there was also a touch of deep rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Atkinson family... It seemed that the Atkinson family had been too comfortable for so long that they forgot something...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace woke up to find that it was already dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" she gave a sudden cry and sprang out of bed. She forgot to buy something for her grandmother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why did you yell?" a voice rang, accompanied by the sound of hurried footsteps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked in the direction of the voice and saw that the door which connected her bedroom to Jason's bedroom was not closed. Jason was now hurrying across from the other bedroom.</p></div>
