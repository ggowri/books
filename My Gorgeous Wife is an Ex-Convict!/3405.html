        <h1>Chapter 3403</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Mason's gaze was fixed on Veronica who was standing nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt relieved only when Veronica came into his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he didn't think today's birthday party was very important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He never thought that birthdays were something to be taken seriously, but because his older sister said that birthdays represent the day he was born, they should be celebrated properly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every year, the Reed family would throw a birthday party for them, and every year on this day, he actually found it quite boring. But if his older sister could be happy, then he could endure this boredom and playacting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His older sister also said that he and his family were connected by blood, and they should be closer. Those people were his relatives, and they were all good to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Connected by blood...what kind of feeling was that? He wasn't really sure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But over the years, he had gradually gotten used to the presence of these people, and sometimes he could even accept their affectionate hugs and do things for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because they were family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The triplets cut the cake together, while flashes of light and cheers from the crowd continued around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After cutting the cake, Jasper played a piano piece in front of everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, Jasper is playing Liszt's Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige, which is the same piece Lawrence played before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William is watching Jasper play under the spotlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wonders if she is still thinking about Lawrence while playing this piece.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knows that she has never let go of Lawrence all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Lawrence was just a young boy she spent a few months with, he has always been treasured in her heart. William feels jealous, but he can do nothing about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, she is shining brightly under the spotlight, while he is just a member of the audience. How many steps does he need to take to truly get close to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the piece ends, Mason stands up and thanks everyone. He says that the piece is dedicated to everyone and to his friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper doesn't say anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Lawrence disappeared, she has made a birthday wish every year for his safety and for him to appear in front of her someday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's expression changes slightly. It seems that Lawrence is still very important to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a hand rested on William's shoulder. He turned his head and saw that it was his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Philip and William walked to a corner and Philip said, "What's wrong? Do you feel uncomfortable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad," William furrowed his brow slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, you may experience this feeling more and more. Right now, you consider Jasper to be the most important person in your life, but she probably only sees you as a friend. Given Jasper's background and appearance, she will likely become more and more prominent, and she will be surrounded by various outstanding men. When that time comes, you will have to compete with more than just Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know," William's face showed a hint of determination. "But I won't give Jasper to anyone. I will make myself better and make Jasper like me so much that she won't be able to leave me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since your idea, Grace, hasn't changed, then work hard. However, I also hope that you don't get too fixated on things. In this world, many things can be achieved through hard work, but only emotions are the most unpredictable and even with effort, there may not be a return," said Philip.</p></div>
