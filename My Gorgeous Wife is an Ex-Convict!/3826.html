        <h1>Chapter 3824</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, you were willing to risk your life to save me, but why did you still want to break up with me?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason pursed his thin lips and looked straight at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was asking him why...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he had asked himself why!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already decided not to care about her anymore, not to be controlled by this woman anymore, but why did he still risk his life to save her when he found out she was in danger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the end, he gave her the chance to survive, just hoping that she would live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as though in his subconscious, her life was more important than his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you worried that I don't love you enough? Afraid that one day I'll fall in love with someone else? Afraid that your feelings will once again be misplaced?" She spoke the answer he had been searching for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the answer she had come to after much contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, I don't want to be hypnotized again. I don't want to look back on my life and realize that I was just a passerby." Mason said, this feeling was not a good one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes it even made him feel less than human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if his life had become insignificant, and his emotions were becoming increasingly diluted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the part of him that belonged to humanity was slowly being severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to be hypnotized again, then why not trust me this time?" Veronica murmured, "Trust that my feelings for you will last until the end, until the day we truly die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have trusted you before." He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't trust her, he wouldn't have started a relationship with her in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was that trust destroyed because I asked you not to hit Daniel?" Veronica continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When it came time to make a choice, you didn't stand by my side, did you?" Mason said, "Veronica, if you don't want me to ruin you in the future, then you better leave me now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at him, "What do you mean by 'ruin me in the future'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My emotions are too extreme, and you can't handle my extreme emotions." He said, "Yes, I understand why you asked me not to hit Daniel, but what does that matter? I'm tired. If I continue to be with you, I'll be constantly guessing how much you really love me. When I see you walking with other men, I'll wonder if you'll fall in love with someone else, if you'll leave me. Do you understand this anxious and uneasy feeling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he had spoken so clearly about his emotions to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica stared at the person in front of her in confusion. So, does this mean that he doesn't feel secure in their relationship?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has he always been the one who lacks security in their relationship?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this be?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their relationship, he has always been the dominant one. He was the one who suggested "trying to date" and he was the one who took the lead when they officially started dating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was more passive, constantly trying to win his affection. So why does he still feel uncertain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because of their high school days?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he liked her but she rejected him and chose to be with Daniel. Has this become a shadow over their relationship?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you...not believe that I truly love you?" It took Veronica a while to say these words with a dry throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason didn't say anything, but his silence was already an answer.</span></p></div>
