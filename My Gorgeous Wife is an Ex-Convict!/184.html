        <h1>Chapter 183</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You can go home for the night,&rdquo; Jason said to Terrence who followed him in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shock flashed across Terrence&rsquo;s eyes. However, since he had been following Jason for such a long time, he understood that there were some things that he should not ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Terrence responded and left the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Since Young Master Reed asked me to leave, then I guess this means that Young Master Reed... is going to stay here tonight?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the rented house, there were only Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He helped her remove her shoes and coat before he pulled the covers over her. Then he pulled a chair to sit by the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he thought about it, it had been a while since he lived here. This house no longer had any traces to prove that he once lived here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Has she thrown out all my things?&rsquo; That thought made him frown as a sense of displeasure rose in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Grace, who was supposed to be fast asleep, suddenly opened her eyes and wanted to get out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With half-opened blurry eyes, she mumbled, &ldquo;Water... I need water...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was probably feeling parched from drinking so much wine earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sighed and firmly sat her on the bed. &ldquo;Sit here and don&rsquo;t move. I&rsquo;ll get you some water.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was worried that she might scald herself if she went to get water on her own in her current state!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He walked over to the little table where her hot flask was. He knew that she would usually pour a cup of cold water and add some hot water into it during the winter season. The water would then become warm water, a suitable temperature to drink during cold days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took a cup and mixed some warm water for her before returning to the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, she was obediently sitting on the bed with her back straight, looking like a good student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not hold back his laughter when he looked at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if she heard him, she raised her chin and looked at him with her half-opened almond eyes. Her face was colored with shades of red, her lips as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Water... I need water...&rdquo; she kept mumbling, but her sitting position remained the same as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He found her inexplicably cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Alright, here&rsquo;s your water.&rdquo; He carefully angled the cup to her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She clumsily reached for the cup and gulped the water all at once before releasing a long breath. With a satisfied smile, she said, &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Did you have enough? Do you want more water?&rdquo; he asked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She cocked her head to the side as if trying to comprehend what he was saying before finally murmuring, &ldquo;Sleepy... Need sleep...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then just...&rdquo; He could not complete the last three words &lsquo;go to sleep&rsquo; when she had already reached out her hand and pulled him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was caught by surprise as she managed to pull him onto the bed with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the next moment, she was already on top of him, smiling demurely as her fingers lightly traveled on the skin of his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Jay...&rdquo; Her gentle voice rang through his ears. Her sweet scent was mixed with the smell of wine that could intoxicate anyone. &ldquo;Tell me, why are you so good looking?&rdquo;</p></div>
