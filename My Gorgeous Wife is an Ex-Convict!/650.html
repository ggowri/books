        <h1>Chapter 649</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only two hours after her grandmother's death that Grace's first uncle, second uncle, and third aunt arrived at the hospital one after another at the hospital's notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Grace's grandfather, Old Mr. Kelleigh, he did not come to the hospital on the pretext of poor health. He feared that he would be too sad and thus worsen his health after seeing the body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know how her grandmother would feel about her grandfather's comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When First Uncle, Second Uncle, and Third Aunt saw Grace, their first reaction was that Grace had to pay for her grandmother's grave and funeral on her mother's behalf. She could not get away from it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help getting angry. Her grandmother had just passed away, but First Uncle, Second Uncle, and Third Aunt only cared about money!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Pay?" asked Jason, who had been silent all along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did First Uncle and Second Uncle realized there was another person in the room. The haste and the fact that their niece was wearing a wedding dress was too much to notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">First Uncle and Second Uncle's faces immediately paled as they recognized him as the man they had met at the Miller family's house that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, they wanted to send Grace to the Miller family's house to marry their simpleton son, but that night, the man burst in with a bunch of people and took Grace away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the event, they were detained by the local police station for several days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why&hellip; Why are you here?" stammered First Uncle and Second Uncle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing Jason, Third Aunt said, "Your boyfriend's here, Grace. If you can't come up with the money, ask him to pay it for you. You&rsquo;ll pay for your grandmother's funeral and grave, won't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to say something when Jason put his hand lightly on her shoulder and said to Third Aunt, "Of course, it's all right to pay, but can you afford it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt looked puzzled. 'What does that mean?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">First Uncle and Second Uncle dragged Third Aunt away and briefly explained to her what had happened at the Miller family&rsquo;s house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt was not at home that night, so her impression of Jason was limited to when Grace brought Jason to visit her grandmother a while back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now that she knew Jason was the man who left with Grace that day, Third Aunt's expression changed. She looked at him in disbelief and mumbled, "Who the hell are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Grace's boyfriend. I think I've already made that clear," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you tell us that you're the one who took Grace away from the Miller family's house?" exclaimed Third Aunt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason chuckled and retorted, "Why would I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a cold, piercing look in his eyes that made Third Aunt's body tremble, fear rising in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man was not simple. The look in his eyes had some sort of unreachable coldness. How did she not notice it last time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she then seemed to have thought of something and calmed down. "It doesn't matter who you are. I think you're wasting your time coming here to strut around. You can't mess with our family. Just one word from my daughter and you and Grace may not be able to stay in Emerald City any longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">First Uncle and Second Uncle seemed to have been reminded of something, their expressions changing as they became arrogant. "Yes, we have backup now!"</p></div>
