        <h1>Chapter 705</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then, let's see who would dare to embarrass you." Jason gave a casual smile and looked at Grace tenderly. "Besides, I'm all yours now. What's so important about pride?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you care about it so much, why don't I embarrass someone more than you&rsquo;ll get embarrassed? Don't worry about it," Jason said casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know whether to laugh or cry. 'Come on, that's not the point at all.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car pulled up at the trade fair. Grace had done some research and knew that today's trade fair would mainly be attended by some well-known entrepreneurs. Besides the ones from Emerald City, there were also a few entrepreneurs from other cities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You could say that such exhibitions could promote a lot of business collaborations and help those entrepreneurs build connections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trade fair today set a high threshold, so a lot of small and medium-sized business owners did not even get an invitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were even people paying high prices for the invitations online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, networking was all that mattered these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many small and medium-sized business owners wanted an invitation to meet the big players they might not normally meet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was a bit confused. Jason did not like to attend such events unless it was necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you come here to meet someone today?" asked Grace. It was the only reason she could think of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard that Jewel Bailey will also be here today. She&rsquo;s been abroad but has recently planned to open a law firm in Emerald City," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately realized that he had brought her here today to give her a chance to meet Jewel Bailey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jewel Bailey was a female lawyer who Grace had admired since she was in college. However, she had never met Jewel Bailey in person since she was abroad and was involved in many foreign lawsuits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect that she could meet Jewel Bailey in a place like this now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How&rsquo;d you know I&rsquo;ve always wanted to meet Jewel Bailey?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be appropriate to call her a fan of Jewel Bailey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had also read many of Jewel Bailey's case studies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When you were reading the law books, you would read Jewel Bailey's case studies carefully and make a lot of notes. When you saw the news about Jewel Bailey returning to the country, didn't you say you wished for the opportunity to meet her?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not expect him to notice something so small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jewel Bailey had been her idol since college. She used to hope to become a female lawyer who ruled the legal world like Jewel Bailey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she ended up having her lawyer's license revoked, and it was only now that she got it back after reversing her case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was thinking about it when she caught a glimpse of two figures and immediately stiffened a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, who was standing next to her, naturally sensed the changes in her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Following her line of sight, he saw a couple chatting with others nearby. It was Sean and Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? Do you still mind?" Jason asked in a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's hands quivered a little. The sight of them seemed to make her fingers ache again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily had gotten someone to rip her fingernails off one by one, while the man who said he would protect her with his life just looked on indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when she kept saying she was wronged, it was of no use. All she got in return was more brutal treatment.</p></div>
