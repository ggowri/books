        <h1>Chapter 2405</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if it doesn't, I can create one right away." By this, he meant to tell her that what he had said was no coincidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know I want to approach Whitney Herrera to ask about Amber Mitchell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "It wasn&rsquo;t hard for me to find out that you came here with Kyla, and you went to a mental hospital to see Amber Mitchell before this. So I figured you're probably here for Amber Mitchell. Did you approach Whitney Herrera to find out what had happened back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace admitted it and said, "Yes. I need to know what role the Moss family played in this. According to what others said about what had happened back then, Amber Mitchell's illness was due to Herman Moss's death. However, if the person Amber Mitchell loved was George Gregory and not Herman Moss, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say Amber Mitchell went insane for him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you suspect that Amber Mitchell was not sick at the time but was forcibly sent to the mental hospital?" Brian froze and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. "It's possible, isn't it? Louise Mitchell is the biggest beneficiary after Amber Mitchell was sent to the mental hospital. Later, the Mitchell family merged some resources with the Gregory family. The Gregory family was the one who took the lead. The Gregory family has been taking over the Mitchell family's assets little by little. Maybe the Gregory family is the final winner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "It certainly is possible. Are you investigating these matters to prove that Amber Mitchell was sent to the mental hospital as part of a conspiracy and then get her out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if she's mentally ill?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We should at least get her a guardian who's sincerely kind to her, unlike her current one. When I went to the hospital to see Amber Mitchell, she was treated like a dog. The nurses pressed her head down on the plate and made her eat while her half-sister looked on smugly." Even an outsider like her was indignant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It won't be difficult to get her out of the hospital. I can do it for you," said Brian. He could help her do anything she wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Amber Mitchell would have to come out as someone else, not the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family. Besides, there would be no punishment for the people who wronged her," said Grace. It was not what she wanted. Besides, Kyla surely did not want Amber Mitchell to carry the label of a mental patient for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But it's the fastest way," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, but I'd like to try something else first. If it doesn't work out in the end, we&rsquo;ll give her another identity as you said," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Whitney Herrera returned to the private room. However, the assistant who went out with her did not enter the private room again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera said to Brian, "Mr. Hart, my husband said that he would like to meet you in person today and talk to you about the script. I wonder if you're willing, Mr. Hart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Sure, let's talk about it. Why don't your husband come here if he's free and we can talk now?"</p></div>
