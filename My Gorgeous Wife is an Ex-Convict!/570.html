        <h1>Chapter 569</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have expected Hadwin to tell her, "You're my girlfriend now. If I find out that you and Howell Webb are more intimate than ordinary fans and idols, I'll blacklist him in the entertainment industry. You might not see him on screen again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If someone else had said that, she would have thought that they were joking, but it was Hadwin... Lina guessed that with his narrow-mindedness, he might actually do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she should just forget about the phone number. She would be content with just a photo together, an autograph, and better still, a few posters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before long, a young woman came up to Grace and Lina. She said, "Hello, Miss Cummins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace recognized her as Howell Webb's assistant whom she had met with Howell Webb last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello," responded Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please follow me, ladies." She led the way along a separate staff passage. Grace and Lina followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not expect to take only a few steps before bumping into Evelyn on the staff passage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was now with her manager. They seemed to be talking to each other about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to pretend they did not know each other, but after seeing Grace, Evelyn took the initiative to say with a smile on her face, "Gee, what a coincidence, Sis! What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace squinted suspiciously. Evelyn had always disliked the idea of revealing their relationship as sisters in public. She felt disgraced by her imprisonment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was not being herself now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant leading the way alongside Grace showed a look of surprise, apparently not expecting Grace to be sisters with Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is the staff passage. Are you... Here for Howell Webb?" Evelyn recognized the assistant beside Grace to be the assistant Howell Webb brought with him today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins and her friend want to take a photo with Mr. Webb and get an autograph." The assistant offered to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Evelyn's words were ambiguous, and this was the staff passage near the entrance. There were many fans gathered here watching them. If it caused any misunderstanding, it would affect Howell Webb's image.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see." Evelyn smiled. "If Sis and Sis Lina want to see Mr. Webb, just say so and I'll take you there. Why bother Mr. Webb's assistant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, Evelyn approached Grace affectionately. She grabbed Grace in a display of affection as if she were going to take Grace to Howell Webb's lounge herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said coolly, "Let go. I don't care what you're up to, but I don't want to play along."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Evelyn smiled and said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, "You told me to let go. Don't regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Evelyn let go of her grip with a great jerk and staggered backward as if she was pushed hard by someone.</p></div>
