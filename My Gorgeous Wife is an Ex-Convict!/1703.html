        <h1>Chapter 1701</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one's skin was bruised, and his beautiful face was also slightly swollen. Grace could imagine how much more swollen his injuries were a few days ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Does it hurt?" Grace crouched down and looked straight at the child in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Mason's face was still swollen, his beautiful eyes were staring at the school gate in front of him as though he had not heard Grace's question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All he cared about was when his sister would be out of school and when he could see her. He did not care about the rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace raised her hand to touch one of his bruises, but the little one warily avoided her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I only want to check your bruises. I mean no harm!" Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one stared at her for a moment before slowly saying, "I don't like you touching me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then... Shall I take you to the hospital and let the doctor take a look at your bruises? It'll stop hurting after the doctor treats you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm not in pain," the little one said coldly before turning away to ignore Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one exuded some resistance and alienation. Grace could do nothing about it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Lina also walked over. She was surprised to see the little one's bruises as well. "Gosh, his parents are really ruthless to hit such a small child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, Lina bent down and smiled gently at the little one. "Hello, I heard your name is Mason. I'm Aunt Lina, a friend of the store owner over there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Unfortunately, the little one completely ignored Lina's gentle smile. Those beautiful eyes of his were just stubbornly staring at the school gate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why is this child so weird?" Lina whispered to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's how he is. It probably has something to do with how he grew up," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're right," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, more and more parents began to wait at the school gate to pick up their children. At that moment, the school gate opened and the students were let out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the quiet little one saw the figure he was expecting, a smile instantly appeared on his expressionless face. Although the smile was faint, it was still a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one rushed to the little girl who had a bag on her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was surprised. "What a huge change!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The siblings are really close," said Grace before walking up to the little girl. "Hello, we've met before. My name is Grace, and you can call me aunt Cummins. I'm a friend of the owner of the store over there. Your brother has a lot of bruises. Can I bring him to the hospital to get treated by a doctor?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow raised her chin slightly to look at Grace. She remembered her. Besides, every student in this school was familiar with the store owner because they often went there to buy snacks to eat after school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You don't want your brother to be in pain, do you? Besides, some bruises can turn into something major if they&rsquo;re not treated in time." Grace continued to persuade the little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew that Mason listened to the little girl very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why do you want to bring Mason to see a doctor?" asked Veronica Barlow.</p></div>
