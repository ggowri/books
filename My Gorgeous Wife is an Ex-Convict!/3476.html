        <h1>Chapter 3474</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Lionel was spending money like water outside. Despite being only a middle school student, he acted like a big shot. In reality, the people he was trying to impress were not interested in him, but rather the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, unfortunately, this younger brother of mine is still enjoying it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could it be that Mason has confessed his feelings to you?" Lionel suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica suddenly stopped moving and her face changed, and Lionel immediately knew that he had guessed correctly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sis, you didn't reject him, did you?" Lionel asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you care so much, you're just a kid?" said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not young anymore," Lionel said, pursing his lips. "Actually, since you've already broken up with Daniel, it would be great if you were with Mason. I don't think the Reed family would object, and our relationship with them would be extraordinary!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more Lionel spoke, the more Veronica felt repulsed. "Do you only care about relying on the Reed family? People who are together should want to be together for a lifetime, not just because of the other person's family background!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you not want to be with Mason for the rest of your life?" asked Lionel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica paused and then said, "Do you think that as long as there are enough benefits, it doesn't matter who you associate with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel shrugged, "But Mason is not bad either. He's handsome, the second son of the Reed family, does well in his studies, and is good at sports. Many girls in our class like him! Besides, Mason is good to you. Whatever you say, he will do it for you! Isn't this the kind of guy that girls dream of, a prince charming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough, get out!" said Veronica. "I don't want to discuss this kind of thing with you anymore. I'm telling you, you are my brother, and he is also my brother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel rubbed his nose and left Veronica's bedroom. However, upon returning to his own room, Lionel's eyes darted around. This wouldn't do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If her sister really breaks up with Mason because of this, then the Barlow family will be the unlucky ones!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, he will also suffer bad consequences. Currently, he is claiming to be the "brother" of the Reed family's Mason to others, but perhaps in the future, no one will consider him as the Reed family's Mason's brother anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He needs to do something to make his sister and Mason reconcile, maybe even make his sister willing to date Mason or something like that. It would be better for the Barlow family and for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason hasn't been going to school for a few days now, and as his fellow triplets, Mick and Jasper are naturally concerned about the reason behind his absence from school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how they asked, Mason simply replied with a casual statement, "I'm not interested in going to school. Even if I don't go, I won't fall behind in my studies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what about Sister Veronica? You haven't seen her for days, is everything okay?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's gaze flickered slightly and his thin lips curved into a smile. "It's okay." Perhaps Veronica secretly wished he wouldn't go to school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the private room that day, that slap seemed to represent Veronica's disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the pain on his face no longer hurts now, the feeling from back then is still deeply ingrained in his body and he can't seem to shake it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just wants to be with Veronica, why is it so difficult?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said that he doesn't understand emotions at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if he doesn't understand, then why is he feeling so upset?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I want to be with her, and if she doesn't understand something, she can teach me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He will definitely study hard and do better than anyone else!</p></div>
