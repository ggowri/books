        <h1>Chapter 1186</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took a deep breath and turned to look at her. "Someone sent these? Do you really not know who sent them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Stella shivered a little. It was as if his phoenix eyes could see through everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I don't know who sent them, but if I knew, I would have gone to him and asked him why he sent them!" Stella put on an aggrieved look and said, "Brian... Do you think I set this up? I know you like Grace and only think of me as your childhood savior. In that case, why should I bother? It's better for you to be with Grace rather than someone I don't know well. This way, there will always be room for me even if you marry Grace. You don't even need to sever ties with me or anything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella said piteously as if she meant it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at Stella with his thin lips pressed together. Moments later, he picked up his phone and dialed a number. "Look someone up for me. His name is Chase Harper! He used to work at the Sanitation Service Center. I'll send you his photo on my phone later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella lowered her eyes and unconsciously heaved a sigh of relief when she heard Brian's words. There was a faint gleam of triumph in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Things... are developing like what Evelyn said... Next, I just have to fan the fire and Grace and Brian will have a falling out...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll only have a chance if they have a falling out!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina was chatting with Grace online in the evening, she said, [I'm leaving Emerald City in two days to see Hadwin.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. [You're leaving Emerald City? For how long?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina replied, [Only about ten days. I didn't use up my annual leave this year, so I thought of clearing it. I don't know why but it seems that after experiencing that life and death situation, I really want to be with Hadwin. It's only been a short time since he left, but I miss him so much.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">[Does he know about this?] asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina replied, [I haven't told him yet. I'm afraid he won't agree with me. But he said he sent bodyguards to protect me in secret before he left Emerald City. I guess those bodyguards will inform him when I go there.] </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace messaged, [He's probably afraid you'll get in danger. After all, all sorts of forces are interweaving in the Stephenson family. It was Elizabeth Jackson who did such a thing this time, but who knows who's next? Why don't you stay in Emerald City and wait for him to come back after dealing with the Stephenson family?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">[I know that even if I go to him, I'm not going to be of much help with what he's going to do. But I just want to be there and face it with him... I know that I might be a burden if I stay with him all the time, so I'm just gonna be there for ten days] answered Lina. Otherwise, she was going to resign.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied, [Hadwin Stephenson will handle the Stephenson family's matter well, and I'm waiting to be your maid of honor when the time comes!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">[Yeah, I'm sure he can handle it!] Lina saw that it was getting late and typed, [Let's meet again and have a good meal when I come back.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">[Sure] replied Grace as she ended her online chat with her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The car accident has made Lina realize how much she loves Hadwin Stephenson. What about me?' Grace thought of herself. 'What has the accident taught me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mind flashed to Brian stumbling to her car, his face stained with blood. These scenes seemed to recur to her from time to time these days.</p></div>
