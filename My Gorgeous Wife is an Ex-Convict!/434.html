        <h1>Chapter 433</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gave him a weird stare. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his lips, and the clarity in his gaze returned. Subsequently, he smiled and said, &ldquo;Nothing. Go get changed.&rdquo; With that, Jason released his grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace went into the changing room and closed the door, Jason closed his eyes for a moment. The next time he opened them, the lust in his gaze was completely suppressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Earlier, he had wanted her there and then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His craving for her seemed to be getting out of hand lately. However, he could not do anything now. It was difficult enough for her to allow him near her, so he could not risk frightening her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was like a careful little animal that was alert and timid. Each step she took was with much caution. He needed to use his patience to let her dismiss the caution she had in her heart toward him and wait for her to learn to rely on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only that way could she fall in love with him, and only that way would she not leave him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had to be patient&hellip; Patience&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only because he wanted to earn her love!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace changed into her original clothes and shoes, she came out of the changing room to see Jason with his head lowered slightly. His expression seemed to be solemn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What is it? What are you thinking about?&rdquo; she asked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked up and smiled. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; He then took the clothes and shoes that were in her hands to pass them to the cashier so that he could make the payment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when they were going to take the elevator, a young girl suddenly ran over and stood in front of Jason. &ldquo;Hello, my name is Judy Dixon. I&rsquo;m currently a sophomore student at Shen University. Can we exchange numbers?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The girl had a youthful and sweet look. She had straight black hair that draped loosely over her shoulders. She was dressed from head to toe in branded goods that emphasized the curves of her figure. She looked like she came from a well-to-do family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason coldly glanced at her and rejected. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is it because of her? Is she your girlfriend?&rdquo; Judy Dixon openly pointed her finger at Grace who was standing next to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason squinted his eyes. A sense of danger rose within his gaze that made Judy Dixon shudder. At the same time, it also heightened her desire to win him over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a beauty that every boy in her class wanted. She had plenty of suitors trying to woo her, but she was not interested in any of them. It was rare that she found a man she was interested in. She did not believe that she was not able to win him over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For Judy Dixon, she was way better than the old and unfashionable woman standing next to him. Even if the woman had a pleasant look, Judy Dixon could tell that the woman lacked a proper skincare routine. Plus, her hair was limp and dull. Her clothes were so regular too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Even if she&rsquo;s your girlfriend, you can still choose. How would you like to date me? I&rsquo;ll make a very good girlfriend!&rdquo; Judy Dixon confidently said with her chin up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Usually, most men would take up her offer as they liked her innocent yet direct attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, a girl next to Judy Dixon who was around the same age as her said, &ldquo;Judy is our campus&rsquo; prettiest girl. Plenty of men are chasing after her at school. This is my first time seeing her making the first move.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, the girl meant that Jason should feel thankful for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A confident smile was plastered on Judy Dixon&rsquo;s face. She was sure that even if the man rejected her, he would only be doing so reluctantly. That way, she could ride on her victory and get his number. As for the woman next to the man, she did not even spare her a look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;This kind of woman is no match for me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Even if the woman decides to go all wild and scold me, I have my ways to shame her till she has no place to hide.&rsquo;</p></div>
