        <h1>Chapter 1083</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to see Nelson. After all, he's my son, isn't he?" Martin Weiss said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately had mixed feelings. He said it so naturally. It was just like when he said he would abort the child if she was pregnant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not want her son to see their disputes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson, let's go," said Kyla Corbyn. She had to take her son back to her mother because she needed to set up her stall later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one said, "Daddy said he'll send us home today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn subconsciously wanted to refuse, but what Martin Weiss said next seemed to stop everything she wanted to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want Daddy to send you home, Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Nelson answered with his childish voice, sounding innocent and joyful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at the happy expression on her son's face, gritted her teeth, and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many parents who came to pick up their children at the kindergarten&rsquo;s gates were looking their way. Martin Weiss's glamor and Kyla Corbyn's abjection formed a sharp contrast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if they were not supposed to stand together at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was not used to the attention, or rather, she did not enjoy being watched by so many people since her release from prison! She was worried that the fact she had been to prison would reflect badly on her son if people knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then&hellip; let's go!" Kyla Corbyn hurriedly said with her head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss glanced at her, bent down, and took Nelson in his arms. He then walked toward the parking lot near the kindergarten&rsquo;s gates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver had been waiting over there. When he saw the three people approaching, he immediately opened the car door respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss took Nelson in his arms as he got in the car while Kyla Corbyn stood by the door, caught in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Get in the car," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn took a deep breath, got into the car, and sat next to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Nelson sat between them, which made Kyla Corbyn less uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one was a little excited as his little head looked left and right. He looked at Kyla Corbyn before looking at Martin Weiss. After all, having both parents sitting beside him was a novel experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, is Daddy really my daddy?" The little one's clear voice rang in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It might sound strange, but Kyla Corbyn understood what her son meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the longing in her son's eyes, she knew that he longed for a father. Whenever he saw someone playing with their father, Nelson would look wistful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She still remembered when Grace's former colleague, Chase Harper, took Nelson to the amusement park with Grace last time. Nelson had talked about how Uncle Harper gave him a ride on his shoulder, took him to play darts, and held him up to look at the amusement park's cartoon animal parade. He spoke about it for a long time after returning home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she tried hard to wear two hats as both father and mother all these years and give all her love to the child, some things could not be replaced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like... a child's longing for a father.</p></div>
