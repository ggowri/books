        <h1>Chapter 1696</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her heart still fluttered with fear at the thought of what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not because she almost died but because he almost became a murderer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She would never want him to kill someone for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It doesn't matter if I get my hands dirty. I don't care," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "But I do. Jay, your hands are beautiful and clean. I don't want you to get your hands dirty because of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes glimmered. 'My hands... They&rsquo;re already dirty but she doesn&rsquo;t know about all the dark things. But&hellip; if she wants my hands to be clean, then I'll try to give her what she wants.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He wanted to grant her whatever she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car arrived at Reed Residence. Jason and Grace got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The three children were already in Reed Residence and were having afternoon tea in the dining room. However, the three little ones looked absent-minded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as they saw Grace and Jason, they stopped what they were doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper rushed to Grace and hugged her. "Daddy, Mommy, why did you come home so late? I've been waiting for you for a long time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Didn't I tell you Daddy and I were going to the police station to tell the police what happened? We came back as soon as we were done," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed also walked over. Although he did not say anything, his little face was also full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After hugging her daughter, Grace also gave her son a big hug. "Mick, you did a great job protecting me today. That's why I'm safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed relaxed and hugged Grace back with his two small arms, feeling the warmth from his mother's embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, Mick, why don't you take Jasper to her room and play first? Daddy and I still have something to say to Wanna," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed looked at Grace and Oriel Lynch, who kept her head down and was silent. He nodded and led Jasper away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Uncle Kwan followed quickly and accompanied the two young children back to their room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Oriel Lynch, who was sitting on the chair with her head down. She said, "Wanna, your mommy... may have to stay in the police station for a while. Another woman will live with you and take care of you during this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did her best to put it mildly, not wanting Irene Lynch's incident to affect the child too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Oriel Lynch suddenly looked up and shouted at Grace, "I don't want another woman to take care of me! I just want my mommy! You stopped her from coming back, didn't you?"</p></div>
