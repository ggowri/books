        <h1>Chapter 129</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"..." What a gossip.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why don't you bring that woman over and let us meet her? I'd rather like to know what that woman looks like," Patrick suggested.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, in their circle, Jason had always been cold towards women. Even Jennifer Atkinson, who had been engaged to Jason that year, had been treated coldly. It was unprecedented for him to rush over and besiege a house with police cars in the middle of the night, just for a woman.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Patrick had heard about this, he was stunned. After the incident, he had specially called to ask.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Patrick's curiosity made Jason inexplicably unhappy. He didn't want other men to be curious about her and didn't want her to meet those people. He just wanted to have her in a place where only he could see her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Patrick and the others met her, and if she became one of their...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason knew that Patrick's group was quite popular among women, especially Brian. It seemed that any woman Brian liked would eventually become his girlfriend. Even though those women knew that the relationship would be short lived, they continued to chase him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Brian was interested in Grace... As he thought about this, Jason's heart became agitated.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Perhaps, in other people's eyes, the name "Jason" meant that he could obtain any woman he wanted. However, these three words were Grace's greatest taboo.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's just a woman. What's there to see?" he said lightly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But this woman is different. You even abandoned your Old Master for this woman," Patrick said, "Tsk tsk, I haven't seen you care so much about any woman before. Don't tell me you've fallen in love with her and want to hide her away?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more Patrick said, the more agitated Jason became. What flashed across his mind was that delicate and beautiful face. Uneasiness arose in his heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just moments ago, I was actually worried that she would fall in love with another man? Have I really fallen in love with Grace? No, that's impossible. I just liked the feeling of getting along with her."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had sworn that he would never fall in love with any woman in this lifetime!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"There's nothing different. It's just a game to kill time, I've been bored. You don't have to be too curious," he said, appearing to sound casual.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next moment, the clear sound of something falling to the ground came from behind him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instantly, his body stiffened. He turned around and saw her. Unsure of how long she had been standing there without him noticing, a feeling of fear suddenly spread in his chest before quickly enveloping his entire body.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"When...when did she come here? And how much of the conversation did she hear just now?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">For so many years, he had never felt this kind of fear. However, facing her now, it was as if he had grasped something but was unable to keep his hold on it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I said, Jason..." On the other end of the line, Patrick was still mumbling. Jason quickly ended the call.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was an endless silence between them. It was only when the cigarette between his fingers singed his hand that he put it out.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you... Jason?" Grace heard herself asking. There was no anger, no tears, no complaints. There was only... calmness.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she had pushed open the glass door and heard him say that it was just a game, that it was to kill time because he had been bored, her originally chaotic heart had suddenly calmed down.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That's right, that should be the answer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Otherwise, why would someone like Jason stay with her in the rental apartment for two months as "Jay"?</p></div>
