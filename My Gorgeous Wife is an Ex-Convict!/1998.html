        <h1>Chapter 1996</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Similarly, Monica Keller was forcing Hadwin to choose again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If... If Hadwin did choose Monica Keller, she figured she would not blame him. After all, Hadwin had done a lot for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Looks like you're trying to be the next Katherine Jackson." Hadwin Stephenson suddenly smiled. "Have you forgotten what happened to Katherine Jackson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Monica Keller's expression instantly changed, and she said, "I'm not as stupid as she. She lost the entire Jackson family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're even stupider than she is," Hadwin Stephenson said lazily as his eyes grew increasingly colder. "Since the Tang family has the nerve to conspire against me, you should be prepared to fall. Perhaps this day next year, the Tang family will no longer exist in J City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." Monica Keller's expression instantly contorted. "Hadwin Stephenson, you're too conceited."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson ignored her and left with Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they got into the car, Lina asked Hadwin Stephenson, "Are you confident about tomorrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at her and said, "We won't know who wins until the last minute. I can only say that I've done my best."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She bit her lip slightly. "Then... what happens if you lose?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I&rsquo;ll be kicked out of the board and have to leave the company. My shares will be diluted, and I might end up with no money and no power. When that happens..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"When that happens, I'll take care of you!" Lina said quickly. However, she realized she had spoken foolishly as soon as she finished speaking. Even if Hadwin Stephenson lost tomorrow, his assets far exceeded those of ordinary people. He would not need her to take care of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You'll take care of me?" He raised his eyebrow and laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her face went red. "I... I'm joking!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "I don't think it's a joke. If I lose tomorrow, then you'll take care of me. Of course, if I win tomorrow, then I'll take care of you. I'll take care of you for a lifetime!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His deep dark eyes were full of adoration. Lina looked at Hadwin Stephenson and could not help smiling. The worry in her heart seemed to gradually disperse. "Okay! Then I hope you&rsquo;ll take care of me for a lifetime!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Stephenson Group's board meeting naturally attracted a lot of attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At the board meeting, Emily Flowers and the Tang family joined hands as expected. Combined with several major shareholders and the shares they had, their portion was already five percent higher than Hadwin Stephenson's. Hadwin Stephenson would lose if there were no unexpected surprises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Monica Keller said smugly to Hadwin Stephenson, "I told you you would lose today. You had the best chance yesterday, but you didn't grasp it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Hadwin Stephenson smiled. "I think the Tang family had better stay neutral."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Are you pleading for mercy?" Monica Keller said arrogantly. She thought to herself, 'So what if he's stubborn? Isn't he still pleading for mercy in the end?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said nothing but turned on the LCD screen in the meeting room. He had the secretary connect it to the computer. A piece of breaking news about the Tang family immediately caught everyone's attention.</p></div>
