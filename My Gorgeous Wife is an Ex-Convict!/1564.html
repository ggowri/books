        <h1>Chapter 1562</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, she had to adapt to living in Reed Residence again after five years and understand how things and people had changed in the last five years... She had forgotten to think about how her daughter was probably expecting both her parents to accompany her to kindergarten, her son too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As far as she knew, Jason and their son would go out together but they would travel in two separate cars most of the time. This meant that their son was usually accompanied by the maid and driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that in mind, Grace was filled with guilt and regretted her carelessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed was a little uncomfortable being held like this. After all, he had rarely been held like this after growing up. 'But... it seems comfortable... to have Mommy hold me like this...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Will Mommy take me to kindergarten every day even if Tristas doesn't have to go...' For some reason, he was happy when he heard his mother say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On Jasper Reed's first day of kindergarten, Grace specially dressed the brother and sister in matching outfits. Looking at the two darlings of almost the same height wearing clothes and shoes of the same color, she just found them so cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The only difference was that Mick Reed was wearing pants, while Jasper was wearing a skirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace held the two kids and kissed them. Jasper was used to it. Her mother had loved kissing her since she was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Mick Reed was not used to it. Even so, he did not reject Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the mother and children kissing and hugging, there was a small curl in the corners of Jason&rsquo;s lips that even he did not realize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the family of four arrived at the kindergarten, the married couple took their two children by their hands and got out of the car. They immediately attracted the attention of many parents around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Jason rarely appeared at the kindergarten, he had been here before. This kindergarten was a famous aristocratic kindergarten in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many of Emerald City's distinguished and wealthy families would choose this kindergarten for their children, so some of them recognized Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Those who recognized Jason were shocked that Young master Reed was accompanied by not only the Reed family's Little Young Master but also a little girl and a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Some people knew that the mistress of the Reed family had come back from the dead and returned to the Reed family with a child. Now they were wondering whether Grace was the rumored mistress of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Some parents who did not recognize Jason had more or less figured out his identity. After all, Mick Reed was not an ordinary child in this kindergarten. Everyone knew that this child was the little young master of the Reed family. He was likely to inherit the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe 20 years from now, Mick Reed would be the one who ruled Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, many parents were secretly observing Mick Reed and telling their children to make friends with Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Mick Reed did not have any friends in kindergarten. Even other children had a hard time talking to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, everyone could not help speculating when they saw Jasper and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, another Porsche drove over. It was not a cheap model. The market price of this car was at least five million dollars or more. The mother and daughter of the Gregory family got out of the car.</p></div>
