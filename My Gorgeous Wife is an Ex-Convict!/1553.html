        <h1>Chapter 1551</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had also heard from Lina that Brian was devastated for a while after she &lsquo;died&rsquo;. <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>At that time, it was often reported that he would get awfully drunk and... kneel at her grave and cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Afterward, he left Emerald City, rarely returning over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As if sensing her gaze, Brian turned his head and looked at her. He shuddered, his phoenix eyes continuing to stare straight at her just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The figure he had only seen in his dreams or when he was drunk for the past few years finally appeared before him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian could hardly stand still at that moment. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It's her! She's indeed... alive. She's alive just like what Patrick said!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace..." Her name escaped Brian's mouth almost hoarsely. The next moment, he rushed toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The more he loved her, the more emotional he felt right now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as he ran over to her, he suddenly heard a young voice ask, "Mommy, who is this uncle?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The voice instantly brought him back to his senses. He realized that there was a little girl who was about four or five years old standing beside Grace. The child looked a lot like Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did not say anything, but Brian could guess that this was her child... 'She&rsquo;s one of the triplets Grace was carrying back then.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It turned out that Mick Reed was not the only one who survived; another child had too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm..." After hesitating for a while, Brian crouched down and said hoarsely, "I'm Uncle Hart. What's your name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"My name is Jasper Reed, but my original name is Jasper Reed. Uncle, you can call me Jasper," the little one said. Her almond-shaped eyes sized Brian up curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, Brian felt as if he was looking at Grace when she was a child&mdash;the strong little girl who saved him in the forest and carried him out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was the past he could never get over!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jasper? Okay, then I'll call you Jasper from now on," muttered Brian. His eyes could not help welling up with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'This is... Grace's and also Jason's child. Jasper, Jasper. Did Grace give their child this name because of Jason?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though Grace had not been by Jason's side in the past five years, she still had Jason in her heart, which was why she gave her child this name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Uncle, are you going to cry?" asked Jasper as she put her little hands on Brian's phoenix eyes. "You're not going to cry like Daddy, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one could not figure out why all the adults here liked to cry. Her father cried that day, and Uncle Hart seemed like he was going to cry now too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian's eyelashes quivered slightly, and they caught some of the tears around his eyes, making them look wet. "I'm just happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Happy?" the little one asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, I'm happy to see you and your mother. I'm so happy..." Brian started sobbing as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper was even more confused. She did not understand why he was crying if he was happy.</p></div>
