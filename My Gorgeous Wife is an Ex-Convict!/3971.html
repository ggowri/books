        <h1>Chapter 3969</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Clarissa is in jail now, so you can rest assured. I finally did what I promised you, and made Clarissa pay the price she deserves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From the beginning, I was using Mick, because I couldn't make Clarissa pay the price on my own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's body suddenly stiffened, his eyes fixed on Irene's phone. He was very familiar with Nancy's voice and could immediately recognize it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the words on the phone made him feel uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on with this voice?" Mick asked Irene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I secretly recorded it! This is indeed what Nancy said, without any falsehood. If you need it, I can give you the original recording, and you can have it verified by a professional organization," Irene said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her method was to install a small device with recording and video functions in the teddy bear she gave Nancy as an apology gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, she wanted to catch Nancy doing something embarrassing, but she didn't capture anything inappropriate. Instead, she recorded these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these are enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could the pride of the Reed family tolerate being deceived by others!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy is just a fraud. She has been deceiving you from beginning to end. She is only with you to use you against the Schultz family!" Irene's expression began to distort, "Mick, you are too confident in your intelligence, but you didn't expect to be deceived by a woman, especially an ordinary woman like her... Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene's voice suddenly stopped because the other party's hand had already pinched her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Mick's cold voice sounded, and his black eyes were filled with a cold and dead silence, "If you say another word, you're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, every hair on Irene's body stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a kind of chilling fear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy came alone to her mother's grave, lit incense, offered fruits and the food she made herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps until now, she had truly accepted the fact that her mother had left her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, unlike the despair she felt when she first came here, she now felt a kind of uneasiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, when I go back later, I will go to Mick and tell him everything. Whether he is willing to forgive me or not, I will accept the result willingly." Nancy murmured, "Mom, I... I like </span><span>him. Although I didn't like him at first, I think I like him now. He is probably the best person to me in this world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused and looked at her mother's tombstone, "Mom, if you have a spirit in heaven, please bless me... I hope he can forgive my past deception, and I hope we can have a good result."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gentle breeze brushed her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, until the incense was extinguished, Nancy left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she reached the entrance of the cemetery, she froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure stood at the entrance, looking particularly clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was not a traditional day for visiting graves, so the cemetery was deserted.</span></p></div>
