        <h1>Chapter 2197</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"By the way, what's your name?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Chandler Hunter." The boy did not hide it from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Tina Stephenson enjoyed being burped and fell asleep soon after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy reluctantly returned Tina Stephenson to the maid, got up, and said, "Well, goodbye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you going home alone? Shall I take you home?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "That's not necessary. Someone will pick him up. Don't worry, he's very important to his family!" Last time, she tried to send him back, but she saw a row of cars parked at the gate. They were there just to... pick up the heir of the Hunter family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was probably a row of cars parked outside her house by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After Chandler Hunter left, Grace asked Lina, "By the way, have you found out who&rsquo;s the culprit behind the toxin injection?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin said he found some clues. He just has to make sure," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where is he? Is he out today?" Speaking of Hadwin Stephenson, Grace just remembered she had not seen Hadwin Stephenson even though she had arrived for quite some time. Today was a weekend, and Hadwin Stephenson would usually be at home with Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He had to go out of the country for business. He&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow or the day after," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At this moment, Hadwin Stephenson, who the two people were talking about, walked up to an old castle. The old castle's security guard was Asian, and he knew him. As soon as he saw him, he respectfully opened the door and said to him, "Mr. Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where's Old Madam?" Hadwin Stephenson asked with a straight face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Old Madam has gone to a party and may not be back for a while," the security guard said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson walked into the old castle. He sat on the couch in front of the fireplace and looked blankly at the fireplace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This was previously his home where he and his mother lived together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Back then in front of the old castle's fireplace, his father had wanted to bring him back to the Stephenson family. His mother hugged him tightly and said to his father with tears in her eyes, "This is my son. I have nothing left but him. He's everything to me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At that time, he thought that he was everything to his mother, but he and his mother obviously had different understandings of the word &lsquo;everything&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was probably destined that the mother and son got to where they were now. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson slowly closed his eyes and waited quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sometime later, footsteps were heard. Just then, a female voice rang out. "What's the matter? Have you found time to visit your mother? I thought you had forgotten your mother after getting a wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The sarcastic voice belonged to Emily Flowers.</p></div>
