        <h1>Chapter 3468</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You broke up with me not because you fell in love with someone else, but because... the Reed family can offer you a business deal, right?" Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's face changed and he wanted to deny it, but at that moment his mind went blank and he couldn't say a word of denial. All the words got stuck in his throat and he couldn't utter a single one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica gave a bitter smile, and Daniel's angry response was telling her that it was true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why? Is money really that important?" She said bitterly, feeling a lump in her throat and her eyes stinging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm... I'm sorry!" Daniel muttered for a while before finally saying, "Veronica, I'm sorry. I know I've let our relationship down, but I can't help it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of my father's corruption, if we didn't do this, he would have gone to jail!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for these reasons, he couldn't say it out loud at the moment. Perhaps it was to preserve his father's dignity, or maybe it was to save his own last shred of dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No way? What's so impossible about it? It's just my mistaken feelings, which are less important than a business deal!" Veronica sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her lips were smiling, but tears were shining in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Daniel felt his heart ache to the extreme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Veronica didn't look at him again, instead she turned her head and looked at Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why?" This time, she asked him why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's face was pale, his beautiful eyes fixed on Veronica, "Because I love Veronica, more than anyone else in this world!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Love?" A mist covered her eyes, "Mason, how could you do this? Do you love me, or are you treating my feelings like goods to be traded with others?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice was choked, and there was an indescribable pain on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she broke up with Daniel, it was Mason who accompanied her and made her feel less painful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has always been grateful for having a good brother! Without him, she would have suffered much more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, reality has dealt her the heaviest blow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turns out that all her pain was caused by him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He decided the outcome of her breakup, and then appeared before her to comfort her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she, foolishly, was immensely grateful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is there anything more ridiculous than this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Veronica felt that Mason in front of her was so unfamiliar, even though they were only a few steps away from each other, it felt like they were separated by thousands of miles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I once told Veronica not to fall in love with someone else, Veronica, do you remember?" Mason walked towards Veronica step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was suddenly stunned... she remembered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was more than a year ago when he said those words to her, but later on, she started dating Daniel and he never mentioned it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought that it was just his young age and possessiveness as a child that made him say such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, she thought he had forgotten about these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it is clear that she underestimated Mason's feeling of "exclusivity" towards her.</p></div>
