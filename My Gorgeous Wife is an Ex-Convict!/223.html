        <h1>Chapter 222</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, what she thought was a secret was now exposed by him in such a straightforward and simple way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know why I didn't expose you before? Because it doesn't matter to me. You work so hard to act in front of me. I have to pay you some compensation, don&rsquo;t I?" he said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked stunned. Her face turned from pale to red as if someone had slapped her several times. It hurt and embarrassed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, I don't like people who act too much and take themselves too seriously." Brian's face darkened as he pulled the two million dollar watch off Evelyn's wrist and fiddled with it. "I can make you a star, but that doesn't mean you can do whatever you want. Otherwise, the bigger a star I make out of you, the harder you'll fall."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he finished his sentence, his fingers loosened. The watch fell heavily to the ground, causing fine cracks to appear on its surface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn gasped. Her body stiffened with fright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, you don't have to go to tonight's party anymore," Brian said before walking out of the lounge. Evelyn did not even have a chance to explain herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn looked at the watch on the floor in confusion. It was worth more than two million dollars. It was the first time in her life that she had worn such an expensive watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had dropped it just like that! Was he telling her that he could always do the same to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if the people outside praised her to the sky, to him, she was just something he could throw away at any time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's hands that were at her sides were clenched into fists. She held Grace accountable for all this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The party tonight was a gathering for Emerald City's top elites. She had been looking forward to the party tonight and even specially ordered a dress from France to be flown in by air with the hope of impressing those elites tonight. It was a good opportunity for her to raise her popularity as well as build connections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, because of Grace, she was unable to go to her party tonight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace would have to pay her back for this sooner or later!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, Emerald City's top elites' parties also attracted several journalists, but not all journalists could enter such parties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, many journalists had to barricade themselves in front of the hall's entrance to see if they could get anything of value.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A fleet of luxury cars kept stopping at the hall's entrance. The people getting down from these cars were, of course, all celebrities from all walks of life in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a black Bentley stopped in front of the hall's entrance. A few experienced journalists, after seeing the license plate, knew who it was immediately and put down their cameras without even being told to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the man never liked being photographed by journalists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of the journalists who did not know any better took a full face photo of the man and posted it online. As a result, the photo was deleted, and the journalist lost his job. He could no longer stay in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a popular saying among the journalists that they should not simply take photos of Jason. Even if you took one by accident, you should not publish it or put it on the internet. You could only take a picture of his back. He would not go after you if that was the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Bentley's door was opened, and a tall figure stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd was wowed.</p></div>
