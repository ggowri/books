        <h1>Chapter 863</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Chase Harper and the excited Nelson who were both beside her, Grace was too embarrassed to say no in front of the child. As such, she nodded her head and agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three of them went to the amusement park together. On the way, Chase Harper initiated a conversation with Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was unexpectedly friendly to Chase Harper, especially when Chase Harper talked about the toys he played with when he was a child. Nelson's eyes sparkled, and he excitedly asked him about some toys from that era that he had never heard of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at the amusement park, the three went to the ticket window to buy tickets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson looked at a little girl sitting on her father's shoulder in another line next to them. She was looking left and right, enjoying herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace noticed that Nelson had been looking at the little girl and her father for a long while now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that Nelson was brought up by Kyla and Mrs. Corbyn. He only met his birth father, Martin Weiss, once. Nelson thought he had no father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having a father holding him high while he rode on his shoulders was something he had never experienced before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the little one was looking at the little girl with envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was thinking about buying something for him to distract his attention, but the next moment, she saw Chase Harper bending down and saying to Nelson, "Here, how about I give you a ride on my shoulders too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he lifted the little one and let him ride on his shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at Chase Harper's actions with surprise. The man was more attentive than she thought. He had noticed Nelson's envy for the little girl, so he let Nelson ride on his shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm so high up, Aunty!" Nelson's excited voice rang, and Grace's eyes moved to the small, smiling face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly felt that it was a good idea to come to the amusement park with Nelson and Chase Harper today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson had a good time at the amusement park today. When the sun went down, Chase Harper drove the car while Nelson fell asleep in Grace's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for today," said Grace. Today, Chase Harper was like a temporary father figure. Chase Harper had even accompanied Nelson to play some father-child games.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson had a great time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps the presence of a father was really important to the development of a child, especially for boys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... thinking of Martin Weiss's relationship with Kyla, Grace sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I had a great time today, and thank you for letting me go to the amusement park with you," Chase Harper said with a chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip and said, "Well... I made it very clear to you last time that I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know!" Chase Harper quickly interrupted Grace and said, "I know you don't have any feelings for me. You can rest assured that I won't cross the line. However, I have no intention of changing my feelings toward you... Not for the time being."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing will come of it." Grace sighed. He was a good man, so she did not want him to waste his time on her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You won't know if you haven't tried." Chase Harper smiled shyly, but there was a rare persistence in his smile. "You don't need to give me any response. I'll give you my blessing when you meet someone you like one day."</p></div>
