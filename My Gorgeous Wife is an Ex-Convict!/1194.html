        <h1>Chapter 1193</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't get it. Set him up? What would be in it for me?" asked Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was what Grace was wondering about. "You don't even want to settle, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you like to settle with a man who wanted to rape you?" asked Stella, almost admiring the grim expression on Grace's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, she felt like she had the upper hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath. "'Have you ever thought about how you're going to stigmatize a man for the rest of his life by doing this? He won't be able to hold his head up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, don't keep on saying that I set Chase Harper up. You're also a lawyer. You should know that you have to show evidence for everything!" Stella said proudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What can I do for you to let Chase Harper go?" Grace took a deep breath and said, "Just name it, and I'll do what I can."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she did not understand Stella's intention, she had a feeling that it had something to do with her! Maybe it was because of her that Stella framed Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if I want you to stop being a lawyer henceforth?" Stella scoffed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace replied flatly. If Chase Harper was unjustly put in prison because of her, she would have gone against the justice in her heart even if she could become a lawyer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was the point of being a lawyer like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she not want to be a lawyer when she was a teenager because she wanted to get real justice for more people?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'd give up being a lawyer for Chase Harper?" The voice that should have sounded elegant rang behind her with an incredulous coldness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head and saw that Brian had returned to the ward. His handsome face was full of surprise, disbelief, and even faint anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian never expected to hear Grace say that. He was just a former colleague at the Sanitation Service Center. Was it worth it for her to do all these for that man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want him to be charged with something he didn't do," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you believe him so much even when all the evidence points to him?" he asked as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As I said before at the police station, he's my friend, and I believe him," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only felt a sharp pain in his chest. He remembered the results of the investigation he had asked his men to do. Chase Harper used to have a crush on Grace when they were at the Sanitation Service Center. He even had the people at the Sanitation Service Center put in a good word because he wanted to date Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What about her? Was that man just a friend to her? Or maybe... there was a deeper concern?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, a wave of jealousy filled his body. He knew she had never promised him anything, and he did not even have the right to be jealous, but he could not restrain himself. "If I ask you not to participate and interfere in this case, would you... say yes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was an almost imperceptible quiver in his voice as he said this, and his hands that were by his sides trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was gambling on how important Chase Harper was in her heart!</p></div>
