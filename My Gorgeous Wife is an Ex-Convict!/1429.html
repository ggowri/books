        <h1>Chapter 1428</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Smack!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The loud slap made Paisley Daniels stop her speech short and she almost fell to the ground again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One side of her cheek instantly became red and swollen as a slap print appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Paisley Daniels seemed to feel no pain and said sarcastically, "Even if Kyla Corbyn lives to have her name cleared, she won&rsquo;t stay alive for long. Martin Weiss, I'd like to see what you&rsquo;ll look like when Kyla Corbyn dies!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss immediately narrowed his eyes and stared at Paisley Daniels. "How do you know she's sick?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels laughed wildly. "Haha. How do I know? I know everything about Kyla Corbyn better than you do! Martin Weiss, you're blind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's thin lips were almost pressed into a straight line. He clenched his teeth. A long time passed before he finally said, "You're right. I am blind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was blind to have been deceived for so long and not know who was the one who had his best interests at heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, he deserved all this punishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Paisley Daniels, I was blind, and my heart was blind. I'll pay for my sins, while you and the Daniels family will also be doomed to spend your whole lives in prison to pay for your sins!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, Martin Weiss turned to leave. It was as if he was tired of looking at these people in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels smiled miserably and still shouted like a lunatic, "Martin Weiss, I'm waiting for Kyla Corbyn to die and see how you'll end up..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not until Martin Weiss got back in the car and closed the door that Paisley Daniels's crazy shrill voice seemed to be cut off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He closed his eyes slowly and ordered the driver in front of him, "Go to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As the car slowly drove away, he leaned back in his chair like an old man who was in his remaining days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla&rsquo;s liver cancer is at stage three now. Only by having liver replacement surgery can we have a glimmer of hope. Martin Weiss, if you want to redeem yourself, then cut half of your liver and give it to Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's words echoed in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Half of my liver? I'd give her everything if she wanted them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I know... I know what stage three cancer means! So her painful symptoms were because her cancer is progressing and getting worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That's why she suddenly stopped fighting and was willing to give me Nelson's custody.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That's why she complied with my request to kneel in front of Paisley Daniels and apologize. It was to fulfill Nelson's amusement park wish!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why did I make that request?' Martin Weiss hated himself immensely when he thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Kyla probably thought this request was ridiculous. She, as the victim, had to apologize to the person who framed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'However, I've done such ridiculous things more than once!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'When she asked me at the amusement park if I would save her if she were going to die... What did I answer her then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I told her not to die in front of me and irritate my eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How could I have said that? My words destroyed all her hope of surviving!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Yet she was the one who gave me my life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss began trembling while he clenched his teeth.</p></div>
