        <h1>Chapter 636</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&rdquo;Is this man really mine?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without realizing it, she uttered the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she heard his voice say, "Yes, I'm yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound was so lovely that it was almost divine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her lips just fell on his lips as she kissed him! 'If he's mine, then... I can kiss him any way I want!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the bar, the woman still looked traumatized about what had just happened to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who the hell... Is that man? He seems unusual with bodyguards protecting him.' When the man named Jason finally left while holding the drunk woman in his arms, she saw the wristwatch he was wearing. It was a limited edition watch of a famous brand she had seen on the internet before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that there were only three in the world and it cost hundreds of millions of dollars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe she was wrong, or maybe the man was just wearing a knockoff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... What if the man is wearing the real thing?' The woman's heart suddenly stopped at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If that man named Jason is wearing a watch worth hundreds of millions of dollars, then... What kind of man is he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who&hellip; The hell is he?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason got into the car with Grace in his arms. She was now blushing, her almond-shaped eyes visibly intoxicated but were still as bright as stars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fingers were still feeling his cheek as she got in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay..." she mumbled. The smell of alcohol became more pronounced when she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would have hated her if she were a stranger, but he liked the smell of alcohol on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm? What's wrong, haven't you had enough?" he asked dotingly as he gently pushed aside the hair on her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head. "Enough. That's enough... I just want to eat... Eat..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want to eat? I'll have someone buy it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she grinned. "I want to eat you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes suddenly darkened. Did she know what it meant for her to look like this and say such things? For men, it was seduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In that case, you mustn't tell this to any other man except me, all right?" he said, feeling the desire in his body awakening at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... Don't want to eat anyone else. It's just that Jay... Looks... Delicious," she stuttered, her almond-shaped eyes fixed on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt really good when she kissed him just now. It was like eating something delicious, making her want to kiss him again...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, Grace put her lips on Jason's and kissed him deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pried open his lips and teeth with the tip of her tongue, trying to kiss him more deeply. She was trying to &lsquo;eat&rsquo; him more thoroughly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Jason let out an almost desirous crooning from his throat, then opened his lips to allow the tip of her tongue to squeeze into his mouth.</p></div>
