        <h1>Chapter 726</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly washed up and left for the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she did not know was that when the tip of her foot had just stepped out of Reed Residence, someone was already reporting her whereabouts to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed, Miss Cummins has left the house," said Terrence in the president's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his eyelids, his long black eyelashes quivering slightly. "All right, I got it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After that, there was absolute silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Terrence's body shivered. Young Master Reed was so quiet that he only found it&hellip; Dreadful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got to the hospital, took a number, and soon met Dr. Leng.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a 40-something female doctor and was a little chubby. Her smiling eyes gave people a sense of familiarity that made people let down their guards easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps, people who looked like this were more suited to be psychiatrists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat down and told her about her symptoms, and that her dreams seemed to be happening more frequently recently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially... After meeting Brian at the fair, she started having these dreams again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's highly possible that it's amnesia. If it's just as you said, it happened because someone else has told you the same thing. As you put yourself into it at night, it's unlikely to keep on happening. Probably only once in a while at most," Dr. Leng said analytically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Amnesia&hellip;' Although she had speculated about this possibility herself, hearing it from a professional psychiatrist made her heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If the dream is really my memory, then Brian and I&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Leng's voice interrupted her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, I got distracted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to know if it's your memory, then indeed, hypnosis is more appropriate. After all, as you said, you've had a lot of continuous dreams, and the contents of these dreams can be very convenient for me to guide you. With luck, you'll be able to recover your memory," said Dr. Leng.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's... It?" Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Leng said with a smile, "Your case is really simple because you already have a series of dreams, so you just need a little guidance. Of course, if it's not amnesia, I&rsquo;ll look for another cause of your illness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Dr. Leng added, "If you're in a hurry to recover your memory, I can do a hypnosis session for you tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Tomorrow?' Grace felt a sudden surge of unease from the bottom of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she walked out of Dr. Leng's office, she was a little dazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I can solve the problem that has been troubling me&hellip; Tomorrow?' It was so fast that she could not believe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... She was suddenly a little afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Images of Brian persistently grabbing her hand and asking her who she was and Jay's lonely figure that stood in front of his father's memorial tablet flashed in front of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I'm really the little girl who saved Brian when he was little, how should I face this fact?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is there going to be any trouble with Brian again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Would Jason be upset? I was even thinking about how to make him feel more secure before I went out today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What about Stella?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat in a chair in the hospital corridor, her mind in turmoil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not far from the hospital, Jason sat in the back of a black car parked in the shadows while he stared at the hospital's main entrance.</p></div>
