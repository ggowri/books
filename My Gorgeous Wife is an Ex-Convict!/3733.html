        <h1>Chapter 3731</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be... this is the car that Mason sent to pick her up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, the person who got out of the car seemed to confirm her guess. It was the Reed family's driver, whom she knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Barlow, Mason sent me to pick you up," the driver said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica smiled awkwardly, "Then... let's get in the car first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the car had already attracted the attention of others at the school gate. Many students who were coming and going were looking at the car, and many people were also looking at Veronica and the driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two got into the car, and the car slowly drove away from the campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Shirley and other classmates witnessed the scene. Someone couldn't help but ask, "Who was that person just now? He came to pick up Veronica in a luxury car! I remember Veronica always worked hard and had a job. Her family shouldn't have money, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be her relative?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whose relative would come to pick someone up in such a luxury car? This car is a global limited edition, and it costs at least ten million yuan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So expensive? Ten million yuan? Oh my god, that's like having a villa on the road."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The person who got out of the car just now looked almost 40 years old. Veronica always talks about working hard, could it be that she's doing some 'special' work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley couldn't stand it anymore, "Have you guys had enough? Making these kinds of guesses about a girl is terrible! It's just someone coming to pick up Veronica, it's not a big deal. Veronica is working at a talent agency now, maybe a celebrity asked the driver to pick her up on the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica is just doing odd jobs, right? Would a celebrity ask a driver to pick up someone doing odd jobs in a luxury car?" someone retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows what kind of shady business Veronica is doing in private!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley couldn't stand it anymore, "Okay, fine. I believe that Veronica is definitely not that kind of person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't know how to explain the scene just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver drove Veronica to the entrance of the city library.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason is in the VIP room on the third floor. After Miss Barlow goes in, someone will take her there," the driver said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, thank you," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked into the library, a staff member greeted her and, after confirming her name, led her to the VIP room on the third floor before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica stood at the door, surprised that their first date after reuniting was at the library.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lightly knocked on the door and slowly pushed it open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of her was a familiar figure sitting in a chair with an open book on his desk. At that moment, his handsome face turned towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're here," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you wait long?" she asked, feeling a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not really, I can always use this time to do some research," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, you didn't have to send a driver to pick me up in that car," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't like that kind of car?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a bit too attention-grabbing," she said. The car had been a focal point when it arrived at the school gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then which car from my family do you like to be picked up in?" he asked.</span></p></div>
