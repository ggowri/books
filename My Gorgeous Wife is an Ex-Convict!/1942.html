        <h1>Chapter 1940</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Were you afraid that... you wouldn&rsquo;t survive the process of lifting the blood curse, so you said nothing to me for fear that I would be too devastated?" asked Lina. She finally figured out the real reason he was so hesitant at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Instead of answering Lina's question, Hadwin Stephenson said, "What was waiting when I could escape from death and finally remove the blood curse on me? You were the one in the hospital trying to abort the baby, saying you didn't have feelings for me and wouldn't love me anymore!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Every word he said seemed like a slap in the face and was slicing her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry. I'm sorry..." Lina sobbed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You don't have to apologize to me. It's as meaningless as how you're telling me you love me," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's hand was still on Hadwin Stephenson's cheek. One hand was not enough, so she added another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's not true. If I have disappointed you, then I'll earn your trust again. Hadwin, please. Just give me a chance, okay? Just once!" Lina begged him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He slowly looked down to hide the flickering struggle in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She always did this. She could easily make his mood fluctuate with some begging and crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"A chance? How do you want me to give you a chance?" Hadwin Stephenson asked after a long while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let's spend time together like we used to. Only one month. I only want one month! If you still won't forgive me and be with me after a month, then I&rsquo;ll leave you and stop bothering you. But I hope you won't avoid me during this one month," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"A month?" Hadwin Stephenson sneered. "How can I believe that you&rsquo;ll give up and stop bothering me after a month?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I can write you a guarantee letter!" Lina quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"A guarantee letter has no effect in law." Hadwin Stephenson rejected it bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then..." Lina was troubled now. Even trying to make him believe her had become so difficult now. "Then I'll swear with my own life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at him with an expression of unmatched determination, she said, "I swear with my life that I'll leave if you still won't be with me after a month. I won't show up in front of you of my own accord from then on! If I fail to do this, then after I give birth, I'll&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson suddenly interrupted her before she could finish swearing. "Okay, one month! You&rsquo;ll return to Emerald City and never show up in front of me again after a month."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina let out a long sigh of relief even though she was not quite satisfied with what Hadwin Stephenson said. He spoke as if he was confident they would not get back together after a month, but at least he agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, then... you have to answer my calls during this month and tell the security guards downstairs, as well as your secretary, not to stop me whenever I come to see you." Lina began to ramble on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson turned his head away and walked over to his desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even he could not believe that he had consented to her ridiculous request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'A month? Does she think she's playing some love game?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he could not help shuddering at the thought of the last part of her swear that she was about to say. For a moment, he was afraid she might make some blood oath.</p></div>
