        <h1>Chapter 2532</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her hand was a bracelet that Herman had given her before he was about to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, he said, "Amber Mitchell, I don't think I'm going to your wedding. This is my wedding gift to you. I hope you&rsquo;ll be the most beautiful bride at the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Bride... Yeah, I will one day be a bride and... put on this bracelet.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Herman..." Amber Mitchell murmured as her eyes got wet again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a voice suddenly rang in her ears. "What's the matter? Do you miss Herman Moss that much? Would you marry him if he were alive?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell paused and instantly looked up at George Gregory, who had stood in front of her at one point. He was dressed in a suit and tie, looking elegant and noble. However, his handsome face was gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. I would marry Herman in a heartbeat if he were still alive!" she answered without hesitation. She only regretted that the man who loved her deeply lost his life trying to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the one who died first!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her statement seemed to trigger George Gregory, and his face became increasingly gloomy as he approached her. He said, "It seems that you're passionately devoted to him. It's my fault for hindering you two."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell frowned. "George Gregory, what are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, what am I trying to do?' Even George Gregory had no idea what he was trying to do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just saw her standing there, so he could not help getting out of the car and walking up to her. Then, jealousy welled up in his chest when he heard her murmur the name &lsquo;Herman&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The jealousy was so intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so intense that he was startled and amused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was still jealous of Herman Moss after all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes fell on the diamond bracelet Amber Mitchell was holding. It was a diamond bracelet, and it looked expensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not remember Amber Mitchell ever owning a bracelet like that. There was also no way Amber Mitchell would buy such a bracelet in her current situation either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell had not reclaimed her shares in Mitchell Group. Jason's wife, Grace, even rented the house she was currently staying in. How could she possibly afford a bracelet that might be worth up to tens of millions of dollars?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A possibility suddenly flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did Herman Moss give you this bracelet?" he blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell froze, and her expression stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory instantly knew he was right. The jealousy in his heart spread all throughout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he did something beyond his expectation. He snatched the bracelet from her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing?" Amber Mitchell was surprised and tried to grab the bracelet, but it was too late. George Gregory had already gotten the bracelet, and her hand missed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you care so much about what Herman Moss gave you?" George Gregory asked coldly.</p></div>
