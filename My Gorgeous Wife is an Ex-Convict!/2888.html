        <h1>Chapter 2886</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland: [I said you were living with Brian now. Then they said nothing and left readily.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland: [Did you block their phone numbers? They said you're not answering your phone.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller: [Yeah.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should have blocked her uncle's family's phone numbers long ago. Even blocking them now was considered late!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland: [Well done! But didn&rsquo;t they try calling you using another phone number?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller: [They did. But as soon as they spoke and I heard their voices, I hung up and blocked their phone numbers.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, she did not give them a chance to talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to listen to what they had to say anyway. They had worn out the last of her affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland: [Have you made up your mind this time?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller: [I&rsquo;ll just consider that my grandparents only gave birth to my father!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, she no longer considered her uncle and his family her family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland: [You should have done that long ago! They told me Brian's suing them. That cousin of yours came to me today crying, saying that he was going to be charged with endangering public safety, causing trouble, intentional injury... There's a bunch, and he might get imprisoned for up to ten years if he's unlucky!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze and looked up to the other side of the study. Brian was in front of his computer, dealing with his company matters. He felt Valda Theller's gaze and immediately turned his head around while asking, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you meet my uncle's family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian replied truthfully, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you suing them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, of course. Shouldn't your uncle's family get what they deserve for what they&rsquo;ve done to you? Or do you want to plead mercy for them?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "No, I'm not going to plead for them. They deserve whatever they're getting. But why didn't you mention this to me? If my uncle's family hadn't gone to look for Camille and Camille didn&rsquo;t tell me, I wouldn&rsquo;t know you had met them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hesitation flickered in Brian's eyes. He did not tell her because the humiliation she suffered that day at the comic fiesta was because of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross wanted to embarrass her, so she bribed her uncle's family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He feared that knowing this fact would make her dislike him even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was silence in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments Later, Valda Theller said, "Forget it if you don't want to talk about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Phoebe Cross gave Wynne three million dollars. Phoebe Cross instructed Wynne to do that to you. She also arranged many people to cause a scene to attack and insult you.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phoebe Cross?" Valda Theller recalled her appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And she did it because&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know why." She interrupted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know?" He was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She loves you, so it's not surprising that she wants to lay a hand on me," said Valda Theller. She knew Phoebe Cross loved him when she first met her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was silent for a long time before saying, "I've never had romantic feelings for her. She's just someone I've known since childhood."</p></div>
