        <h1>Chapter 936</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wanted to see you, so I didn&rsquo;t care about the time. Hadwin, I think I'm lucky that our feelings are mutual," she said, her voice sounding sweet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to Grace, she was much luckier, and therefore, she felt even more sorry for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you say that all of a sudden?" Hadwin looked at the person in front of him. He was pleased to hear these words from her, but he could not understand why she was saying these all of a sudden as if she had gotten inspired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I went to see Grace today. She said she and Jason are back to being brothers and sisters again because of some things. I know Grace wants to get over Jason, but this situation will only make it worse," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said angrily after a pause, "I don't know what Jason is thinking. He seems to care about Grace a lot, but he's the one who wanted to break up with Grace. They all said women are unpredictable, but I think he's the unpredictable one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason is still in love with Grace," Hadwin said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Lina was stunned. "He's still in love with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." He had seen the way Jason looked at Grace after breaking up. As a man, he could feel that Jason's feelings for Grace were not over at all. Instead, it was... bordering on madness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why did he want to break up? He said he was tired and wanted to stop loving her!" Lina asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll have to ask him this." Hadwin rubbed Lina's forehead. "Alright, don't get involved in other people's business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Other people? It's Grace!" Lina frowned disapprovingly. 'Grace and the others are not the same. We're besties, even sisters!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes!" answered Hadwin, knowing how important Grace was to the woman. Even Hadwin would often get jealous because of that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suspected that if one day he and Grace fell into the water at the same time, the girl would not hesitate to save Grace first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin, let's not break up for no reason, alright?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only found it awkward. 'What does she mean by breaking up for no reason? We can never break up!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you forgotten? I told you that if we&rsquo;re really dating, then we would never break up! Lina, if you dare break up with me, you're dead meat!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina finally recalled it. 'We made a promise never to break up at the beginning of our relationship!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hehe!" She smiled, then moved her hands from his waist to his neck before wrapping them around to make him bend down a little. She stood on her tiptoes and kissed him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This kiss was spontaneous and passionate. All of a sudden, his eyes darkened as he opened his mouth to respond to her kiss&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only one he allowed to do as she pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once the kiss was over, Lina wanted more. Her round cat-like eyes stared at Hadwin. Licking her lips, she said, "I think we can have a deeper kiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raising his eyebrows, he looked at her. "Do you know what happens when you kiss a man in the middle of the night like this?" He was not rational enough to maintain his self-control after her &lsquo;deep&rsquo; kisses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even had to desperately restrain himself from pinning her down on the bed during the kiss earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked, then blushed as if she understood what he meant. However, after a moment's hesitation, she stood on her tiptoes and wanted to go in for a kiss again. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His long fingers touched her lips, and the tips of their noses were almost touching. He asked hoarsely, "Aren't you afraid?"</p></div>
