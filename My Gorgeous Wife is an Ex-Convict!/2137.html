        <h1>Chapter 2135</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, the little boy said to the man in his 40s who was following him, "Uncle Andy, I'd like to go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, shall we go, then?" the man called Uncle Andy replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two turned around to leave, and Jason's voice rang faintly. "I'm so sorry, but you can't leave today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Are you going to stop us?" Uncle Andy asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," Jason said bluntly as he looked at the little boy, "You said you refuse. So it's not that you can't save Lina but it's because you won't save her, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy glared at Jason as he pressed his little pink lips together tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then tell me what it&rsquo;ll take for you to save her?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're dreaming if you think you can ask our young master to save someone irrelevant. If she wasn&rsquo;t pregnant with..." Uncle Andy seemed to realize something and immediately stopped speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy's childish yet cold voice rang out. "I won't save her. What does it matter to me whether this woman lives or dies?" With that said, he said to the man beside him again, "Uncle Andy, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, they had only taken a few steps when a group of people suddenly gathered around them and blocked their way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">These people were obviously Jason's men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Are you trying to overwhelm us with numbers? Jason, didn't the elders of the Reed family tell you not to touch the Hunter family?" Uncle Andy snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes narrowed instantly. 'The Hunter family...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Speaking of which, Old master Reed had mentioned &lsquo;the Hunter family&rsquo; before. It was a secretive family. If the Reed family was out in the open, the Hunter family was in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even Old master Reed could not say for sure how powerful the Hunter family was, but he once warned him not to have any conflict with the Hunter family unless necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, but so what?" Jason smiled faintly. Old master Reed had said &lsquo;unless necessary&rsquo;, and it was necessary now. If Lina did fall into a vegetative state, then Grace would probably never be happy again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All he wanted to do was make Grace happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you trying to make an enemy out of the Hunter family?" Uncle Andy's eyes flickered with surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason knew about the Hunter family but still dared to stop them. Lina, the person in the coma, was no one important to Jason. She was only a friend of Jason's wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If your young master resolutely refuses to save Lina, then maybe we can only be enemies," Jason said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jason, do you really think you rule Emerald City? Don't underestimate the Hunter family!" said Uncle Andy as his face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then what if the Weiss family joins in?" said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla, who had been silent, looked at Martin Weiss in surprise. She did not expect Martin Weiss to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Uncle Andy looked a little grimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They reached a stalemate. Just then, Hadwin Stephenson came in holding the baby. He came up to the little boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The tiny baby was sleeping soundly.</p></div>
