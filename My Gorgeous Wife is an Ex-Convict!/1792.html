        <h1>Chapter 1790</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together. "If he had gotten over you, he wouldn't have brought up reincarnation.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "He probably just said that for peace of mind. Who knows if we'll reincarnate?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What if there is? Would you be willing to give him a chance to be with you in your next life?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you jealous?" she quipped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, I'm jealous." His expression was deadly serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace froze. Then, she pulled herself together and said earnestly, "If we do reincarnate, I hope I'll still meet you. I'm not the one Brian is meant to be with. He'll meet a woman who's worthy of his love and loves him back someday!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyelashes quivered a little as he raised his hand to embrace her, gently brushing his cheek against hers. "Then in our next lives, I&rsquo;ll meet you as soon as I can and try my best to protect you so that you won't suffer in the slightest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His gentle voice flowed through her heart like a warm stream. Grace smiled sweetly. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If they did have next lives, she hoped they would meet earlier as he had said. There would be fewer twists and turns and more happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's operation was scheduled for nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell was in charge of the operation, and he was accompanied in the operating room by two specialists from Emerald City. In addition, there was also a team of specialists outside the operating room. They would be watching the live recording while analyzing the situation. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They had prepared a total of three methods. They were trying to be as safe as possible, so to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina and Kyla arrived at the hospital as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla looked at Grace and said, "Why didn't you tell me about this? If I hadn't called Lina, I would have had no idea you&rsquo;re having an operation today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "I didn't want you to worry. I wanted to tell you after the operation was successful. What about your store?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla said, "My mother will keep an eye on it, so it's okay. But I heard from Lina that Mason is the child you lost. What a coincidence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, it is!" At the mention of her son, Grace's face lit up with joy. After the operation, she wanted to have a good look at Mason and hug him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She owed the child so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was nine o&rsquo;clock in the twinkling of an eye. Grace was calm, but Jason looked uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, it's just an operation. Don't worry. We have so many specialists around!" Grace comforted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, with so many specialists around, your hands will be alright," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if it does fail, it doesn't matter. Now that technology is so advanced, we'll think of other ways. Besides, there are so many things I can do even without my hands," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't Jayx it. Your hands... will be alright!" said Jason. He had never been a superstitious man, but he was afraid that she would Jayx herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The more one cared, the more careful one became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When it was time for the operation, Grace was wheeled into the operating room while Lina, Kyla, and Jason stood guard outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence, who was beside Jason, approached Lina and Kyla. He said, "The operation today will be long, so you may go back first. I'll let you know when it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
