        <h1>Chapter 2010</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a direct threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The class teacher hurriedly gave them all sorts of compliments. After all, the person in front of them was the school's VIP. Every year, they would donate millions to the school. Even the principal was respectful to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If they did join forces with other parents to go on strike, the class teacher would be in trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The class teacher knew exactly what was going on, so they said to Kyla, "Nelson Corbyn's mom, hurry and apologize to them. Or I will have to tell the principal that your child is unfit to study here and you&rsquo;ll have to transfer schools."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla held her son in her arms but felt disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew better than anyone else how hard it was to send her child to a regular school. Her son should have been a blessed child with good health, but because of her... he had to suffer at a young age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now... he was even being forced to apologize!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once he apologized, it would be tantamount to admitting that it was her son's fault! However, Nelson did nothing wrong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was about to speak but Kyla spoke before she could. "I won't apologize, nor will I let my son apologize. I believe everything my son said. My son did nothing wrong!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson Corbyn's mom, have you thought this through? If you don't apologize, I won't be able to put in a good word for you!" the class teacher said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla smiled sarcastically. "You're a teacher. You should find out the truth instead of taking sides like this. People would think you're their spokesperson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." The class teacher's face instantly went red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The mother of the boy who fought with Nelson snorted coldly. "It doesn't matter if you apologize or not. Our children don't want to be in the same classroom with a child from such a family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was so mad that she nearly forgot about her pregnancy and started rolling up her sleeves to start scolding. However, a voice suddenly rang out at the door, "Since you don't want to be in the same classroom, then you can leave the school."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The people in the discipline office all looked over and saw a tall figure entering the room. He was wearing a suit and tie. He had a handsome face that was somewhat feminine. It was Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was instantly delighted when she saw Hadwin Stephenson come over. "Hadwin!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your eyes are red." Hadwin Stephenson went up to Lina and raised his hand to caress her red eyes. "What's going on? Are they kicking Nelson out of school?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, they're going too far," said Lina as she briefed Hadwin Stephenson about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson glanced coldly at the class teacher and the married couple. "They've indeed gone too far."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although he had no feelings for Nelson, he knew that Lina adored the deaf child. He would not tolerate others insulting the child Lina adored.</p></div>
