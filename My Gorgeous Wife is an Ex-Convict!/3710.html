        <h1>Chapter 3708</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pair of eyes that were originally closed suddenly opened, and the gaze swept over her face calmly but coldly. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tight grip and warmth on her wrist made Veronica finally realize that the scene before her was not a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...what are you doing here?" she asked nervously, trying to pull her hand back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let go of her hand and sat up. "Don't you remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." She opened her mouth, and suddenly the fragmented memories from before flashed through her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right, she seemed to have broken free from Crispin, then hugged Mason, and then...asked him to save her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her expression became awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember now?" He got off the bed and straightened out his wrinkled clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You sent me back?" she asked. She only remembered that she seemed to have fallen into his arms at the end, and then she couldn't remember anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, how do you think you got back?" he asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt uneasy. "Then why were you...uh, why were you sleeping here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for you holding me down, I could have left a long time ago," he said, his voice carrying a barely noticeable hint of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only he knew that he could have left earlier, but for some reason... he just didn't. He let her press against him like that, and then... he fell asleep without realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it the same atmosphere as back then? It was so similar to the memories in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered that he used to love falling asleep with her like this, lying on the same bed, intimately close to each other. It was as if in this world, they only had each other, and as long as they had each other, they could survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the memory in his mind was devoid of any emotion, as if he was just watching an old movie, the experience from last night helped him slowly fill in the missing emotions that had been hypnotized away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm... I'm sorry," Veronica apologized in a choked voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And in the future, don't just hug someone and scream for help. Since you dressed like that and were with that kind of man yesterday, you should have known what would happen," Mason said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face turned white at the thought of last night's events, and she defended herself, "I didn't... it's not what you think!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know what I'm thinking? Isn't the Barlow family trying to get Toyar Group's business? Isn't this Toyar Group's young master your benefactor?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned from white to red, and she tightly gripped the sheet on her body. She was both embarrassed and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really see me that way?" she asked, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How I see you doesn't matter at all. I just hope that next time, you won't come and bother me," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bother you?" she murmured, feeling a certain emotion bursting in her chest. She lifted the thin blanket on her body, got out of bed, looked up at him and said, "Mason, do you think I shouldn't have asked you for help yesterday? I should have let that bastard take me to the elevator, take me back to the room, and do those dirty things to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's your business, it has nothing to do with me," he replied, his voice indifferent, cold, and unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's my business, it really has nothing to do with you..." she said bitterly, "Then why did you save me? Why did you bring me back?"</span></p></div>
