        <h1>Chapter 1340</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though her broken armor was full of cracks, she still did not want to be belittled and ridiculed by this man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, what&rsquo;s happening to you?" Martin Weiss's voice rang above her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." She tried to say she was okay, but she almost bit her tongue when she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body was trembling slightly while large drops of sweat gushed from her forehead, running down her cheeks. Her pale face had been drained of all color, and even her lips were pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take you to the hospital!" said Martin Weiss. He had seen her in such pain more than once!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held her arm as he spoke, only not as hard as he held it before. He even held her gingerly as though he was afraid of hurting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I don't need to go to the hospital," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why won't you go to the hospital? Why are you trying to be brave?" Martin Weiss asked angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said with difficulty after a long time, "Since when... have you become so sympathetic? Isn't my painful death exactly... what you want? What the father owes, the daughter pays. Didn't you keep demanding... me to pay my father's debt?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was so gloomy that it seemed like it would rain above his head. "Kyla Corbyn, are you that desperate to die?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don't want to die. I want to live... but... staying alive is too hard!' Kyla Corbyn's eyes flickered with sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That look of sadness instantly stung Martin Weiss's heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He shook his head violently to shake the pain out of his heart. He pulled her to the door and opened it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as soon as he opened the door, he happened to see Chase Harper standing there. Chase Harper had his hand raised with the intention to ring the doorbell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes narrowed as he stared at Chase Harper. He remembered this man. This man and Kyla Corbyn had looked intimately at each other downstairs the other day, and Kyla Corbyn had smiled at the man for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Chase Harper stared blankly at the two people in front of him, his mind a little lost all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss sneered, "I was wondering why you wouldn&rsquo;t let me send you to the hospital. Were you waiting for your lover at home? You said you wanted to stay with your son for another three months, but you can't wait for your lover to come to you. You're really shameless, Kyla Corbyn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gasped for breath. "Martin Weiss, it has nothing to do with you whether I'm shameless or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss raised his eyebrows and said with a half-smile, "Does this man know that you've been to prison? Does he know how you said you loved me and climbed into my bed? Does he know&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss! Mr. Weiss, right?" Chase Harper immediately interrupted Martin Weiss. 'I... I don't know what your relationship with Kyla is, but I think a man shouldn't say that about a woman no matter what!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared coldly at Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper tried to meet his eyes and said, "Kyla is a good woman. You shouldn't say such things about her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla...' Martin Weiss only found the way he addressed her particularly irritating to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at Chase Harper gratefully and said to Martin Weiss, "Mr. Weiss, my friend is here. Even if I have to go to the hospital, my friend will take me there. There's no need to trouble you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper quickly said, "Ah, then... Then I'll send you to the hospital!" With that, he took Kyla Corbyn's other arm and looked at Martin Weiss. "Mr. Weiss, please let go so I can send Kyla to the hospital."</p></div>
