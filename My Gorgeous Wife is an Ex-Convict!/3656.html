        <h1>Chapter 3654</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tears fell even harder, her hands grabbing his sleeves as if desperately trying to hold onto him and not let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tears dripped onto his hand, scorching hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An important person...there was a hint of confusion in his eyes. She had said the same thing to him before, but what happened later? Didn't they just cut ties, without even giving him a chance to explain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! I don't need your guilt, and you don't need to cry like this in front of me!" Roger suddenly raised his arm and pulled his sleeve away from her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stumbled back, her hand empty, and fell backwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door to the music room was pushed open again, and William rushed forward in one step, catching Jasper's body and preventing her from falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay?" William asked worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper shook her head. "Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I figured you must have come to the school, so I drove here too. It took me a while to find this place," William said as he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped Jasper's tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger stood by, watching the scene with cold eyes, feeling a sharp pain in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick, who followed them into the piano room, looked at Roger and said, "Lawrence, long time no see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was any doubt before, seeing his sister in tears, Mick knew that the person in front of him must be Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reed, it has been a long time," Roger sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper has been searching for you for years, and it hasn't been easy. Many people gave up, even thought it wasn't worth it to keep looking. But she didn't give up. She begged her father to keep sending people to find you because she believed you were still alive! She thought that if she gave up, you might really be gone," Mick said. As the eldest son of the Reed family, he knew this matter better than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you've been found, you don't have to spend that energy searching anymore," Roger said indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick looked at him and pursed his lips. "Lawrence, it was a tragedy that your parents died, but it has nothing to do with Jasper. She doesn't owe you anything! Don't take it out on her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is between her and me. Mr. Reed, you're meddling too much," Roger lazily looked at Mick, then glanced at the clock on the wall. "Well, my time for renting the piano room is up. I should go. If you want to talk, we can do it next time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed the piano lid, picked up his shoulder bag, and walked straight to the door of the piano room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lawrence!" Jasper suddenly shouted, "Have you been doing well these years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, but didn't turn around. His voice was cold and indifferent. "I'm not Lawrence anymore. I'm just Roger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he walked out of the piano room. The three people in the room had different expressions and thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick wasn't a student at Stanford University, and he had classes in the morning, so he left first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by Jasper, William came to a secluded place on campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Jasper's red eyes, William felt heartbroken. But at the same time, a strong sense of unease spread through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he compete with Jasper's feelings for Lawrence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what kind of impact would Lawrence's appearance have on him and Jasper? He didn't know, but a sense of instinctive crisis was telling him that there might be more waves in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Lawrence's appearance this time should not be pure, what is Lawrence's motive?!</span></p></div>
