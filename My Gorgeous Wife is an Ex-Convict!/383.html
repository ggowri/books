        <h1>Chapter 382</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"According to our investigation, Miss Cummins's father has paid three months&rsquo; worth of rent here after taking out her mother's cinerary casket. After a brief visit on the first day, he hasn't been here since. At the same time, Miss Cummins's father has not contacted any cemeteries or made any arrangements to buy a cemetery plot," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her head and looked at the cinerary casket in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her father... never really intended to move her mother's grave from the beginning. He did all these to blackmail her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would probably just throw the cinerary casket back to her when he got enough benefits from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could even save the money on a cemetery plot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wondered how her mother would feel if she knew how the man she had once loved was treating her after her death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found it funny and sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her nose was a little sore, but this time, her tears did not fall. Maybe she had cried too much earlier, so she did not have any more tears to shed this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," Grace said as she looked up at Jason. Without him, she would never have found her mother's ashes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really want to thank me, you may as well thank me later," Jason said and looked at Terrence. "Has everything been arranged?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all set," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason once again turned to Grace and said, "Take your mother's ashes. The first thing we should do now is to bury your mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned as she looked at him blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on. I've made all the arrangements," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only a simple sentence, but it inexplicably calmed her down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed as if with him around, she had nothing to worry about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Jason out of the group rental house and got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car once again stopped, they were already at a famous cemetery in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because of its location, convenient transportation, and well-planned cemetery, it was difficult to buy a cemetery plot here even if you had money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace to one of the empty cemetery plots where there were already several people in uniforms waiting as well as a few people who looked like the staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked in amazement at the tombstone with her mother's name on it and her name on the bottom right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had prepared all these.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had helped her to settle everything she could not do right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is where your mother will be buried. If you don't like it here, you can choose somewhere else," said Jason.</p></div>
