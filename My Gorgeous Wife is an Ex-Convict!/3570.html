        <h1>Chapter 3568</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's expression froze, as if she had asked the wrong question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I've never been interested in this kind of game," he replied coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After they returned to school, Roger walked silently towards the boys' dormitory, while Jasper walked gloomily towards the girls' dormitory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today was a complete failure. Not only did they fail to get the straw, but when they returned, Roger was clearly angry. It seemed that he got angry after she asked that question about the toy window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she didn't understand what exactly made him angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she returned to her dorm room, she saw a pile of snacks she liked on her desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meave, her roommate, said to her, "These were sent by William. He came to the dorm to see you, but you weren't here, so he asked me to bring them up for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper suddenly felt a little warmth in her heart, which reduced the sense of frustration she had experienced with Roger earlier that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Speaking of which, what about your childhood friend? Are you really not interested in him?" Meave said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since they had been roommates for a while, Jasper's dorm mates had discovered that although she was the princess of the Reed family, she was not as unapproachable as they had imagined. On the contrary, she was very approachable, so they started to make small jokes and chat with her like normal people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Jasper couldn't help but roll his eyes. "You make it sound like you're asking me to do something immoral."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, don't say that. I think William's feelings for you go beyond just childhood friends. At the mixer the other day, when Roger asked if you wanted to date him, William's face changed and he even pulled you aside. I think he likes you," said the roommate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I think so too!" chimed in Horea, another roommate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper furrowed his brow. "But if he really feels that way, he could just tell me directly." However, William has never expressed his feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's possible that guys are afraid of rejection," speculated Horea. "After all, if a confession fails, it could ruin the friendship too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other two people in the dormitory nodded, clearly agreeing with Horea's statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's eyes flashed with a hint of doubt, and Meave asked again, "What about you, Roger and William? Who do you find more interesting? They are both quite popular at school!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Them... Jasper hesitated. She had completely different feelings towards them. She approached Roger because she suspected he was Lawrence, and she approached William because of the friendship they had built over the years, which gave her a feeling that went beyond just being friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was like they were kindred spirits, yet also like family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many times, William could understand her joys and sorrows, and knew what she needed without her even having to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It can be said that William understands her even better than her own brother Mick!</p></div>
