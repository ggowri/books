        <h1>Chapter 734</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stood in front of the hospital's entrance, still hesitating and unsure whether she was making the right choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I really going to find out the truth? If it's a lost memory, could it be restored? What happens after I restore it? Will I be entangled with Brian, or will it make Jason feel more insecure?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Should I restore the memory, or should I bury it forever? Should I just act as if I know everything and treat my headache in some other way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or, as long as I can keep Brian at arm's length in the future and not let him stimulate my memory, then the headaches will probably stop, right?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins!" Suddenly, a female voice rang in Grace's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she knew it, she found herself in front of Dr. Leng's office, and the one who called her had been the nurse who was with Dr. Leng yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins, something came up with Dr. Leng this morning, and she had to ask for leave for some time. I'm sorry to make you come here in vain. Dr. Leng took an emergency leave, and it was so sudden that we haven't had time to contact you," the nurse said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt relieved at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Dr. Leng isn&rsquo;t here today. At least, I don't have to be hypnotized today and I don't have to worry about restoring my memory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Worry?' She was immediately stunned. 'Am I worried about... Restoring my memory?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I worried because... I'm afraid that restoring my memory will make things more complicated and confusing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Perhaps I know that&hellip; Not restoring this memory is the best choice?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace kept her head down while thinking as she walked toward the elevator at the end of the corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just before her hand reached the elevator button, another hand suddenly grabbed her wrist. In the next moment, she was pulled into the exit passageway next to the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a door between it and the hospital corridor, but it was unlike the corridors where people walked by now and then. It was... So quiet here as if they were two worlds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian!" Grace looked at the man in front of her in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The stairway of the exit passageway was dimly lit. They were standing in a position in which he had his back to the light and the greater part of his face was in the dark, so she could not see his expression right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, why are you here to see a psychiatrist? Even to the point of hypnosis. What are you doing with hypnosis?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a rare urgency in the tone of his voice, which was normally cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned, and her eyes widened. She did not expect Brian to know what she was doing here today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Therefore, this is&hellip;' "You had someone stalk and investigate me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together and did not deny it. "Tell me, what on earth are you trying to hypnotize? Is there..." His lips suddenly quivered, and he spat out the second half of the sentence, "Do you need hypnosis... To help you remember something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly stiffened. From what Brian said just now, he probably only knew that she came to the hospital for hypnosis today, but he did not know the details of what she was going to do with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore he could only make a guess, but it was a good one.</p></div>
