        <h1>Chapter 655</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay looked at Brian who was in a daze, and a flash of jealousy flashed in her eyes. 'Brian and Grace know each other, and Brian seems to be suppressing something right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be that Brian and Grace... No, it can't be!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay quickly comforted herself. &lsquo;He's the crown prince of the entertainment industry. How could he be interested in a woman who has been to prison?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace got a stroke of luck for Jason to fall for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides, Brian now thinks I&rsquo;m the one who saved him as a child! Therefore, I'm the most important person in Brian's heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I just have to take advantage of this opportunity and never let Brian find out the truth!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace is so lucky to date Jason. Grace even came to the hospital in a wedding dress today. Are they getting married..." Stella Lindsay's voice paused as she spoke because Brian was not listening to her at all. His eyes were just staring at the empty space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What&rsquo;s he looking at?' Stella Lindsay only felt the sense of unease in her heart growing&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason walked out of the house and found a random restaurant. Although Grace had not had lunch because she hurried over here, she did not feel hungry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry to keep you with me. We haven't had lunch until now," said Grace. She looked at the food in front of her but did not even touch her chopsticks to start eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is there to be sorry for? Of course, I'm going to stay with you after all that," he said and glanced at her as she left her plate untouched. "Even if you're not hungry, eat a little. If you're going to keep vigil over your grandmother these three days, then you need to maintain your energy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew Jason was right. She did need to eat something to keep her strength up so that she could keep watch over her grandmother's funeral.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her head down, she ate the food mouthful by mouthful, but in her mouth, it was like she was chewing wax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it bad? How about I take you to somewhere else?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it doesn't matter where we eat," said Grace. As if completing a task, she hurried through the food in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said nothing more and ate with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they finished eating, he paid the bill, and as he walked out with her, he asked, "You don&rsquo;t like your cousin to be with Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you ask that?" asked Grace after pausing for a moment at the abrupt question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you seemed unhappy when your cousin held Brian's arm." As he spoke, he watched her reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took a moment for Grace to realize what Jason was talking about. "There's nothing to be unhappy about. I didn&rsquo;t know my cousin had divorced then, so I thought her holding Brian that intimately was a little inappropriate. However, since my cousin is divorced, it's all right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you think it's a bit of a coincidence that the person Brian has been looking for is your cousin?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I do," answered Grace. Then, as if reminded of something, she said, "Brian seems to have mentioned that I look like someone he knows. Considering that my cousin and I looked alike when we were children, he must have thought I look similar to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe." Jason's eyelashes quivered a little. "At least now he won't insist that you're the one he&rsquo;s looking for."</p></div>
