        <h1>Chapter 4051</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking back to that time, Jasper found it amusing that Chandler often had a black face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, Tina was like a chanting machine. Whenever she saw Chandler, she would talk about how he had the potential to become an idol star. She even rallied the people around her to persuade Chandler to participate in a talent show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made Chandler extremely frustrated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, during that time, Chandler managed to control his temper towards Tina, which Jasper found to be quite rare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a child of the Reed family, Jasper was always protected by her family, but she was not naive and ignorant of everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially after experiencing what happened with Lawrence, she understood the dark side of human nature even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As her mother said, when judging people, one should not only look at the surface, as many people hide another side of themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, the closer a person is to you, the more likely they are to hide another side of themselves from you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does Daddy also hide another side of himself from you?" Jasper remembered asking this question at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, he does. Although I know, I don't mind because I know he does it out of love for me. He doesn't want me to see the side of him that might scare me or make me uncomfortable. Besides, it doesn't affect my love for him." Her mother replied in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Jasper had never really seen Chandler's other side, as an heir of the Crypt family, which had trained him, Chandler was definitely not just as elegant, stable, reasonable, and restrained as he appeared in front of Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did he participate in the talent show later?" Nancy asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No." Jasper said regretfully, "It's a pity. I really wanted to see Chandler participate in the talent show at that time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? You really wanted to see it?" William's voice suddenly sounded, with a hint of jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper shuddered and quickly smiled awkwardly, "Um...I just said I wanted to see him perform back then. And, don't you think it would be interesting if Chandler could sing and dance on stage like a boy band?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like you really want to see him debut. How about I talk to him when I meet him next time?" William suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, please don't!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper lamented in her heart. If Chandler found out, who knows if he would secretly make things difficult for her in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was just thinking out loud. Now, I don't want to see it anymore. Even if I did, I would be more interested in seeing how you would do if you debuted! Look at you, so handsome. If you really debuted, you would probably have a bunch of young girls fawning over you. It's a good thing you didn't debut, or else I would have to compete with a bunch of girls for you!" Jasper flattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words clearly pleased William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, that's great. I'll dance for you someday, so you don't have to think about it anymore," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper widened her eyes in surprise, "You'll really dance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there a reason for me to lie? It's not that difficult," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's eyes suddenly lit up, and a hint of anticipation appeared in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at the scene in front of her and felt that William really doted on Jasper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it's not difficult to sing and dance like a boy band, William should still need to practice if he wants to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, for some men, they may not be willing to sacrifice their dignity to do these things just to please a woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But William was willing to do it.</p></div>
