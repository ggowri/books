        <h1>Chapter 2991</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Brian finally let go of his embrace. Valda smiled at the man in front of her and said, "Okay, from now on, you also have to believe in me like I believe in you. Trust that I won't misunderstand you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her phoenix-like eyes seemed to be covered in a layer of mist. After a long pause, he finally murmured, "Okay." He felt so lucky to have met someone like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda said, "Okay, let's try the cake I bought."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she turned around to get the cake, she realized that Whitney was nowhere to be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took out a cake from the cake box and handed it to him, saying "Here, try it out. I had a piece on my way here and it tasted pretty good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took the cake and started eating it in small bites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you ask me what Whitney came to do earlier?" Brian asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked her eyes and said, "Do you want me to ask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly didn't know how to respond, and from her gaze, it was clear that she had no curiosity at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So Brian didn't ask any further and said directly, "I'll send Whitney back overseas and ask her not to stay in Emerald City anymore. I know she has some other thoughts about me, but I don't have any feelings for her. It's just because she..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused, his throat feeling a bit dry, "It's just because she looks a bit like Grace. When I saw her overseas, I didn't want her to get into trouble, so I arranged for her to stay at the overseas branch and gave her a secretary position. I just didn't expect her to suddenly come to Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He explained to her that he usually wouldn't explain these things to others, even if others had any random guesses, he wouldn't bother to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But facing her, he took the initiative to explain, afraid that she would misunderstand something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He didn't want any misunderstandings between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, does she want to go back overseas?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If she's willing, then I'll have someone arrange a job for her at the overseas company where she can support herself. Of course, that job won't be a secretary anymore, just some basic work. If she continues to stay overseas, then the company won't arrange any work for her here," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if she stays in Emerald City but does something that will get her into trouble again, what will you do?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't bother with her anymore," Brian said. Arranging a job for Whitney overseas was already his greatest kindness to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't need to take responsibility for her life. I felt sorry for her because of her appearance, but that doesn't mean I will continue to feel sorry for her," Brian replied. "I won't see her again in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda smiled again. Although she trusted Brian, his willingness to explain these things to her made her feel respected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is the cake delicious?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's delicious," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll try it too. I've never tasted this flavor before," she said, taking a small spoon and intending to take a bite of his cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he lifted his hand and directly grabbed the back of her head, took a small bite of the cake, and leaned towards her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She widened her eyes in surprise, could it be that he... he doesn't want to...</p></div>
