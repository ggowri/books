        <h1>Chapter 332</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, you haven't been back to the office in a long time. Your old colleagues miss you very much. However, it's all right now. We can meet any time we want," said Andrea as she pulled Grace into the office. "Since you're here, why don't you meet your old colleagues?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glanced at Andrea. She certainly knew what she was up to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, she should just face them. If she escaped, they would only laugh at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I&rsquo;ll meet them," Grace said generously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her attitude, on the contrary, surprised Andrea. After all, it was not what she expected to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once inside, Andrea clapped her hands in the main office and drew everyone's attention. "Come and take a look, everybody. Grace, our former colleague, came back to see us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, many people in the office looked in their direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace looked around, she saw a mix of former colleagues and new ones she did not know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Andrea, did she work here before? Where is she working now?" asked a young new colleague.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The question was just as Andrea wanted, but Andrea still showed a look of regret and said, "Grace used to be the most promising rookie we had here, and people said that before long, she would be a great lawyer and would be snapped up by all the law firms."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Which law firm is she in now?" the newcomer asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." Andrea looked at Grace with an embarrassed look on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace simply felt that Andrea's performance was botched. It was fine if she made it obvious that she was trying to step on her toes, but the most disgusting thing was that she had to do it while acting as if it was intolerable and awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm a delivery girl at Yan Yan Restaurant. You're welcome to place your order. I'll bring you some menus next time," Grace said unabashedly. There was no embarrassment or awkwardness on her face as Andrea had imagined. Grace even managed a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile set off her face with an indescribable gentleness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea gritted her teeth in secret. She was thinking to herself, 'Go on, I'll see how much longer you can act.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, your boyfriend seemed pretty well-off when I went shopping last time. Why are you making a living delivering food at a small restaurant? Don't be fooled. A lot of people like to fake as someone they're not these days. He probably didn't have much money but still pretended to be rich. He might owe a bunch of online loans behind your back," Andrea reminded as if she was concerned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a faint smile. "All right, I'll ask him some other time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea only felt as if she was hitting a soft nail. It was as if nothing she said would matter to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the newcomers at the firm had no idea why Grace had gone from a lawyer to a delivery girl. As Grace turned toward the firm's exit, she heard someone behind her asking the question.</p></div>
