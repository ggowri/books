        <h1>Chapter 3904</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica kissed her daughter's little face, which was warm and soft.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm a bit tired and want to sleep for a while," Veronica said exhaustedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you sleep. I'll stay by your side with our daughter," Mason said gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica fell asleep, feeling peaceful and secure with him by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica woke up again, she saw Mason guarding her bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides Mason, her mother-in-law Grace was also there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom," Veronica called out. After getting married, she started calling Jason and Grace "mom and dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've worked hard." Grace's eyes were full of pity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although they had been outside the delivery room before and didn't go in, they later learned from medical staff about the danger during childbirth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, because the baby had already been delivered, it got stuck in the birth canal, and even if they wanted to switch to a C-section halfway through, it was impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It wasn't hard. Although it was painful, it was worth it," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take good care of yourself. If you need anything, just tell Mom, okay?" Grace said with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Veronica nodded, feeling warm in her heart. "By the way, where's the baby..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She opened her eyes and hadn't seen her newborn daughter yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's in the reception room next door. Dad and the others are looking at the little one," Mason said. "They came in to see you before, but you were still asleep. They were afraid of disturbing you in this room, so they went to the adjacent reception room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This VIP suite was divided into two rooms, one where Veronica was lying down now, and the other was used for visitors to see the baby without disturbing the mother's rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was relieved to hear this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace continued to remind Veronica of what to pay attention to after childbirth, while Mason held Veronica's hand and never let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family was now on this side of the reception room, staring at the newborn baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The name had already been decided long ago. Since they were in the generation of respect, they named her Pearl Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pearl was Veronica's choice, hoping that even if the child was born into a wealthy family, she would still have a compassionate heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This new life attracted the attention of everyone in the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasmine used to be the youngest, but now there's someone even younger than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasmine, who just started junior high, has now become a little aunt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But why is she so ugly? She looks like a little monkey," Jasmine said bluntly, feeling that the baby in front of her looked nothing like the cute babies she had seen on TV shows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, the skin was still very red and not fair and tender at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She'll become more and more beautiful in a few days," Jasper said. She knew that newborn babies all looked like this because they had been soaking in amniotic fluid for too long, but they would look better later on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Jasmine said skeptically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, you looked like this when you were born too," Jasper said, then picked up the little one from their father's arms. "Wow, she's so cute. She looks a bit like Veronica!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Her eyes look like Mason's," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper then carefully looked at the baby's eyes and found that there was indeed a resemblance to their brother Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she and her older brother and Mason were triplets, they looked different because they were fraternal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If her older brother and dad looked alike, she looked more like her mom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her opinion, Mason looked more like their grandparents.</p></div>
