        <h1>Chapter 3913</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because this woman always got slapped in front of him but never asked for help, that made him so impressed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or was it because the swelling on her face was so glaring that he wanted to give her medicine?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want me to help you?" he suddenly spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned, "What?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can help you, so your sister won't dare to treat you like this again," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you want to help me?" Nancy was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No reason, you can just think of me as having a moment of kindness," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, for him, it was indeed a moment of kindness. In the past, he had never shown such kindness to a stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was silent for a moment and said, "Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Reed, but it's not necessary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her refusal made Mick's face slightly sink, "Nancy, my kindness is not something that happens often."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know, Mr. Reed, but I really don't need it," Nancy said calmly, "Relying on others for help is only temporary, not permanent. I would rather rely on myself to solve the problems between me and my sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick stared at the person in front of him, "Is that so? Alright, I understand. Nancy, my kindness to you is only this once, and there won't be any more in the future. Take care of yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he left the lounge on his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at the ointment left on the coffee table and the places on her face where it had been applied, as if... there was still a lingering sensation where his fingers had touched her cheek just now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, her face suddenly became hot, even hotter than when she was hit earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kindness... people like Mick, even if they do have a moment of kindness, it's only temporary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And once someone becomes too dependent on others for help, they will gradually become unable to break free from this dependence, just like her mother...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of her mother, Nancy's heart sank again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she had moved out of the Schultz family, her mother was still there, which meant that she couldn't completely cut ties with the Schultz family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, Clarissa lost face in front of Mick, and when she returns to the Schultz family, she might take her anger out on her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her stepfather had a good relationship with her mother, this relationship was nowhere near as strong as his love for Clarissa, his own daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, even when Clarissa yelled at her mother, acted unreasonably, and even resorted to physical violence, Francis would turn a blind eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy couldn't help but worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, she took some time to visit the Schultz family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she entered the house, she saw her mother's face swollen and even had gauze taped to the corner of her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, what happened?" Nancy hurriedly ran up and asked, "What happened to your face?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, I accidentally bumped into something," Eileen avoided her daughter's gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt a bitter taste in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of injury was not caused by herself, but... by being beaten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did Clarissa hit you?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No... you're thinking too much!" Eileen quickly denied, "She... she never hit me. Just avoid her when you see her at the hotel, so she won't get angry. She's interested in the young master of the Reed family, so don't get too close to him and let her misunderstand."</p></div>
