        <h1>Chapter 1158</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn said angrily, "You were wronged! It was that b*tch Paisley Daniels who did this to you! If you're really worried about the stigma, then we'll reverse the case. Didn't Grace say there&rsquo;s a 30% chance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn did not say anything more. She just stared at her son quietly. After a long while, she stood up and said, "Mom, I'm a little tired today. I'd like to go home and get some rest. I'm sorry you have to stay in the hospital to take care of Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn thought it was a little strange. With her daughter's character, she would spend the night in the hospital no matter what. However, considering how tough it was for her daughter to set up her food stall every night, she figured Kyla Corbyn must be so exhausted that her body could not take it anymore. As such, she said, "Then go home and get some rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll come back tomorrow morning to take your place," Kyla Corbyn said and left the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after getting out of the hospital, Kyla Corbyn did not go home. Instead, she walked to the bus stop and dialed a phone number. "I'm Kyla Corbyn. I need to talk to Martin Weiss about Nelson Corbyn tonight. If it's inconvenient for you to give me his contact information, then please help me contact him. I'll wait for your reply!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The phone number was the contact information of Martin Weiss's lawyer for the custody case. The name card came with the indictment as well as a description of the law firm and the lawyer's contact information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, Miss Corbyn. Please wait a moment. We'll call you back shortly," they said and ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stood at the bus stop, watching the buses pass by one after another. The October weather had cooled a little, and the night breeze was chilling as it blew past her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few minutes later, her phone rang. She pressed the answer button and heard the lawyer's voice. "Miss Corbyn, Mr. Weiss would like to see you,&rdquo; the lawyer said and gave her the address of the hotel Martin Weiss was staying in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half an hour later, Kyla Corbyn arrived at the hotel. It was a famous luxury hotel in Emerald City. Martin Weiss had brought her to the presidential suite here last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was still staying in the same hotel and room when he came to Emerald City this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stared blankly at the lights at the hotel&rsquo;s entrance and took a deep breath. She put away the bitter expression on her face and entered the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the way, no one stopped her or asked her anything. Kyla Corbyn guessed that Martin Weiss had probably told the hotel staff about her arrival, so she had a smooth journey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was still the same presidential suite. Kyla Corbyn walked to the door and knocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the door opened, and Kyla Corbyn caught sight of Martin Weiss's figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was wearing a navy blue sleeping robe, and his face was cold. Just a glance from those deep eyes gave her the urge to run away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she should say that over the years, avoiding him had become a habit of hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After being released from prison, all she had been thinking about was how to avoid him. However, she never thought that one day, she would take the initiative to appear in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's something... I want to talk to you about!" she said, but her voice sounded dry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her for a moment and then said, "You're not going to talk to me while you stand at the doorway, are you?" With that, he turned and walked into the room.</p></div>
