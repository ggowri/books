        <h1>Chapter 2126</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No way!" Kyla exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was a little wobbly. She took a deep breath several times and took out her phone. However, her hands trembled violently as she tried calling Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The call soon got through. As soon as Grace heard Jason's voice, she could not help sobbing. "Jay, think... think of a way. Lina is having a difficult labor. Many doctors have entered the delivery room. Find every good obstetrician in Emerald City. Nothing must happen to Lina. No..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She choked as she got to the end of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason immediately said, "Okay, stop crying. I'll think of something. Where are you right now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace gave him the hospital name, and Jason said, "Wait for me!" With that said, he hurriedly ended the phone call and rushed out of the office, leaving behind a group of people who was in a meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The crowd looked at each other, wondering what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence hurried out, caught up with Jason, and said, "Young master Reed, the meeting&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Postpone the meeting. Also, I need you to contact all the maternity specialists in tMason Swansonty right now. I want the best. Then get them to go to..." Jason told him the hospital where Lina was delivering the baby and entered the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence accepted the task in confusion. 'Maternity specialists?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is someone having a baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Young Madam isn't pregnant! But seeing Young master Reed looking so worried just now, it must be a big deal!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason drove to the hospital. As soon as Grace saw Jason, she immediately cried harder. "Have you found any doctors? Lina... Lina's condition seems to be getting worse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, the doctors should be here soon. Don't worry. Don't worry!" Jason quickly took Grace into his arms and comforted her softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He naturally knew how important Lina was to her, so he would not let anything happen to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I didn't expect Lina to have a difficult labor. Everything was fine when she went for her pregnancy check-ups! How did this happen? How..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson must have already done a lot of preparations, and the doctors he chose should also be experienced," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence soon hurried over and told them that tMason Swansonty's top obstetricians had gathered in the hospital. They were meeting in a temporary office to find a solution for Lina's a difficult labor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Meeting? How long will it take? How long can Lina hold on?" Grace panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It shouldn't take long. Besides, doctors need to know the patient&rsquo;s case thoroughly before they can make a judgment," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knew that too, but she could not stop feeling anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, it was not long before more doctors entered the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could only keep praying that her best friend was safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There were still moments when one would feel helpless no matter how much money or power one had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Martin Weiss rushed over. "What's the matter? Is Lina still in the delivery room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. "What are you doing here?"</p></div>
