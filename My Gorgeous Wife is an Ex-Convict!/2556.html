        <h1>Chapter 2554</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only came to take her away!" George Gregory walked up to Amber Mitchell step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">the Moss family's security guards tried to stop him but stopped when they saw Daley Moss waving his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching her husband's actions, Whitney Herrera whispered, "Do you plan to let George Gregory take Amber Mitchell away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Her feelings for Brother might not be that deep if she leaves with George Gregory. The wedding today will be canceled, of course," muttered Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if... she doesn&rsquo;t?" "Whitney Herrera asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If she doesn&rsquo;t leave, she'll be... my eldest brother's wife and my sister-in-law. the Moss family will naturally take care of her forever!" Daley Moss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Whitney Herrera understood that her husband was doing this to see how Amber Mitchell truly felt about Herman Moss. George Gregory's appearance was undoubtedly the best test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory walked up to Amber Mitchell. Looking at her in a wedding dress and delicate makeup, he fell into a trance. It was as if he were in a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had had such dreams many times. He dreamed that she had put on a wedding dress and become his bride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was now standing in the cemetery in a wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing? Why are you standing here in a wedding dress?" he asked as he glanced again at the ring she was holding. "What's this ring for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This has nothing to do with you, Mr. Gregory. This is the Moss family's cemetery. Please leave," Amber Mitchell said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can leave, but I'll take you with me!" George Gregory said and grabbed Amber Mitchell's right wrist. "Amby, come with me. I have a lot to say to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell froze. Amby... was a nickname no one had called her in years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wished she could hear someone call her that when she was in the mental hospital, but no!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every day brought her nothing but more disappointment and despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she no longer felt anything when she heard him call her Amby like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not leaving with you. It's my wedding with Herman today. You'd better let go right now, or I'll ask the security guards here to drag you away!" Amber Mitchell said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's pupils constricted, and he stiffened. "Excuse me? A wedding?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why else do you think I'm wearing a wedding dress, Mr. Gregory? And what do you think the ring is for?" "Amber Mitchell sarcastically asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory stared blankly at the person in front of him. Then, he turned to look at the tombstone on one side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did he read the tombstone and saw the words&mdash;&lsquo;Wife, Amber Mitchell&rsquo;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You are marrying Herman Moss?" he asked, almost in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not, I&rsquo;ve already married him,&rdquo; Amber Mitchell corrected him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're marrying a dead man, Amber Mitchell. What are you thinking?" George Gregory asked with a note of fear in his voice that he did not notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Though Herman has died, he lives on in my heart. He saved me with his life. What's wrong with me marrying him?" Amber Mitchell replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you intend to repay him for saving your life in this way? If you just want to repay his kindness, I can repay it for you in other ways. You can..." George Gregory said quickly</p></div>
