        <h1>Chapter 2638</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the one who did not believe him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he did not believe her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that two people believing in each other was such a difficult thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was stunned to learn from Camille Strickland that Gloria had agreed to play the male lead in the adaptation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said excitedly, "Could it be fake? The producer told me! I heard Gloria had turned down the role at first, but for some reason, he agreed in the end. You're so lucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought she was lucky too. After all, Gloria was said to be picky about the projects he chose to star in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, now that Gloria is playing the male lead, the drama&rsquo;s success is almost guaranteed. By the way, what's going on with you and your boyfriend?" said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess we're familiarizing ourselves with each other," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is he looking for a fake girlfriend because his family's forcing him to marry or something?" After all, there was a lot of such news. Renting boyfriends and girlfriends was popular nowadays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Probably not, but he never told me the exact reason," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you going to ask him?" Camille Strickland panicked. She was worried that her best friend would get fooled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Everyone has their secrets. At least he's not a bad person. Besides, he made it pretty clear to me at the beginning of our relationship. We're just like ordinary friends every time we go on a date. He doesn&rsquo;t touch me," said Valda Theller. On the contrary, she was the one who almost touched him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But then again, do you feel nothing when going on a date with a man with a face like that?" Camille Strickland asked. The man was mature and elegant. His delicate facial features were as good as those of movie stars, especially those phoenix eyes. Even though Camille Strickland had only seen them once, she was impressed by them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had rarely seen such beautiful phoenix eyes on men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "No, I have the impulse to draw him, but I won't have feelings for him. He warned me that he won't fall for me from the beginning, so he asked me not to fall for him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? He did that?" Camille Strickland looked surprised. "Did he... say such a thing because he&rsquo;s romantically wounded?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Romantically wounded?' Valda Theller recalled Brian mentioning a friend who used to work at the small noodle shop before it became the small restaurant they dined in that day. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not have met Brian again at the small restaurant if he had not missed that friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could he be romantically wounded... by the &lsquo;friend&rsquo; he talked about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, what's come over you? Did you recall something?" Camille Strickland's voice rang in Valda Theller's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. I&rsquo;m just wondering what kind of woman could wound him romantically," she mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland speculated aloud, "She must be a beautiful woman, a city socialite, a celebrity, or something like that. Didn't you say he introduced himself as a company&rsquo;s project leader? Besides, I saw that the clothes he wore that day weren't cheap. He would probably be rich if he isn&rsquo;t a fraud."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I&rsquo;ll probably never get the chance to meet the woman who hurt Brian romantically,' thought Valda Theller.</p></div>
