        <h1>Chapter 1595</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes." Terrence left the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes, and muttered, "Grace's... alive... She&rsquo;s alive..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He burst into laughter. His laughter grew louder, but tears appeared at the corners of his closed eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Drop after drop of tears fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had recovered most of his memories. He remembered how they met, how they fell in love with each other, how they broke up... and how they got married...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">From those incidents, he knew how deeply he loved her. It was so deep that he began to understand what fear, regret, and powerlessness were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was painful every time he thought about the time she found out about the truth of Jennifer's case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had assumed that she would never know as long as he covered up the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it turned out that there were always accidents in this world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now that she had returned and was so in love with him, it was almost like a dream to him. He was afraid that he would wake up from it one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even in recent nights, he would open his eyes once she was sound asleep to look at her face and gently touch her with his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was like he wanted to prove over and over again that she was right beside him, and she would not repel his touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't hate me, and don't leave me, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hoarse voice gently melted into the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace and Jason went to the amusement park together with their two little ones on the weekend. It all started when she pinned Jay down and almost did something to him. Right at that moment, her daughter suddenly pushed the door open and shouted at her, "Mommy, Brother has never been to the amusement park with Daddy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Grace could come back to her senses, her son asked, "Are Daddy and Mommy going to have a baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace almost fell off Jason and down the bedside. Fortunately, his hand supported her and prevented her from falling off the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Have a baby?" Her voice rose. "What made you think that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's common sense that married couples who sleep together with one on top of the other will have babies," Mick Reed said solemnly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could only turn her head to look at Jason and say, "He's only five years old. Why would he... know such a thing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's portrayed in TV shows sometimes. He happened to see it once and asked Uncle Kwan. Uncle Kwan told him it was to have a baby,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"..." Grace had also seen TV shows before and knew that the scenes in TV shows were very subtle&mdash;just two actors holding each other before the camera zoomed out. Nothing else was shown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It also seemed normal for children to be curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It would be difficult to explain to the children what they were doing. Grace could almost imagine how hard it had been for Uncle Kwan to explain.</p></div>
