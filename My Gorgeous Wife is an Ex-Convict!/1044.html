        <h1>Chapter 1043</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was already busy with work at the food stall. When she saw Grace, she greeted her warmly, "Why are you here today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I'm free this evening, so I thought I'd come and see you. Is anyone still bothering you these days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's expression changed slightly. Seeing this, Grace immediately asked, "Someone's still bothering you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. I reported it to the police afterward, and the police will be patrolling these two nights. However&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Kyla Corbyn could finish talking, a few people who looked like thugs suddenly came to the stall. As soon as they came over, they drove her customers away and ordered a few of the cheapest dishes. Just like that, they filled all the tables.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn only had four folding tables, so there were no more empty tables as soon as they appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When a customer wanted to share the table, they would scare them away angrily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned. "Is this... how they bother you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled wryly before saying, "Yeah. I can only serve some customers who come for takeaway. The police can't do anything about them. I'll just set up my stall somewhere else if there's no other way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It seems that sending the three thugs to the police station was only a temporary relief!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Paisley Daniels must have sent these people too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'We probably have to go to Paisley Daniels if we want to solve this problem once and for all! However, Paisley Daniels isn't in Emerald City... We may not meet Paisley Daniels even if we go to tMason Swansonty she's in.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day at the office, Grace was still thinking about Kyla Corbyn's issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At noon, several colleagues were chatting about the entertainment industry's charity gala this evening, saying that many celebrities would be attending it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had heard about it. It was a huge party in the entertainment industry, but it had nothing to do with her. Therefore, she did not pay much attention to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, she heard someone mention, "I heard that the president of Weiss Group and his fianc&eacute;e will attend the charity gala together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's probably an occasion for them to show off their affection for each other. I think I read somewhere online that the man suddenly left the party where they were supposed to announce their wedding date. It embarrassed the lady greatly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"These rich and powerful couples all look affectionate with each other, but who knows what goes on behind the scenes? Once, someone said they're on bad terms with each other and they immediately appeared in public to show off their affection."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah! However, the president of Weiss Group, what's his name... Oh, yes. Martin Weiss's pretty good-looking. He looks just like an idol!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He wouldn&rsquo;t be trending otherwise!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes lit up when she heard a few gossipy female colleagues chatting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels are attending the charity gala?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Charity galas organized by the entertainment industry&hellip;' Grace thought of Brian. Maybe she could attend the charity gala and meet Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels if she asked Brian for a favor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I try not to bother Brian, but... I have to help with Kyla's issue. Otherwise, Paisley Daniels will keep giving Kyla trouble.'</p></div>
