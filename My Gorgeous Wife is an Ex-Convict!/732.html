        <h1>Chapter 731</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few days ago, Nelson saw the birthday present she prepared for Grace and asked out of curiosity. Therefore, she told her son that the 22nd of this month was his Aunty Grace&rsquo;s birthday. When the time came, she would give it to her as a surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect her son to take Grace's birthday to heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, Grace was so kind to Nelson. How could Nelson not take it to heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Children were always simple and direct. They would get close to whoever was kind to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to choose a present for Aunty myself," the little one said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could not help hesitating as she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace has given Nelson so much help. Without Grace's help, Nelson wouldn't have gotten such a good hearing aid so soon. It&rsquo;s only normal that he wants to choose a gift for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, the mall is crowded, and we&rsquo;d be spending a lot of time outside to choose a present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The longer we stay out, the more risk there is!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After all... Martin Weiss should still be in Emerald City these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If we bump into Martin Weiss&hellip;' Kyla's body could not help but tremble at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after so many years, even though her heart was already dead, every time she thought of the man, some kind of pain would spread in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person she loved most had brought her the deepest pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she was trying her best to hide from him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy!" Nelson looked up with longing in his eyes, and she could see how much he wanted to pick out a present for his favorite aunt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated for a moment before nodding anyway. "All right, but choose quickly. We have to go home early."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure!" replied Nelson as he nodded obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took her son by the hand and walked into the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The first floor of the mall was mostly occupied by luxury brands. Looking at those once very familiar brand names, Kyla felt like an eternity had passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss doted on her, he used to buy her many designer clothes and bags.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she liked it, he would not hesitate to buy it for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she thought this was the way a man loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it turned out doting and loving were not the same. Doting could be done by treating you like an object and showering you with materialistic things at will, but it did not contain any sincerity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was too late when she realized this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson took Kyla's hand and approached the women's wear counter on the third floor. The little one wanted to pick out a pair of glass slippers for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was because when he was in the park, he heard some little girls saying they wanted Cinderella's glass slippers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Glass slippers are not for sale, but we can pick out a nice pair of shoes for Aunty Grace, all right?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson's delicate eyebrows wrinkled, then he reluctantly agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when they were picking out the shoes, the little one became excited again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stayed by her son, looking gently at the little creature that gave her the courage to live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, out of the corner of her eye, Kyla caught a glimpse of a figure coming down an escalator not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body immediately became as stiff as a board.</p></div>
