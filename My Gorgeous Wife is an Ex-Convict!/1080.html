        <h1>Chapter 1079</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought of getting out of here by pretending to love him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... How long could she &lsquo;pretend&rsquo;? Unless she could keep this up forever, it would end up badly when Jason found out she lied to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">More importantly, she did not want to use her feelings to deceive his feelings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mansion was large. The buildings and pavilions inside were just like those seen in rich and powerful families' residences in movies and dramas. There were many lotus-related items there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For example, lotus porcelains. The pillars and beams also had carvings of lotus flowers. Some antique furniture also had lotus carvings, not to mention the lotus pond in the yard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lotus flowers here were still in full bloom even though it was already past their season, which was really strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The owner of the mansion probably liked lotus flowers very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or maybe... It was the woman imprisoned here back then who was fond of lotus flowers?' Grace thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was quite fond of lotus flowers herself. Perhaps it was because lotus flowers always seemed pure even though they grew in mud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked around the house, looking for Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though he kept her in the mansion, he did not restrict her movements in it. At least she was &lsquo;free&rsquo; within the confines of the mansion, so to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, she stopped when she reached a passage and looked into one of the rooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered seeing Jason coming out of this room once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Would he... be in the room?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stepped forward and knocked twice on the door. When she heard no answer, she pushed open the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to her surprise, it was a dark room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The room was small and heavy curtains covered the windows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The furnishings in the room were also simple... It was probably too simple, for the entire room consisted of a single display case with a glass cover. Inside laid a long ancient sword.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought it was an ancient sword because of the blade's sheen and the degree of oxidation on the handle. It looked years old, and the blade was patchy with a lot of dark brown stuff that did not look like rust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A full-length black curtain hid the wall in front of the shelf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The room was rather odd, so to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could see that Jason was not here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to leave when suddenly, she heard footsteps behind her. Then Jason's cold voice rang out. "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately turned around and that handsome face caught her eye. "I was looking for you. I entered this room to see if you were here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Looking for me?" he asked lightly. He walked to the center of the room and approached the display case with the ancient sword.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I want to contact Lina and Kyla. Lina will be worried if she can't find me, and Kyla... I'm representing her in her custody case. I can't get out of here right now... And her case is also a little difficult."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his thin lips as those dark eyes stared at her, examining the truth of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I'm just contacting them to tell them something. I'm not going to say anything more than that. Besides, even if I do say something, they wouldn't be able to take me away even if they did find this place."</p></div>
