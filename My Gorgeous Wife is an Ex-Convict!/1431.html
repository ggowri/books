        <h1>Chapter 1430</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, he did not even know what he should do and how to ask for her forgiveness!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn and Mrs. Corbyn went home. Kyla Corbyn asked the two bodyguards Jason sent to go back first, telling them they did not have to keep watch at her place. After all, her place was quite small and not suitable for them to stay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After the two bodyguards left, Mrs. Corbyn poked her head out and looked out of the window. She saw Martin Weiss's car parked in front of the apartment downstairs. Martin Weiss was standing beside the car, facing the apartment building while standing motionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Corbyn frowned. "How long is this man going to stand there for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mom, ignore him. He can stand however long he wants. It has nothing to do with us," Kyla Corbyn said quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Corbyn asked in confusion, "But why did his attitude change so suddenly? Did he find out that Paisley Daniels had set you up for the miscarriage back then? Is that why he came to apologize?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, news of Paisley Daniels's scandal that aired on the streets had become so viral that even elderly people like Mrs. Corbyn knew about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's just one of the reasons. He also learned that I was the one who donated him the bone marrow," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What?" Mrs. Corbyn was surprised, and she clenched her teeth harder. "It was him! So he's the person with no conscience! You saved his life by donating him your bone marrow. Has he never thought about how he got his life? He rejected it when it was his turn to donate you his liver!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that in mind, Mrs. Corbyn was ready to rush out of their home and give Martin Weiss a piece of her mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mom!" Kyla Corbyn stopped her mother. "Calm down. I donated the bone marrow of my own accord; no one forced me. It's completely up to him whether he wants to donate his liver. There's nothing to be mad about! Besides, I might not do any better even if I undergo liver transplant surgery. Maybe my body will reject it after the surgery and I'll have a shorter life. Maybe I'll be stuck in bed for my remaining months."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She hated Martin Weiss. It had nothing to do with the liver donation. She just hated Martin Weiss for pushing her into such a situation where he would even trample on her last shred of dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that time, she had only felt that she was no longer a person or a life in his eyes, but an object to make Paisley Daniels and the Daniels family happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "Mom, stay home and make dinner. I'll pick Nelson up today. The days I can pick him up are numbered now, so each time counts."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She just wanted to spend more time with her mother and son in her last days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But Martin Weiss is still downstairs. If you go downstairs, what if he..." Mrs. Corbyn said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "He probably won't do anything to me. What's more, we can't really avoid some things. Why not face them directly, then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Corbyn sighed and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn took her medicine, tidied up the place, and went downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as Kyla Corbyn came out of the apartment building, Martin Weiss saw her and suddenly trembled. He quickly stepped forward and said, "Kyla, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss, didn&rsquo;t we already make things very clear last time? I'm going to pick Nelson up. Please step aside," she said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He said hoarsely, "I know I was wrong! I&rsquo;ve learned that you were wronged in that case. You never pushed Paisley Daniels down the stairs. I gullibly believed her and made you go to prison. I'm sorry. I'm sorry..."</p></div>
