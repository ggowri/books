        <h1>Chapter 4116</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina followed her friend's finger and saw a film crew shooting a period drama. The two actors being filmed were quite famous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Kit joining the "Game of Thrones" crew, it was a recent development. According to online rumors, the actor originally cast as the third male lead suddenly resigned due to personal reasons, so Kit was brought in as a last-minute replacement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like it really is the 'Game of Thrones' crew, but just because the crew is here doesn't mean Kit is," Tina said. After all, a film crew is usually divided into two groups, A and B, which may be filming in different locations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, it looks like Kit is really here!" Eugenia's voice suddenly became very excited, and she pulled Tina and said, "Look, that nanny car is Kit's car. He should be in the car!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina took a closer look at the nanny car and confirmed that it was indeed Kit's. The last time she was rumored to be dating Kit, he was in this car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my god, this is too lucky. We can actually see Kit today! It's so worth it!" Eugenia shouted, "When they take a break later, let's go ask for autographs and photos. Do you think they'll give them to us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia was already thinking about what to do next, but Tina raised the collar of her jacket and pulled down the sun hat on her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't let anyone recognize her here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, the rumors about her and Kit that had just died down a few days ago would resurface if she was recognized near the "Game of Thrones" crew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, at that moment, the door of the nanny car opened, and a figure walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Kit!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina recognized him at a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Kit looked different from usual. He was wearing a black robe with golden totem embroidery, and a silver-white headband on his head. He looked colder and more beautiful than in modern clothes, with a hint of feminine charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It must be said that Kit's outfit was very eye-catching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia, who was beside Tina, exclaimed excitedly, "Wow, he's so handsome! Oh my god, he's even more handsome than the male lead in this movie. I bet that when the TV series airs, just with this look, he'll be the talk of the town!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't just Eugenia who praised Kit's look today. Tina noticed that there were many other girls around the set who were chattering and shouting. Some girls even took out their phones to take pictures, but they were stopped by the crew members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked at Kit in front of the nanny car. Because of her high position, she was looking down at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It must be said that ancient costumes really suit him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His ancient costume reminded her of the first time she saw him on screen in an ancient costume.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Tina was thinking, suddenly, Kit in front of the nanny car seemed to feel something and looked in Tina's direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, their eyes met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit frowned slightly, and his gaze seemed to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kit looked over here! Tina, do you think Kit recognized you?" Eugenia said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Kit looked up in her direction, the other girls who were paying attention to Kit around the set also looked over at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Danger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can't be recognized!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I need to go to the bathroom first." Tina found an excuse and hurried away.</p></div>
