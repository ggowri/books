        <h1>Chapter 966</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How good looking?" asked Hadwin as he raised his long eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I were 20 years younger, I'd pursue him right away! I wonder how many girls he's going to charm when he goes to kindergarten!" Lina tutted, immediately becoming a fan of the young boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin frowned. 'Handsome and cute... She would pursue him? Why does this sound so awkward?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you really go after him if you were 20 years younger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, you just haven't met him yet. Why don't you meet him the next time Grace takes him out? Grace says he's even more good-looking in person..." Lina stopped short. She finally realized that Hadwin did not look quite right, and as if she had come to a realization, she then said coquettishly, "Of course, no matter how handsome and cute he is, he's no match for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next second, she abruptly changed the subject before sighing to herself. 'I almost forgot how stingy and easily jealous he is!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I'm good-looking?" He peered at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes. He's no match for you. There&rsquo;s a saying that being bright at an early age does not necessarily bring success upon growing up. Those who are good-looking when they&rsquo;re young may not be good-looking when they grow up." She continued to butter him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In that case, do you think I wasn&rsquo;t that good-looking when I was a kid?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was rendered speechless. She was so mad at him. "No way. You must&rsquo;ve been handsome when you were a kid. Anyway, you look the best! You must know that I fell in love with you the moment I laid eyes on you. I just couldn&rsquo;t get you out of my mind all these years&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her throat ran dry as she spoke, and her own words of flattery made her speechless. They all said that women liked sweet talk, but it was the complete opposite when it came to them as Hadwin was the one who liked it more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pity her. She was so tired of it sometimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, since she liked him, she could only bear with it and coax him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Hadwin knew Lina was just buttering him up and it was not at all true, he could not help feeling happy hearing her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he did not stop her and let her keep on talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, Lina had already finished all the drinks in front of her but Hadwin did not look like he was planning to stop her. Lina could only lick her lips and gulped. "Well, do you get me? You really are the best-looking man in my heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ever since I was little?" he asked nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded non-stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've never seen me as a kid, have you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her head that was nodding so quickly stopped suddenly. "Why don't you give me a photo of yourself as a child and I'll keep it with me at all times?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He nodded. "Sure. I'll give you a picture of me as a kid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was rendered speechless. &lsquo;Is he really going to give me his photo?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she thought about how cute he must have been when he was a kid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Lina began to look forward to Hadwin's photo as a kid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart got heavier and heavier as Baldwin's trial drew near.</p></div>
