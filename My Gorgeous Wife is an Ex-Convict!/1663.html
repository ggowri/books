        <h1>Chapter 1661</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Anthony Sherman had never expected to become the object of Hadwin Stephenson's jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "Mr. Stephenson, if you still have feelings for Lina, then I'm not the one you should ask this. It's Lina. Even if I intend to be with Lina, it won't work if Lina doesn't choose me. Similarly, if you still have feelings for her but she doesn't choose you, you can't be with her either. It's all up to Lina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pressed her thin lips together tightly. "I'm only asking if you're going to be with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman sighed. It seemed he could not leave if he did not provide him an answer. "Lina is a good woman. If we like each other, I naturally want to be with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you can love her enough to do anything for her, then you deserve to be with her. Otherwise, you have no right!" Hadwin Stephenson spoke as if it was a warning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? If I don't love Lina enough to do anything for her, are you going to stop me from being with her, Mr. Stephenson?" asked Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson did not reply, but his cold expression already gave away the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Stephenson, can you do anything for Lina? If so, then you can pursue Lina again. I told you, it's all up to Lina," said Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson's expression instantly changed after saying that. He grabbed Anthony Sherman's collar and glared at him. "You know nothing. Do you think I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stopped speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson loosened his grip in despair. The eyes that were full of jealousy instantly became gloomy. "You'd better be loyal to Lina. Otherwise, I'll make your life a living hell. I, Hadwin Stephenson, mean what I say!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, Hadwin Stephenson turned around and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If... If Lina wants to be with Anthony Sherman, then maybe I should just give them my blessing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I&rsquo;ll give Lina my blessing and let her live the life she wants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'As for myself... Perhaps not being able to get what I want is the best punishment for me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman looked at Hadwin Stephenson's back and heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had shuddered when Hadwin Stephenson said the last sentence. He knew the man was serious. The man's expression and tone seemed to be telling him that he would kill him if he did Lina wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Hadwin Stephenson... is still deeply in love with Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'In that case, why won't Hadwin Stephenson pursue Lina again but telling me such things?' Anthony Sherman was full of doubts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's life began to return to normal. She learned that the design firm had fired Holly Greer when she went back to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You know what? I heard that Holly Greer shot the video of you entering and exiting the hotel. She then sold it to the reporters and gossip account!" A colleague told Lina the gossip they knew. "I didn't expect Holly Greer to be someone like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Another colleague said, "You didn't expect it? I knew it all along. Holly Greer's really mean. She wanted Lina dead by doing that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know, right? Fortunately, Lina is alright now. Holly Greer is now suffering the consequences of her actions! The director did a good thing by firing her. The office has one less black sheep now<span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>!"</p></div>
