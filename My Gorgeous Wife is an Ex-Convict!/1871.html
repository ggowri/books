        <h1>Chapter 1869</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He regretted the mistake he made countless times. He constantly wondered whether their fate could have been rewritten if he had helped her when she came to ask him for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps... it was like what Grace said. The one she loved would always be Jason no matter what he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Brian's phone rang. He picked it up to look and frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This number rarely called him, unless...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Brian answered it and heard a voice on the other end of the line saying, "Young Master Hart, someone came with the amethyst flower and asked us to track down two people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Brian's hand clenched slightly as he held the phone. He ordered the person, "Give that person whatever she wants."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I understand, Young Master Hart." The call ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Brian looked down at his phone with a flicker of thought in his eyes. He had left the address just in case Grace would encounter any trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not expect her to go there so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is Jason unable to help her track down the two people she's looking for? What happened between her and Jason?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, there was a knock on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Brian looked up and said, "Come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The office door opened, and the secretary led a young Asian woman into the office. "President Hart, the person you wanted to see is here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, you can leave first," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The secretary left the room, and the Asian woman looked anxiously at Brian with a faint look of anticipation on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Brian quietly peered at the person in front of him. She was thin and had long black hair. Her hair was not in a ponytail like when she first met him but a trendy wavy hairstyle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The woman had exquisite makeup on her face and wore bright red lipstick as if she was trying her best to show off her beauty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, in Brian&rsquo;s opinion, the woman looked better without makeup. It was because the makeup had destroyed her quiet elegant charm, especially her eye makeup. She had almond-shaped eyes similar to Grace, but it was now almost impossible to make out any resemblance after she did all this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Brian said indifferently, "You don't have to wear any makeup in front of me. And have you gone through the contract my secretary gave you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Y-Yes," the woman whispered as she blushed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can tell me if there's anything you're dissatisfied with," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, I have nothing to complain about," the woman said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, we'll go to the lawyer's firm and sign this contract tomorrow. I'll find the best gynecologist here to carry out the in vitro fertilization procedure. If there's any damage to your body, I&rsquo;ll compensate you as per the contract," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well... it doesn't have to be so troublesome. I can just..." The woman's face turned a little redder. She was trying to say something but stopped. However, it was clear that she did not want to undergo a medical procedure and wanted to get pregnant in a more traditional way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, it was how she could get more intimate with the man in front of her.</p></div>
