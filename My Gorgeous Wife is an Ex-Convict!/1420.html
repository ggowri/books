        <h1>Chapter 1419</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You'll find out when you see them," Grace said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Then Martin Weiss will know just how much he owes Kyla and how badly he ruined her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What can Martin Weiss possibly do to compensate for these?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Maybe it's just like what Jay said. Once Martin Weiss finds out about the truth, he might live in regret and pain for the rest of his life.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once they got to the hospital&rsquo;s entrance, Martin Weiss followed Grace into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car was driving slowly on the road, and Martin Weiss suddenly asked out loud, "Did you arrange for Shane Currey to appear in the ward?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," said Grace. Regarding Shane Currey, Jay had kept an eye on him when he helped her investigate the matter of the bone marrow donation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, she knew everything about Shane Currey and Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had planned on telling Martin Weiss after sorting out all the evidence but did not expect it to be too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss pondered for a moment before saying, "So you already know about the bone marrow donation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace replied, "Yeah. I also mentioned to Kyla that it was probably you who received her bone marrow and asked her if she wanted to tell you, but she said you would just take it as a lie even if she did."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss seemed to feel a pang in his heart and was ashamed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did Kyla... see right through me? She knew I wouldn't believe her! How did she feel when I scolded her again and again, accusing her of being malicious and even forcing her to apologize?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car stopped in front of a detention center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Martin Weiss got out of the car, he looked at Grace in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why did she bring me here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Who here is related to Kyla's case?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss followed Grace to the meeting room where he saw a vaguely familiar face. He heard Grace say, "This man was Paisley Daniels's attending doctor back then. He was responsible for Paisley Daniels's abortion operation after she fell down the stairs. He went to court and testified that Paisley Daniels had miscarried, just like you had."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, Grace turned to the man and said, "Be honest and tell Mr. Weiss what you did back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes... Yes, I will," he said. He had already been arrested, and he might not be able to get out if he did not answer honestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Staring at the man in front of him, Martin Weiss felt a sudden panic in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had experienced this kind of panic before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had felt the same way when Grace told him that Kyla was the one who donated her bone marrow to save his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now... he had the same feeling again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It is as if his physical instinct was afraid that what he would hear next was something he could not take, that it would be a truth that would make him more miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Paisley Daniels paid me, so I said what she wanted me to say. She was not pregnant at the time. I was instructed by her to say all those things in court.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he opened his mouth and said these words, Martin Weiss only felt his heart sinking.</p></div>
