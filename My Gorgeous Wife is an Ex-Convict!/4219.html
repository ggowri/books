        <h1>Chapter 4217</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lina and Hadwin came to the hospital in the morning and found out that Tina already knew the truth, they couldn't help but worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't we agree to wait until she recovers a bit and then tell her? Can she handle knowing all this now? What if she can't accept it..." Lina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry!" Chandler apologized with guilt, "I couldn't hold back in the moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but blurt it out because he was too jealous. Jealous that the person who used to love him so much now had thoughts for another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadwin patted Chandler's shoulder, understanding his feelings as a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that it's already like this, let's think about how to help Tina accept it better," Hadwin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina sighed and said to the two men, "I'll go in and talk to Tina. Leave her to me." After that, she walked into the ward, leaving the two big men outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina entered the ward and looked at her daughter, calling out with heartache, "Tina..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina turned her head and looked at Lina. There was a complicated expression on her face. After a while, she spoke, "Are you really my mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears immediately filled Lina's eyes, "Yes, I am your mother. You don't know how happy your father and I were when we found out you were still alive, Tina. I know you've lost your memory, and even if you don't recognize me right away, it's okay. Your father and I can wait patiently. Whether you have your memory or not, you're still our daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt a pang of heartache seeing the tears in the woman's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't like it when this woman cried. It felt like it would make her uncomfortable if the other person cried!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom!" Tina shouted. She believed, believed that this woman was really her mother because the intense feeling the woman had for her couldn't be faked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina's tears couldn't be stopped anymore. They kept rolling down from her eyes as she hugged Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Mom, Mom is here!" This was her child! From the moment she carried her in her womb, she vowed to protect her child!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I know I should believe what you and Dad said, but I still want to see Kit. I want to hear everything from his own mouth," Tina said. "I have to hear it from him personally before I can believe it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he was the one who rescued her from the abyss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her daughter's determined expression, Lina knew that she had to let Tina see Kit, that only when she saw Kit and heard the truth from his own mouth would she accept this reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom!" Seeing Lina hesitate, Tina said again, "I want to see Kit. Let me see him. </span><span>Whether he deceived me or not, I need to hear the answers from his own mouth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina finally nodded, "Okay, I'll let you see him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tina relaxed her brows and soon fell asleep due to exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina left the ward and relayed Tina's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She wants to see Kit," Lina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, we can't let her see that guy again!" Hadwin objected. "He deceived Tina and caused her to have an accident. Who knows what bad things will happen if Tina goes to see him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no matter what, if it weren't for him, Tina might still be suffering in that small village. He was the one who brought Tina out of the village. And the police also said that when the accident happened, if it wasn't for Kit using his body to protect Tina, her injuries might have been even worse, maybe even fatal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if he hadn't lied when he found Tina, how could Tina have had the accident? I didn't directly report him to the police and have him arrested. That was already letting him off lightly!" Hadwin became even angrier when talking about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of the married couples wanted to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Chandler made a concession, "Then let Tina see him."</span></p></div>
