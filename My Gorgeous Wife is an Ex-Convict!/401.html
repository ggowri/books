        <h1>Chapter 400</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was impossible to say no. By the time Grace came to herself, she was already in bed with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed. &lsquo;All right, let's just sleep together.&rsquo; It was not like they had not slept like this before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as she laid in bed, she was not sleepy because of his presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace could only find something to say, "Why do you still call me Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you like me calling you that?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated. "Not really, I just think... Uh, it seems a bit weird to call me that since we&rsquo;re already dating." If outsiders who did not know about their relationship heard him call her that, they might think that she was his sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was already used to it. After all, he had been calling her this since the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I call you Grace in front of people? As for the term Sis... it'll just be between you and me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... You seem to like calling me Sis,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Because it's the first time someone asked me to call her Sis.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was suddenly embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When I call you Sis, it's like there's a constant connection between us," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A flicker of doubt came into her eyes as she did not understand what he meant by constant connection. However, he made no further reply. He only said to her, "Now, go to sleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She responded and closed her eyes without making any intention of turning off the lamp at the bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced at the bedside lamp, and there was a flash of complication in his expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they were in the rental house, she used to sleep with the lights on because turning off the lights would make her feel afraid and remind her of some bad memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, he knew the bad memories were the things that had happened to her in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, for a while, she was able to turn off the lights and go to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she said, "I'm not that scared anymore because I have you by my side, Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now she had reverted to sleeping with the lights on again. Was it because his identity once again frightened her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did that mean if she went to bed with the lights off, her heart had once again accepted him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she was now dating him and she even said she liked him, he was not sure how he ranked in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was probably not as important as her best friend, Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart could not help but feel jealous at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When am I going to be the most important person in your life, Sis?" His gentle voice was low and drifted through the room while his eyes gazed silently at her face under the light of the lamp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time he called her Sis, it was like they were really family. It was as if they could not be separated no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was giving himself an extra layer of security, fearing that one day, they would not be related at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether she thought of him as a lover or a family member, he wanted to be someone she could not let go of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was because he knew what abandonment tasted like. He was once abandoned by his own mother. This time, he would not let her abandon him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Certainly not!</p></div>
