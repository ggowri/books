        <h1>Chapter 3517</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard that you and Mason had a falling out over this matter, so you should take a good look at it," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica flipped through the pages, and her emotions rose and fell with each turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All the evidence, as well as the perpetrator's confession, all indicate that the kidnapping case was initially Lionel's doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel designed a fake kidnapping, and the testimony of other nightclub patrons and unrelated individuals can corroborate this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In addition, the messages sent by Lionel were never actually delivered, as telecom records show that Mason had already blocked Lionel's number several days before the kidnapping occurred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So... Mason had no idea about the kidnapping case from beginning to end! It was just Lionel's mistake to think that he knew!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Veronica looked at the document in front of her, tears welled up in her eyes and fell onto the paper with a pitter-patter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Jasper said, Mason... no matter what, he couldn't bear to hurt her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she knew what kind of person he was, she knew that even if Lionel had proposed something to him beforehand, he would have scorned such behavior and even stopped it if he found out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why did she choose not to believe him at that time?! Why did she do that?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since he didn't know about the kidnapping beforehand, why...why didn't he want to explain to me the reason why he was the first one to arrive at the scene?" Veronica murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason sighed, "It seems like he didn't have a chance to tell you. I've told him before that some things need to be explained as soon as possible, or it might be too late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Too late? What does that mean?" Veronica was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason didn't explain, but his gaze fell on the necklace hanging around Veronica's neck. "This necklace, Mason gave it to you, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's a small tracker on the necklace that can connect to his phone. He can know where you are," Jason said. "He was supposed to tell you about it, but he was waiting for the right time. It seems like he never got that chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's a tracker in the necklace?" Veronica lowered her head in surprise and touched the pendant on her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If there was a place to put a tracker, it would be in this pendant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remembered when he gave her the necklace and said, "As long as Veronica wears this necklace, I'm not afraid of losing her. No matter where you are, I can always find you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you need to find me? Just call me," she had said back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if your phone dies and I can't reach you? I'm afraid that one day Veronica will abandon me, so...if I can find Veronica, even if you really do abandon me, I can still find you."</p></div>
