        <h1>Chapter 1903</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace frowned. It was indeed unusual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did she say she met who the friend was?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney said, "No. Grace, do you think something happened to Lina? She's pregnant and was just discharged from the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll find a way to see if I can contact Lina. Don't worry. I'll call you later." After the call with Mrs. Sweeney, Grace pondered about it and made a phone call, asking someone to help her pull the surveillance footage from the women&rsquo;s hospital to see which friend Lina had left with. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although Jason was quarreling with her, he did not remove the personnel he assigned to her. Hence, she could still request the help of those people as Mrs. Reed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she called the police, the police would not bother with her since the adult had not been missing for 24 hours. Besides, Lina had also called Mrs. Sweeney to explain why she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The personnel Jason assigned to Grace was great and efficient. They only took about half an hour before getting what she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at the footage they sent and instantly recognized the woman who walked up to Lina and talked to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although the woman was wearing a hat and sunglasses, and the footage was not that clear, Grace could still identify her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What confused her was that Lina followed Katherine Jackson into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Lina knows Katherine Jackson almost killed her and the baby in her belly. The police are looking for Katherine Jackson as well. Katherine Jackson is dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'How could Lina get into Katherine Jackson's car? What was Lina thinking? Or... did Katherine Jackson tell Lina something?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the personnel reported that the surveillance footage only captured the car driving out of the women's hospital before passing two blocks and then going into an alley. The alley did not have any surveillance cameras, so they could only pull some surveillance footage from nearby shops. The process might take a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Keep looking for her. We must find Lina no matter what!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the other hand, Jason was in a video conference with the company's senior executives, who fearfully gave presentations. They were afraid that one of them might accidentally piss off the boss again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jason was absent-minded. He hardly slept last night, not because he did not want to sleep but because he could not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if the bed was cold without her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Whenever he closed his eyes, what she said last kept repeating in his ears... "Jason, believe it or not, you'll never meet another woman who will love you more than I do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It... was as if he was possessed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason put down the pen in his hand and felt indescribably tired. He closed his eyes slightly, raised his hand, and gently rubbed his brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Don't think about what she said! Don't give it another thought! Don't believe her either. Because once I believe it, I&rsquo;ll only keep being a loser. Then I have to worry about her betraying me again sometime in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If you have no expectations, then you won't be disappointed or in despair!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said to himself. However, her voice seemed to ring in his ears again the next moment.</p></div>
