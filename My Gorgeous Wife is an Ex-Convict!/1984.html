        <h1>Chapter 1982</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The number of netizens interested in the topic increased and the post went viral.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina gaped at the post. Although the post did not name anyone, they had uncovered everything about her and Hadwin Stephenson. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, the post was now so viral but Anthony Sherman did not deny anything, seemingly acknowledging what the netizens had uncovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina could not help recalling Anthony Sherman's strange phone call today. 'Was he apologizing... for this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... the baby in my belly has nothing to do with Anthony Sherman. Why would he say that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked up and saw Hadwin Stephenson also holding a phone while looking at the trending post. His beautiful face seemed gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's heart suddenly seemed to have skipped a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin... The baby in my belly really isn't Anthony Sherman's. I swear nothing's going on between us..." Lina eagerly tried to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson only looked up at the secretary and said, "Go out and reject whoever is asking for an interview. Also, tell the company's employees to know what they should and should not say!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," the secretary replied and quickly walked out of the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The huge office was suddenly quiet again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was so quiet Lina could feel her own breathing and heartbeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Hadwin... didn't misunderstand, did he? Would he think something's going on between Anthony Sherman and me and that I'm fooling him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had no idea why Anthony Sherman, who had helped her so much, would do something like that. However, she was scared of Hadwin misunderstanding her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want them to argue over a misunderstanding and separate again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's lips quivered. She knew she should explain, but her voice seemed to be stuck in her throat. She could not even utter a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked up, only to see Lina's pale face. She had large beads of sweat on her forehead. When he raised his hand to wipe them away, she began trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He froze. "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I..." Her lips moved, but there was palpable fear in her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did the way I look just now scare you?" His rage subsided when he realized it. He got up and said, "I'll arrange someone to take you home while avoiding those reporters. Wait for me to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, before he could take more than two steps, she suddenly grasped his hand. "I'm not afraid of what you looked like just now. I'm just afraid you'll misunderstand!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She went all out and said it. Then, she took two deep breaths. Yes, her greatest fear was them having another misunderstanding!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She gripped his hand with a quiver. It was as if she was afraid that things would go back to the way they were when they had so many misunderstandings if she let go of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's gaze moved from her trembling hand to her pale cheeks. Her round eyes were misty, making his heart ache.</p></div>
