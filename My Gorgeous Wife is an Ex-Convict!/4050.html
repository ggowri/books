        <h1>Chapter 4048</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick and Nancy's wedding ended, and their new home was set up in Mick's private villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for their daughter, she was taken care of by Grace and the nanny at the Reed family's place tonight. When it was quiet late at night, the new home finally calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Finally, it's just the two of us." Mick said softly, "You must be tired today. Your body has just recovered not long ago, and we've been busy all day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if I'm a little tired, I'm still very happy." Nancy smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With such a grand wedding, she felt like a princess, welcoming her prince charming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything felt like a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick suddenly picked up Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" She exclaimed, instinctively wrapping her arms around Mick's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He carried her to the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy turned her head to look at the bed, her face blushing slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today is our wedding night." Mick's voice became hoarse, "So you need to be mentally prepared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of mental preparation?" Nancy was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It means..." He paused, gently placing her on the bed and pulling down the zipper of her wedding dress, "Tonight, I won't just want you once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's face instantly turned even redder!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During this period, he restrained himself and refrained from having sexual relations with her, fearing that it would affect her recovery. Sometimes, they could go for a week or two without any intimacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, she even thought that he had lost interest in her, and her mind was filled with various unfounded thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the misunderstanding was eventually cleared up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she assured him that everything was fine, her doctor had checked her physical condition and confirmed that normal sexual activity between husband and wife was completely possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he still restrained himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even during sex, he was always gentle and considerate, and after she was satisfied, he would quickly end it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if he was just trying to please her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Nancy's wedding dress slipped off in no time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her skin was exposed under the light, and it caught his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was completely absorbed, kissing every inch of her skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every inch belonged to him, and he was so infatuated with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had never thought that he would be so infatuated with a woman before. Even his father and younger brother had their own loved ones, but he still thought he would be the exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he didn't think there was a woman who could truly make him fall in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when he met her, he realized that a person could quickly enter his heart, make him worry, make him feel pain, and make him want to do something for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she fell off the cliff, his pain almost engulfed him completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she didn't survive, then perhaps even if he lived, he would only be a madman.</p></div>
