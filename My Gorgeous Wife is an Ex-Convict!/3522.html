        <h1>Chapter 3520</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow family was completely panicked when they found out that Mason had suddenly gone abroad and Veronica couldn't be reached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could this happen? It must be because you angered Mason that day, Veronica. You must apologize to Mason properly and not let him turn against our family. Otherwise, your brother will be in big trouble! Who knows if the Reed family will let him off the hook and put all the blame on your brother?" said stepmother Rosalind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer also chimed in, "Yes, Veronica, you can't let your brother go to jail. You need to make up with Mason so that the Reed family can help us. Then Lionel can also be cleared of charges!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt a chill in her heart and said to her father and stepmother, "Mason is not guilty at all! He had no idea about the kidnapping from start to finish. It was all Lionel's plan from the beginning!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is that possible? Lionel clearly said that Mason knew about it! And the biggest beneficiary of this whole thing is him!" Rosalind said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica sneered, her nose becoming more bitter, "The biggest beneficiary isn't it the Barlow family? At that time, I was in a cold war with him. Weren't you all afraid that once my relationship with him broke down, the Barlow family would lose the protection of the Reed family and wouldn't be able to get money and connections like before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This sentence immediately changed the expression of the Barlow family couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, how can you say such a thing?" Archer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why can't I say it?" Veronica retorted, "I know this truth, and Lionel naturally knows it too. He was able to be called 'young master' and 'big brother' by a group of older gangsters at such a young age. How did he do it? Don't you know? He planned this whole thing alone, and when I was about to go find him, he sent a message to Mason, dragging him down with him. He thought that by doing this, he could get away with it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can you say that about your younger brother?" Rosalind expressed her dissatisfaction, "Don't you believe what your brother said?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You all witnessed Lionel's mental state at that time. How much of what he said can be trusted? I believe what Mason said more than Lionel," Veronica said without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, she should have done this earlier. She should have believed Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she realized it too late!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can you say such a thing? Don't forget, Lionel is your own brother!" Archer rebuked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Lionel is my younger brother, and you are my biological father, but your care for me is far less than Mason's. He is the one who is my family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Smack!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A slap landed directly on Veronica's face, causing her cheek to burn with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up!" Archer shouted in anger. "Anyway, you better make up with Mason quickly. If anything happens to Lionel this time, I'll hold you responsible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica, however, seemed to feel no pain at all. She just lifted her hand and tightly grasped the pendant hanging from her necklace around her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can they make up? As long as Mason comes back and she can see him, they will make up, won't they?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, every time they had a fight before, they made up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her making up is not for anyone else, but for herself. She...doesn't want to become a stranger to him in the future. Even if they have different directions in their feelings towards each other, maybe they will eventually find a direction that suits them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However...although she thinks this way in her heart, why does that uneasy feeling seem to be getting stronger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And his words - "From now on, you are not my Veronica!" - keep lingering in her ears and won't go away!</p></div>
