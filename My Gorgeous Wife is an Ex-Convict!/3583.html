        <h1>Chapter 3581</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you like it?" William guessed from her focused expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," Jasper nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me take a picture for you," William offered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I can take it myself," Jasper declined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there a difference between my photo and yours? Besides, it's been a while since I gave you a gift you like. If you like this, let me take a good picture for you," he insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William thought to himself, maybe when she looks at this composed music, she will also think of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the host announced the start of the auction with a starting price of $100,000, William immediately raised his sign. After several rounds of bidding, the final price settled at $1.2 million.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the sheet music is indeed authentic, then $1.2 million is not too expensive. However, if it is not authentic, then it is really not worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at the final price and playfully stuck out her tongue. "Will your allowance be enough for this purchase? If not, I can lend you some."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At home, their mother sets a monthly allowance for them to prevent them from developing a habit of spending recklessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although they also have an unlimited card, they usually do not use it unless there are special circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William chuckled, "After I went to college, my family's money could be used freely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked, "Did Uncle Barlow allow you to use the Barlow family's money freely?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he replied, "My father let me gradually take over some of the family's business, and I also have other investments that make money, so I have quite a bit of money with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked again. They were the same age, but she was still spending her family's money while he... had already invested and made money. There really was a gap between people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" He looked at her change in expression and couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just... all of a sudden, you seem like a grown-up," she muttered. It was like she was still standing in the same spot while he had already moved forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't that a good thing?" he looked at her gently. "Growing up means becoming stronger and being able to protect the people and things you care about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper couldn't help but smile at his words. "Yes, it is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they exchanged smiles, Roger, who was standing in a nearby corner, watched them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his eyes, there was a hint of jealousy that he didn't even realize he had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This sheet music was anonymously donated by him. Jasper was indeed moved by it, and William didn't hesitate to buy it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A million-dollar fortune, just to win a smile from the princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After today, this will probably become a story that people love to talk about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tragedy of the Abbott family has long been forgotten by people's memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper... why is she desperately searching for Lawrence? Is it just to ease her own conscience?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Lawrence were still alive, then her sense of guilt would be lighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this thought, a mocking smile appeared on Roger's lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After several more auctions, it was Jasper's donated item's turn.</p></div>
