        <h1>Chapter 2514</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, all she could do now was watch her baby through a glass wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only hoped the baby was strong enough to survive this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, Kyla, have you chosen a name for the baby yet?" Grace asked as she sat beside her hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I have." Kyla finally smiled at the mention of her daughter's name. "Her name is Trista."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ye?" Grace was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, her surname is Ye," Kyla answered affirmatively. She wanted the child... to have the surname Ye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Which 'Si'?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The 'Si' that means thoughtful," replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace understood that the &lsquo;Si&rsquo; probably meant longing. Kyla had never shown any emotions toward Martin Weiss's departure, but... she probably missed Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to say her love for Martin Weiss was not enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the depths of one&rsquo;s affection could change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could Kyla's feelings for Martin Weiss not be deep enough? Kyla had no idea that the liver in her body was donated to her by Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them were already inextricably intertwined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving Kyla's ward, Grace asked Jason, "How's Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "He's still hospitalized, but he&rsquo;ll probably have to stay in the hospital for a while. Besides, he needs to recuperate for a long time afterward. The liver donation almost killed him. I later learned that there were some risks during the operation. He was lucky to have survived it. Otherwise, he probably wouldn&rsquo;t have made it off the operating table."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope when Kyla recovers and Trista is removed from the intensive care unit, Kyla will move on from the hurdle in her heart and get back together with Martin Weiss again," said Grace. Martin Weiss had given so much to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Martin Weiss had made mistakes, he had paid the price for them over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They&rsquo;ll be together if Kyla has the intention to do so," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But will Martin Weiss... be willing? After all, his affection for Kyla isn't what it once was," Grace said with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He even risked his life to save Kyla. How could he be unwilling? Forgetting feelings through hypnosis only makes you think so, but how can you forget something so unforgettable? In the end, it all depends on whether Kyla is willing to take that step." Jason pointed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope Kyla and Martin Weiss will have a happy ending and that Amber Mitchell will find new evidence as soon as possible so that Louise Mitchell won&rsquo;t be able to escape justice," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Is there another twist in Amber Mitchell's case?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The doctors who were involved in the case changed their statements. Their testimonies are only about Amber Mitchell's father and stepmother. They excluded Louise Mitchell. The Gregory family must have done something to take the blame off Louise Mitchell," Grace analyzed the situation and spoke.</p></div>
