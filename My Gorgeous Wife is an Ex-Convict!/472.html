        <h1>Chapter 471</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... Nothing. I just remembered that I'm going to visit Grandma tomorrow, and I haven't bought anything yet," Grace said. In actually fact, she had bought a few things, but the Atkinson family had thrown them into the trash can.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"About that, I bought them for you and left them on the coffee table," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the coffee table in her room and saw a familiar packaged bag. It was... the same packaging bag she had received when she bought the pastries at the mall that day. Had he... bought the same ones?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are they the ones I bought today?" Grace asked breathlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I bought a few extra ones," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you know what... uh, what I bought?" Grace asked doubtfully. Even if Jason had watched the video, the most he could have seen was the packaging bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just checked their transaction statement history and found out what you bought," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It explained the matter. Grace finally understood that such things might not be that easy for the others but were easy for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I yelled abruptly just now. Did I bother you?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's nothing you can do to bother me." Jason crouched down beside her bed. "You're my number one priority, no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the man in front of her. Now, he was not so high up as he used to be. He was even&hellip; looking at her with his head up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the person who was high up in the sky had become her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace downstairs to get something to eat and watched as the latter gulp downed what was supposed to have been dinner but was now a midnight snack. His eyes darkened slightly as he thought of the phone call Harold had made to him before she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold seemed as if he wanted to test how much he cared about Grace. Throughout the call, he did not stop mentioning the car accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If not because of the car accident... back then, why was he so uneasy in front of her? It was as if he was afraid that she would discover the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would make the Atkinson family pay for the justice they owed Grace. He would also clear her name because that was what he owed her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like that?" Suddenly, the person who had been eating with her head lowered was looking up at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. I just think it's great looking at you like this," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, it was great being able to see her up close, right next to him, and quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At last, he had someone he desperately wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Grace got up and set off with Jason to the town her grandmother lived in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before leaving the house, Grace called her grandmother once more and gave her an estimated time of arrival. Over the phone, Grace&rsquo;s grandmother sounded lively. Hence, she was vaguely reassured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Presumably, her grandmother's current physical condition should be all right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, not wanting to enter the town in such a high profile, Grace took the opportunity to ask Jason if the car they drove could be a little more normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To no avail, the most normal car the Reed family had was a BMW that cost about 2 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed. All right, a car worth two million was considered pretty good for the average person. However, it has to be said that for Jason, the vehicle seemed as "normal" as it could be.</p></div>
