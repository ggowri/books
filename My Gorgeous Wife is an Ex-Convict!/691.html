        <h1>Chapter 690</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm sorry!" She apologized quickly. The pain in her wrist was easing her headache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why&rsquo;d you touch me? Why&rsquo;d you call me by that name? Grace, do you really have no feelings for me at all?" His eyes were fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face paled and reddened. "You&hellip; You&rsquo;ve misunderstood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Misunderstood?" He chuckled suddenly."Then tell me what kind of misunderstanding will make you call me by my nickname again and again, and even touch my face with your hand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lower lip. For a moment, she did not know what to say, so she could only say, "It's not what you think. I won't do it again. I had a headache, and I mistook you for someone else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mistook me? Was calling me by the name &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo; a mistake too?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not the only one in the world called &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;," she retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Lina was already in the vicinity. Seeing her, Grace said to Brian, "My friend&rsquo;s here. Let go of me. I need to get off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian listened, but his dark phoenix eyes kept staring at Grace. The atmosphere in the car seemed to be stretched to the limit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Brian released his fingers and Grace immediately opened the door, stepping out of the car. Then, she said to her friend who was looking for her not far away, "Lina, I'm here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina heard her and looked over. Then, she jogged toward Grace. When she was about to reach Grace's side, a luxury car behind Grace pulled away. Lina suddenly thought that the person in the driver's seat&hellip; Looked a lot like Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, was that... Brian in the car behind you?" Lina asked with a surprised look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace did not hide it from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... How were you with Brian&hellip;? Why&rsquo;d you suddenly walk out of the bookstore?" Lina had only gone to the magazine section for a while and did not even go through half of the magazine when so many things happened. She struggled to keep up with the events.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then told Lina what happened earlier. Upon hearing this, Lina immediately called the man who chased after her best friend to film her shameless. Then, she said, "Why didn't you come to me? If I was there, I would&rsquo;ve kicked that guy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I went to find you, I wouldn't be the only one being filmed by the people around me. Do you want to be searched on the internet later?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you hadn't encountered Brian this time, you would've..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I would&rsquo;ve thought of other ways. Alright, let's not talk about it." Grace dragged her best friend to a nearby dessert shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ordering two desserts, Grace changed the topic and said, "By the way, if you dream a lot and it feels like you're dreaming about something from your childhood but you have no memory of it ever happening, could it be that you've heard someone else talk about it, so you dreamt about it? It&rsquo;d be easy to mistake those dreams for something that had happened to you in real life, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was almost dizzy when she heard this. 'What's all this?' It took awhile for her to sort things out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think I've heard of instances like this. Maybe it really happened but you've just forgotten about it? Isn't it often portrayed on TV?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You mean amnesia?" Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, partial amnesia. It's often mentioned in novels and TV shows. You can try hypnosis. Maybe you'll remember, but it's better to consult a professional doctor!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Hypnosis&hellip;' Grace showed traces of consideration in her almond eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to know what the dream was all about!</p></div>
