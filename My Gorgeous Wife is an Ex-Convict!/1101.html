        <h1>Chapter 1100</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had scratched Brian last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let... Let go..." When Dr. Russell was changing his needle knife, Grace said to Jason, "I'll end up scratching you when I&rsquo;m in pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what?" Jason raised his other free hand and gently wiped the sweat from her forehead. "Brian can get hurt for you, but I can't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze immediately. However, before she could speak again, Dr. Russell's needle knife stabbed her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The... The pain is so bad&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could do now was clench her teeth and endure the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A new layer of sweat quickly broke out on her forehead again, which had just been wiped dry earlier. Beads of sweat kept running down her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason just stared at Grace. Her fingernails were constantly scratching and digging into his flesh because of the pain. However, he seemed to feel no pain even when there were obvious bloodstains on the back of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Or rather, all he cared about was Grace right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was full of pain. She was suppressing and enduring it desperately. She clenched her teeth, and the veins on her forehead and the back of her hand popped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, when Dr. Russell finished the treatment, Grace felt like she was going to collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell said to Grace, "Okay, you'll have the third treatment in a week. Remember to keep the wounds dry for 24 hours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank... you." Grace was pale. She gasped and thanked him with some difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only at this moment did her eyes fall on her hand that was interlaced with Jason&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were bloodstains on the back of his hand, and she knew she was the one who caused them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt the pain in her fingers, not to mention the fact that Jason was the one who got scratched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their hands now seemed like they were glued together in a firm clasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace tried to pull her fingers away but realized she could not exert any strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the contrary, Jason carefully separated their hands. His face was a bit pale, displaying slight worry. He looked a bit gloomy too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He carried her in his arms and told Terrence, who was waiting nearby, "Send Dr. Russell back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason carried Grace out of the room and walked toward the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, you don't have to carry me like this. I just had my hands treated. It's not like I can't walk," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he carried her all the way to the couch where he placed her down carefully. "How about I try and get you a better doctor to treat your hands? That way, you won't have to suffer so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "No thanks. I believe in Dr. Russell. Besides, I can stand the pain. It's not the worst."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned. 'What does 'the worst' mean? Was it... the pain she had suffered in prison?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was her suffering back then more painful than the pain she was in today?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason could only feel the stinging in his heart again.</p></div>
