        <h1>Chapter 1825</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina closed her eyes in agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps it was fate that something happened to her at this timing and that the baby would leave her in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe it was for the best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If the child left, she would no longer have anything to do with Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car soon arrived at the hospital. While carrying Lina, Anthony Sherman quickly rushed into the hospital&rsquo;s emergency department. He concisely explained what had happened and said, "She's pregnant. There's a baby in her belly. Please save the baby at all costs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was put on the mobile bed and pushed to the emergency room. The doctor began to give Lina emergency treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman sat on a bench outside, waiting anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If Lina hadn't told me not to inform her parents before going in, I would've called Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But Lina didn't mention Hadwin Stephenson. Should I call Hadwin Stephenson?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman was at a loss for a moment. If he informed Hadwin Stephenson, then with Hadwin Stephenson's ability, he could find her better medical resources. She could get better treatment in case the treatment here was not effective.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As he was thinking about it, his phone suddenly rang. Anthony Sherman realized that the sound came from Lina's bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he got out of the car with her in his arms, he had also grabbed her bag from the passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He opened the bag and took out her phone, only to see a string of numbers. It meant Lina did not save this number on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He heard Hadwin Stephenson's voice when he pressed the answer button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina? Are you there?" Hadwin Stephenson's elegant voice sounded exhausted and hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman cleared his throat and said, "Mr. Stephenson, I'm Anthony Sherman. Lina is currently in the emergency room being treated by the doctor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The emergency room? What happened?" Hadwin Stephenson's voice immediately sounded anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina had a car accident in the morning. I happened to pass by and saw it, so I sent her to the hospital," said Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Which hospital?" asked Hadwin Stephenson. Once Anthony Sherman gave him the hospital's address, Hadwin Stephenson said, "I'll be right there!" He ended the phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman put the phone back into Lina's bag and continued to wait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before long, Lina was pushed out and was placed in a ward first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor said to Lina, "Your injuries aren't serious. You only have some bruises and no fractures. But you're eight weeks pregnant now. The baby's not doing so well. If you insist on keeping the baby, we recommend you to transfer to a women specialist&rsquo;s hospital. Otherwise, we would advise abortion as soon as possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I won&rsquo;t be keeping the baby. Doctor, please help me arrange for an operation," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What? You're having an abortion?" Anthony Sherman asked, shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina replied, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But don't you care about the baby very much? And it's not impossible if you want to keep the baby. I'll send you to Municipal Women's Hospital right away!" said Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, I've made up my mind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing that the two were arguing, the doctor immediately said, "Since the parents of the baby haven&rsquo;t come to a conclusion, you might as well think it over before making a decision."</p></div>
