        <h1>Chapter 1237</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he stopped Stella from calling him Bryn. The name was sealed in his memory like a taboo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was calling him Bryn again. She...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly remembered that the last time they were in the hospital, she had called him Bryn and told him that she was the little girl he met when he was a child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only at that time, he thought she said that to save Chase Harper! 'Could it be that... Could it be that...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, he dared not think more about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's voice continued saying, "You've saved my life more than once, and I'm grateful. I understand the feelings you have for me, but I can't give you a response. My feelings for you have never been love. Stop loving me, and don't waste your feelings on me anymore. As for the favor of saving me, I&rsquo;ll repay you when I have the chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What I need isn't your repayment!" said Brian. He stared at her closely and said in a trembling voice, "Tell me, are you... Are you the little girl I've been looking for?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it matter whether I am?" Grace said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You are, aren't you? You were the little girl, weren't you?" As he spoke, he tried to reach out and grab her, but another hand reached out sideways and blocked his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, a large hand grabbed Grace's waist and her back was pressed against a chest. A familiar scent filled her nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, what are you trying to do to my wife?" Jason's voice suddenly rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian shuddered. He straightened his back, and his phoenix eyes met Jason's deep dark ones. The word &lsquo;wife&rsquo; sounded so harsh. "I just want to know if she's the one I've been looking for!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haven't you found her already? What else is there to know?" Jason said lightly. His cold voice sounded sarcastic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face immediately turned paler. His thin lips were pressed together in a straight line, and his entire body tensed. Jason ignored Brian, lowered his head, and said to Grace who was in his arms, "Alright, you've said pretty much everything you wanted to say. It's time to go back to the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" Brian stood in front of them. "No one is leaving until you make it clear today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted an answer! He wanted to know the truth even though the answer might frighten him and cause him pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sneered, "Brian, since when do you have the right to command me? I can leave if I want to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men confronted each other, and the atmosphere was on the verge of breaking out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pressure around them became extremely uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick, who had retreated to the side, quickly stepped forward to lighten the mood. He said, "We&rsquo;ve known each other since childhood. What&rsquo;s with all this tension? Calm down. Why don't... I treat you guys? Let's sit down somewhere, have a cup of tea, and talk it over?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, neither Brian nor Jason paid any attention to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick touched his nose dully. 'Fine, they&rsquo;re treating me like I'm invisible!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said to Brian, "You should be glad that you saved Grace. Otherwise, you would be lying on the ground now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian did not seem to hear him. His eyes were just staring at Grace. "Are... you?" he asked again in a hoarse voice.</p></div>
