        <h1>Chapter 2356</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hesitated a little before saying, "Kyla, you and Martin Weiss don&rsquo;t have to go this far. Your health can't be too bad. Besides, it's been five years. Why don't we find a way to recover the feelings Martin Weiss has forgotten? Then you can..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. Just leave it at that. It's... good enough. I don't want him to risk his life for me again," said Kyla as she suppressed the sorrow to the bottom of her heart. She smiled faintly. "Lina, I've made up my mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing the smile on Kyla's face, Lina felt sadder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla... has feelings for Martin Weiss too. These two people who love each other can't be with each other.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One loved too much, while the other loved too little. Was there no way for them to be together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether it was deep or faint, it was still love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly changed the subject and said, "Whatever it is, Martin Weiss has promised to cooperate to get Jacqueline Bowman probation, so there's hope for Kyla to find out Amber Mitchell's whereabouts from Jacqueline Bowman. But Jacqueline Bowman seems to be getting away too easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else can we do? She refuses to say anything unless she&rsquo;s released," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I do have an idea, but it&rsquo;ll be difficult to implement it. And it&rsquo;ll require Martin Weiss's cooperation," said Grace, who did not want the law to let go of a perpetrator but also wanted to help Kyla find Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she could understand what Kyla was feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell us more!" Lina was interested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla also looked like she was waiting for her to go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace lowered her voice and told her two best friends the idea she had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes widened as she listened. Finally, she asked uncertainly, "Will it... work?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just happened to think of it. It should work if we set it up right, but we need many parties to cooperate with us. Also, Martin Weiss is the victim, so we need his cooperation in court. I just don't know if he'll agree to this. But it's the only way to uncover Amber Mitchell's whereabouts and bring Jacqueline Bowman to justice," said Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, "Kyla, why don't you give it a try? It&rsquo;ll be infuriating if people like Jacqueline Bowman are allowed to get away with their crimes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I'll go look for Martin Weiss again and see if I can convince him." After all, it would be troublesome for Martin Weiss to work with them to put on a show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had finally agreed to let Jacqueline go on probation, so she had no idea if persuading Martin Weiss to do this would lead to further complications.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she resented Jacqueline Bowman when she thought of how she had colluded with Mr. Lambert to kidnap her, which even led to Martin Weiss getting injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina clapped her hands and said, "Okay, that's settled, then! Why don't we do something entertaining since it&rsquo;s rare for us to get together?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it? Kyla is pregnant, and you have to look after your daughter. What can we do?" Grace said. Otherwise, they would not have gathered at Hadwin Stephenson's mansion. It was all so Lina could check on Tina Stephenson at any time she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tina Stephenson had the confinement lady and maids looking after her, but Lina had to check on the little one whenever she woke up.</p></div>
