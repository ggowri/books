        <h1>Chapter 3418</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she also reads some novels and watches girl anime, and feels curious and excited about the prince charming who will appear in her life in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her silence made his brows furrow, and he moved closer to her. "So, do you like that guy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica instinctively wanted to step back. Although he was two years younger than her, he was already half a head taller. His sudden approach made her feel inexplicably oppressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her footsteps only took a step back, but his hand had already wrapped around her waist, preventing her from moving back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you like that person?" he continued to ask, his forehead almost touching hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter whether I like that boy or not, you have no right to hit him," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I don't like it when you like someone else," he said. The mere thought of her liking someone else made him feel incredibly uncomfortable, as if something was stuck in his chest, making it hard for him to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica took a deep breath and said, "Mason, even if I fall in love with someone else, you will always be my family, my beloved brother. That will never change."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought he was afraid that she would fall in love with someone else and ignore him, so that's why they fought and she said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her explanation didn't ease his mind, instead it made him feel even worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will you fall in love with someone else?" he asked her, staring intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her heart, a sudden unease arose, feeling as though her answer would determine something important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I will also... um, have a boyfriend in the future, and then get married and have children, and form a family. But... as I said before, no matter what, you are still my family. My feelings for you will not diminish because of this. Mason, you are very important to me!" Veronica said, her lips seeming very dry as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze dimmed as if covered by something, "I am important to you, but do you have to fall in love with someone else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused for a moment, then said, "This...this isn't a contradiction or conflict. People...people have many different types of emotions. There's familial love, friendship, and...romantic love. The familial love between us won't change. Since you came to my house, I've already treated you like my own younger brother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Younger brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, he never felt anything was wrong when he heard the word "brother", but now, hearing it from her mouth, it sounded extremely unpleasant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if I don't want you to like someone else?" he asked. "Sister A, can you not like someone else? Just like me is enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is a different kind of liking, it doesn't conflict!" she said. "Besides, in the future, the person I like will definitely also like you. Is it not good to have one more person liking you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not good!" he said almost without thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He doesn't want her to like anyone else, nor does he want her to date or marry someone else in the future and start a family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It feels like if that happens, she won't belong to him exclusively anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, Veronica and Mason's conversation came to a close without any resolution.</p></div>
