        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily apologized with a sincere expression. She looked as if she was on the verge of collapse and gained a lot of sympathies.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a pause, she continued, "I'll go to the Sanitation Service Center to express my sincere gratitude to the sanitation workers who helped me. I'll also donate all of my income from this year's work and use it to set up a breakfast stall. The sanitation workers can get a free breakfast every day with their work pass."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once the video of the press conference was uploaded on the Internet, many people felt that Lily's crisis had been handled well. Even the fans kept posting endlessly to help Lily regain her previous &lsquo;darling&rsquo; image.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As a result, many people felt that this had indeed just been a misunderstanding.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily's gratitude towards the Sanitation Service Center was also very impressive and even attracted many reporters.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The director of the Sanitation Service Center arranged for the sanitation workers who had looked for the ring that day to shake hands with Lily one by one and to receive gifts that she had provisioned for each of them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Each worker had to line up for a press release in which they&rsquo;d accept Lily's gift of gratitude.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Claire took the gift and was very happy. This gift, in addition to the check for ten thousand dollars, had come with a down jacket. Looking at the label, she saw that it was a designer brand. She contemplated whether she&rsquo;d keep it or sell it online for more money.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Claire came back into the center and was surprised to see Grace. &ldquo;Hey, I was wondering where you were. Hurry and go outside. Everyone is lined up from the third shift. Lily is handing out gifts and cash compensation for her mistake. You worked harder than anyone. Go get what&rsquo;s due to you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Claire nudged Grace, who was sitting alone on the chair.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't need it." Grace smiled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This down jacket costs more than a thousand dollars. And the check is for 10k. Are you crazy?!? Why don't you want them?" Claire couldn&rsquo;t mask her disbelief.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace shook her head.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what you&rsquo;re thinking right now. Just take the things and leave, you'll be fine," Claire said. She directly pulled Grace up and walked towards the door.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"There's no need, Claire. There's really no need," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, before she could release herself from Claire's grasp, her entire person had already been pulled outside.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"There's still one left who didn't receive the gift!" Claire called out.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">All of a sudden, the cameras and the reporters were aimed at Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace automatically used her hands to block them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those cameras made her think of the time when she had been outside the court being swarmed and photographed by the media. The reporters had all been holding microphones and persistently wanting to interview her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And Sean at that time... Grace's eyes spotted Sean standing outside the frame of the cameras.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Three years ago, in prison, that man had stood there coldly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Lily had said that she was going to impair her hand, he had looked down at her fingers, which were already stained with spots of blood, and said "good" in a frosty tone.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Three years later at the country club, when his bastard friend Gregory had accosted her, he&rsquo;d also stood by.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were some things that, even after three years, remained the same.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace put down her hand and her heart seemed to calm down a little.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It&rsquo;s okay. You&rsquo;re okay.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She breathed deeply.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily was the one in the crossfire today, not her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This media circus wasn&rsquo;t out to condemn Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean stepped into her line of vision. He wouldn&rsquo;t break her gaze.</p></div>
