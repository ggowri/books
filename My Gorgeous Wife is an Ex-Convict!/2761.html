        <h1>Chapter 2759</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew what answer she would give him, but he went ahead and asked! It just gave him another heartache in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Heartache?' He was startled. His hand loosened suddenly, and the phone fell to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand covered his heart. Every heartbeat seemed to be tingling with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had already hypnotized his feelings. Why would his heart still ache for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop! Stop!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kept screaming to himself in his head, but the pain continued and did not stop...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the pain would continue as long as his heart kept beating...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A week later, Valda Theller and Brian went to the night market again to pick up the custom-made dolls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cartoon figures she drew were suitable for making dolls. They looked almost exactly like the ones she drew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the two dolls in her hands, Valda Theller smiled, looking happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian felt that the woman in front of him was easily content as he watched her. She looked like she had gotten something precious when all she had gotten was some cheap dolls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, the women he dated usually looked this happy because they had been given jewelry or good film resources.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, do you wanna watch a movie?" Valda Theller asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, is there a movie you'd like to watch?" Brian asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but... uh... it's an animated film." She hesitated and said. "Do you watch animated films?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Animated films?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not for kids. It's mainly for adults. The film is called Clear Blue Skies and is about..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller wanted to tell Brian about the main content of the film, but he said, "I know this animated film. Hart Group's film company invested in it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Valda Theller was dumbfounded. 'Is he one of the investors for the movie I want to watch?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you've seen the movie?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I haven't seen it. I've only read some written reports. Although Hart Group invested in them, I don't watch all the films I invest in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought about it and agreed. Hart Group invested in so many films. If he watched all of them, who knew when he could finish them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go and have a look," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The voice actors for the film are famous. The trailer looks good too. I think the country's animated films are slowly improving," Valda Theller said excitedly. After all, animation and comics were related. "I wonder if I can have the chance to direct a big-screen animated film like this one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want to be an animation director?" He seemed surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only have the thought, but I'm still a long way from it. It's a step-by-step process. Of course, I might end up just thinking about it." Valda Theller smiled lightly. After all, she was lucky enough to be doing what she loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Talent was only part of the process of becoming an animation director. A lot of it was luck.</p></div>
