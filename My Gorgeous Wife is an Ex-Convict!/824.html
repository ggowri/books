        <h1>Chapter 823</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you trying to argue with me? So what if we kick you out of here? Who do you think you are?" Lily naturally had someone to speak up for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want me to get out? Which law says I can't set foot in here? Must I scram when you tell me to? I'll tell you what, I can sue you for doing this!" Lina said stubbornly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sue me? Well, I'd like to see you sue me!" As she spoke, the man ordered his two subordinates beside him, &ldquo;Get her out of here so as not to upset Miss Atkinson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two strong men came and grabbed each of Lina's arms, trying to drag her out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Director Tong and several other colleagues did not dare to speak up on Lina&rsquo;s behalf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a faint smile on the corners of Lily's lips as she looked at Lina mockingly. "It seems that you have no choice but to get out of here. Grace may have someone to protect her, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have someone to protect you. From now on, I'll make sure you get kicked out every time you show your face."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's face turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had no way to fight in such a place. The more she struggled, the more she was embarrassed and humiliated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why&hellip; can people like Lily humiliate and torture others? Is it because she comes from a strong background?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like back then when Grace had her fingernails pulled out by Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was her only option to suffer when Lily humiliated her? Just because she was the daughter of the Atkinson family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when Lina was ready to give up struggling, a familiar sound rang suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? When did someone else get to decide whether my girlfriend is kicked out or not?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately shuddered. 'This voice&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, a tall figure caught her sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Hadwin!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina stared at the man who had suddenly appeared in front of her, only feeling her eyes heating up. Something seemed to surge out of her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin had already pulled her away from the two men grabbing her arms. Looking at her carefully, he said, "Are you alright? Did they hurt you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those inky eyes were full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina shook her head. "Why... are you here?" Her voice was somewhat choked when she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to cry when she was humiliated by Lily, but now that he had saved her, she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin gently caressed Lina's bangs. "Alright, don't cry. I'll have them pay for making you suffer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he went to the man who had his subordinates drag Lina out. "Apologize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That man did not recognize Hadwin, so he immediately said angrily, "Who the hell are you to make me&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before he could finish, Hadwin had already punched him to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man's subordinates wanted to come forward but were stopped by Hadwin's bodyguards.</p></div>
