        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's there to be angry about? The truth will speak for itself. Besides, the more you explain, the more the other person will think you're guilty," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley could only say, "By the way, is the person who drives the luxury car to pick you up every day your friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Veronica replied. In fact, Shirley had asked this question before and she had answered it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I saw that person, he's over 40 years old. How did you become friends with him?" Shirley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over 40 years old?" Veronica was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he comes to pick you up every day. He looks like he's over 40 years old. Does he just look old or what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few seconds of confusion, Veronica finally understood who Shirley was talking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's just my driver who comes to pick me up," Veronica explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your driver?" Shirley was shocked. "Oh my god, your friend has a driver too. Well, it's not surprising for someone who has a car like that. So how old is your friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's 18," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's two years younger than us. Is he a boy or a girl?" Shirley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a boy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so he's younger than you," Shirley said with a flirtatious expression. "Are you and your friend... um, really just friends?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face turned slightly red, and Shirley's gaze became even more flirtatious. "Oh, it seems like there's something going on. But with all the rumors going around school, even if you don't care, it will still have an impact on you. Why not have your friend come to school and show himself? Maybe it can quell those rumors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show himself?" If she really let Mason come to her school, then there might be even more rumors. Mason might even get involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Mason weren't really in a relationship, so it wouldn't be good to involve him in her affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's talk about it later," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her relationship with Mason was only a short period of time, then there was no need to have him come and quell the rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I was really curious to meet your friend," Shirley muttered. After all, at 18 years old, having a luxury car and a driver, what kind of rich young master was he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was even more handsome, he would be even more attractive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But at 18, he's only a freshman, right?" Shirley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a junior, he skipped grades," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see. Haha, well Veronica, keep working hard and try to win him over. Although there's a two-year age difference, these days there are a lot of sister-brother couples. And I feel like you're very suitable for that kind of relationship," Shirley patted Veronica's shoulder and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Suitable?" Veronica was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you look like the older sister type, emitting a kind of virtuous and motherly feeling, gentle yet independent and strong, and very good at taking care of people!" When they first met, Shirley was sick with a fever, and Veronica took good care of her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she thought that if she had a sister like Veronica, she would be really happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're making me sound too good," Veronica laughed. "But maybe I really am more suited to being an older sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just don't know if her sister and Mason can really have a relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although their interactions are similar to dating, she still feels like there's some kind of barrier between them, an invisible distance that can't be crossed even when they're physically close.</span></p></div>
