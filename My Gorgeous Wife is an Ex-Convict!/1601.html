        <h1>Chapter 1599</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Control your daughter! What does she mean by her mother's inheritance? We agreed that everything in the family would go to Lil Tian. Lil Tian is your flesh and blood. Your daughter will go to another family when she marries one day," the woman snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's enough. People will make fun of us if you go on!" The man comforted the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little girl turned around and put her hand on the little boy's face, which was slapped. Her face was full of distress as she asked, "Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did not see the little boy's expression but saw him shake his head, presumably telling the little girl he was not in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the siblings, Grace could not help but feel distressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">From the conversation earlier, it was obvious that the woman was the two children&rsquo;s stepmother. Her biological child was the chubby one called Lil Tian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The girl and boy must be the children the husband had with his ex-wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two seemed close. When the little boy was slapped by his stepmother, the little girl stood up for him and tried her best to protect him. When the stepmother wanted to slap the little girl, the little boy suddenly turned aggressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... the children were too young! They would probably suffer in a family like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One could tell by the way the little girl and the little boy were dressed. They did not seem to be children of the same family compared to the way Lil Tian was dressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy seemed about four or five years old, while the girl was about seven or eight years old. Children their age needed responsible guardians.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help but think of herself. She had a hard time when her mother died, and her father later married another woman. Fortunately, she had her grandmother to protect her. Her stepmother would also put on shows for others, so it was not too hard for her at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Not all stepmothers in the world were evil and there were many kind stepmothers, but this woman here was not a kind one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, why would she go to another family? Will I go to another family too?" Jasper asked with a puzzled look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace rubbed her daughter's little head. Before she could answer, Jason said, "No, never. You're my and your mommy's baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed said solemnly, "I won't get rid of you." His tone made him sound like an overbearing brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper smiled again but her smile disappeared soon after. "The little sister is so pitiful. Will she be thrown out? The brother too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"They won't," Grace said, "Don't you see the little sister protecting her little brother? He won't be kicked out of the house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, just like how Brother protects me!" said Jasper Reed. Her little face was relieved of worry, and she began to look around happily again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace could only sigh. Every family had their own set of problems. However, at least the brother and sister had each other to rely on.</p></div>
