        <h1>Chapter 3748</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, what did you say?!" Vanessa glared angrily, "Do you know who you're talking to?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you think you're noble? Only you can criticize others, but others can't criticize you?" Veronica retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am indeed more noble than you, so what?" Vanessa said, her eyes filled with not only anger but also disdain. In her eyes, people like Veronica were nothing but lowly dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was being kept by someone now, once this kind of thing was exposed, she would never be able to hold her head up again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would see how unlucky Veronica would be then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the first thing she had to do was-"Manager, where is the manager of your restaurant?" Vanessa suddenly grabbed a waiter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter went to find the manager, and after a moment, the manager walked over and asked, "Is there anything Miss Thompson needs?" After all, Vanessa was a regular here, and the manager knew her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you see, I paid for their table today. After all, my classmate usually does compensated dating and brought her gigolo here to eat. The price is a bit too much for her to bear, so as a classmate, I kindly helped her out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa deliberately raised her voice when speaking, obviously wanting everyone around to hear, and the group of girlfriends standing beside her even burst into mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Vanessa's words, the manager looked at Veronica's table and was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What...what is this woman talking about? Saying that the female companion brought by Mason from the Reed family is...doing compensated dating? And then saying that Mason is a gigolo?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh my god, if the Reed family really investigates, not only will this woman be in trouble, but even their restaurant will be implicated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, the manager's face turned pale, and he immediately said to the waiter beside him, "Call the security guard over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" The waiter hurriedly ran off, and Vanessa's face flashed with surprise before turning into a smug expression. The manager must be planning to kick Veronica and that pretty boy out of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People like Veronica dining here only lower the restaurant's standards!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the pretty boy, if he apologizes properly, Vanessa wouldn't mind spending some time with him. After all, his face is quite to her liking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what Vanessa didn't expect was that when several security guards arrived, the manager pointed directly at her and said, "Kick her and her companions out of the restaurant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Vanessa and her friends were shocked. "Manager, what are you saying? You want us to leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, this restaurant doesn't welcome you, and you will be permanently blacklisted." </span><span>The manager scolded the security guards and urged them to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards then said to Vanessa and her friends, "Ladies, please come with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not leaving. What can you do? Your restaurant has no right to refuse customers. And I will go to the Consumer Council to sue you. If you don't give me an explanation today, you won't even be able to keep your restaurant open!" Vanessa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you can try!" The manager said stubbornly, urging the security guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the longer they stayed, the more they would anger Mason.</span></p></div>
