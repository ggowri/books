        <h1>Chapter 2128</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said urgently, "Grace, do you really believe that this kid can save Lina and the baby?" After all, the kid was too young. How could a seven or eight-year-old boy save someone even specialists could not save?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Since the doctor has said that there&rsquo;s nothing else they can do to save Lina, we can only try everything in this moment of despair. Besides... the kid was right about the baby's gender before this. Maybe there's something special about him!" said Grace. She could only take a bet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace led the little boy to the delivery room, and Kyla followed. The two women entered the delivery room while the two men waited outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After entering the delivery room, Grace only saw Hadwin Stephenson sobbing and shouting Lina's name. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had passed out on the birthing bed with no color on her face. Her big bulging belly was not exuding life but death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctors and nurses in the ward saw the three people coming in and were trying to stop them when Grace said, "I'm Jason's wife, Grace. I'm also Lina's friend. Since you failed to save her, then I'll give my way a try!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's voice seemed to give Hadwin Stephenson some hope after losing it just now. "Do you really have a way to save Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's this child. He said he has a way to save them," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Him?" Hadwin Stephenson looked at the little boy in front of him with surprise. Could a child whose height only reached his waist save Lina? "Are you... kidding me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why don't we just let him try anyway?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the little boy beside Grace walked up to Lina, who was in a coma. He picked up an unused scalpel when no one noticed and cut his own hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah!" a nurse shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A doctor yelled, "What's the boy doing? Hurry... Hurry and get him out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't touch me!" the little boy shouted suddenly. There was a rare sense of authority in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While the doctors and nurses were stunned, the little boy raised his hand and moved his bleeding hand to Lina's mouth. One drop, two drops... The red blood dripped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina, who had fainted, gasped for air and opened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy said to Lina, "You have to deliver her no matter what you do, or both of you will die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina seemed to understand what the little boy said. Her face instantly turned red as her hands grasped the covers. It was as if she was trying to use her remaining strength to give birth to the baby in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctors and nurses, who had given up hope, gathered round and began to work on delivering the baby again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Kyla gaped at all this. Who knew... the boy's blood could give Lina the strength to deliver the baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson also quickly rushed to Lina with surprise and joy. It was as if hope had been injected into the despair he felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Finally, the baby was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the baby was purple and not breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Doctors and nurses rushed to rescue the baby. However, after one minute, two minutes... The baby was still not crying.</p></div>
