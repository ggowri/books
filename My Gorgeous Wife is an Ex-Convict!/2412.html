        <h1>Chapter 2410</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He called her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; with endless tenderness and longing. It sounded so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as if her heart filled with something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I love you." Her fingers gently unbuttoned his shirt...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian drove his car back to his residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kept recalling the scene of Jason pulling Grace into the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason could be with Grace so openly, but he could only look at her from afar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that once you made the wrong choice, everything that followed would be wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how hard he tried afterward, he could not catch up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was now paying for that mistake, and the price was his happiness for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked into the house, and a beautiful figure appeared in front of him. "Brian, you're back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the woman in front of him. She looked like a young Grace. He had met her in a nightclub. He heard that the woman was going to sell herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want a woman who looked like Grace to end up there, so he asked her to work as his secretary while he was abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he had the idea of using this woman as a substitute for Grace. However, after spending time with Grace today, he realized that a substitute was only a substitute. She could not replace Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Despite the resemblance, he could not treat her like Grace. He did not even have... the slightest bit of affection for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing in Deer City? Didn't I ask you to continue your studies abroad?" Brian asked indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just missed you so much that I came to see you," Whitney Cooper said sweetly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was worried that the crown prince of the entertainment industry would meet another beautiful woman and forget her when she was abroad. Hence, she went out of her way to come to Deer City in secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper knew she could stay with Brian as a private secretary because she resembled the woman he liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People who had been around the crown prince for a long time had warned her not to have any wishful thinking. They said the crown prince was only taking pity on her and told her not to have any funny ideas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They said, "Young Master Hart has never lacked women, but there&rsquo;s only one person he truly loved. Everyone else is just a substitute, including you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Substitute?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could Whitney Cooper be content to only be a substitute?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finally jumped out of the hell hole and became a stunning secretary by getting on Brian's good side. If Young Master Hart abandoned her, she would be beaten back to her old self again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must never go back to her old life of misery!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted Brian unable to leave her and transfer all his affection to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that Brian loved Grace, who was now the mistress of Reed group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although there was pitifully little information about that woman online, it was not non-existent. Besides that, she had also secretly bought some photos of Grace taken by the media. She learned Grace's style, from her hairstyle to her dressing.</p></div>
