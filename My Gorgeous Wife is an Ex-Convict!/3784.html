        <h1>Chapter 3782</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compensate? What can he compensate for?! He... he should go to jail. How could he ruin your happiness? You... you must not listen to that Reed family Mason's words and break up with the person you love for money! In this world, money isn't everything. You will regret it for money... for money..." The old Mrs. Cross's voice became more urgent, and in the end, she even picked up the thick and long knitting needle and hit Daniel hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was shocked and wanted to stop her, but was stopped by Daniel's voice, "Don't interfere. Just watch from the side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's body stiffened, only seeing the old Mrs. Cross hitting Daniel harder and Daniel taking the beating silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the old Mrs. Cross seemed tired from hitting and gasped for breath. She turned to Veronica and said, "Veronica, you must forgive Daniel... he... he is a good boy, unlike his father. He won't break up with you for money. You... you must believe </span><span>him and forgive him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mrs. Cross kept talking, and Veronica was at a loss. She knew that the old Mrs. Cross was not in her right mind now, and if she couldn't give her a satisfactory answer, she was afraid that the old Mrs. Cross would continue to be agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I understand. I will believe him and forgive him," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That... that's great," the old Mrs. Cross murmured, holding Daniel and Veronica's hands together and letting them shake hands. "Now I can rest assured..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the old Mrs. Cross fell asleep on the hospital bed, and Daniel carefully covered her with a blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this what you wanted to show me?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her mental illness was triggered when my father embezzled money after we broke up. Mason promised to give my family a large sum of money, but on the condition that I break up with you. I did it, and that night, Mason's men came to my house with cash," Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he thought of the scene back then, he felt extremely humiliated, and his life became a mess because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But later, although my father made up for the embezzled money, he was still fired. Since then, it has been difficult to find a stable job, and he could only do odd jobs. As for my mother, her mental problems began to appear and became more and more serious, and she had to be hospitalized for a long time. As for me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel sighed bitterly, "As for me, you can see what I've become. I've achieved nothing, and everything I wanted to do when I was in school has not been realized!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you think everything is thanks to Mason?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't I think that way? If he hadn't used money back then, even if my father really embezzled public funds, he might have been sentenced to prison, but at least my mother wouldn't have had a mental breakdown, and we wouldn't have broken up. Maybe we would still be together, and your father and stepmother might have helped us, and our lives would have gradually improved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you think my father and stepmother would help us?" Veronica suddenly felt that Daniel in front of her was becoming more and more unfamiliar.</span></p></div>
