        <h1>Chapter 3726</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-no, I don't." She said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then it's settled!" He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he left the room, Veronica was still in shock from what had happened today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Downstairs, Mason looked up at the lit window and placed his hand over his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If what she did to him tonight was a way for her to confirm her feelings towards him, then wasn't it the same for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her kisses and touches made his blood boil, and his skin felt like it was on fire. He almost couldn't control himself and wanted to pin her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had no control over his desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, his body's craving for her was so strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So even though his memory was hypnotized, his body still remembers... who he used to love the most?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>......</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica didn't sleep well all night. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw the ambiguous scene on the sofa. When she woke up in the morning, she had two panda eyes and went to school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she was already a junior, she had fewer classes, which gave her time to work outside of school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, why do you have such obvious dark circles? Is it because you're tired from work and didn't sleep well?" Shirley Woolery, Veronica's good friend from the same class, walked up to her and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, it's not because of work. I just... stayed up too late watching TV dramas last night." Veronica said, although she did indeed "watch" TV dramas last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, we only have two classes this morning. After class, do you want to go to the flea market to find some stuff?" Shirley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called flea market originally sold some second-hand furniture, but later developed into selling some scraps of fabric and some leftover clothes from factories. The sizes are not complete, and many of them are only one or two pieces, but they are cheap. A regular T-shirt may cost $4.3 to $6.3 in a normal store, but in the flea market, it's basically priced at $0.7 to $1.4.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Students like Veronica and Shirley, who don't have much money, like to go there to buy some clothes. Sometimes Veronica will also buy some scraps of fabric and make her own sleeve covers, aprons, and other small things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Veronica agreed, since she was working in the afternoon today, she had time in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After class, the two of them took the bus and arrived at the flea market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Veronica, this is the most familiar place in recent years. She comes here every few months to find things she needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she plans to choose some fabrics, make a table mat, and then make a few pillows. Although there are already two pillows at home, Mason often comes to her place now, so... it's better to have a few more pillows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the two of them finally bought what they needed. Shirley looked at the time, and it was almost noon. "Why don't we have lunch nearby and then go back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them found a restaurant nearby, ordered their food, and were about to find a table to sit down when a figure walked in from outside the shop. When that person's gaze met Veronica's, they suddenly froze, their face showing a complex mix of embarrassment, nervousness, and other emotions.</span></p></div>
