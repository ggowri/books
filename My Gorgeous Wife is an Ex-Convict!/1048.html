        <h1>Chapter 1047</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... Hehe. I heard that many celebrities will be attending tonight, so I asked Hadwin to bring me here." Lina laughed dryly. She was embarrassed to tell her that she had &lsquo;asked&rsquo; him by nibbling and kissing Hadwin Stephenson before he finally agreed after sharing one night of passion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Hadwin Stephenson made her make a pact before coming. She was not allowed to get too excited when she saw a male celebrity. She was not allowed to approach them for an autograph, and she was not allowed to ask them for a photo together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She reluctantly agreed, thinking it was good enough to see them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect to see her best friend here. What was more, she was with... Lina sized up Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a fan, she recognized Brian instantly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crown prince of the entertainment industry! The man behind so many top celebrities! One could say that as long as the crown prince wanted to make someone famous, even a pig could be famous! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, what are you doing here? You and this&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wanted to see someone, so I asked Mr. Hart to bring me here," Grace quickly explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Someone? Who is it?" Lina asked curiously. 'I remember Grace isn't much of a fangirl! She's not here to ask someone for an autograph, is she?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley Daniels and Martin Weiss," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina instantly knew it probably had something to do with Kyla Corbyn, so she took Grace aside and asked, "How's it going with Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley Daniels probably sent someone to cause trouble for Kyla again. Kyla can&rsquo;t do business as usual because of this. If Kyla can't have a stable income, it&rsquo;ll be bad for the custody case," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said angrily, "Paisley Daniels is so despicable! Why don't I talk to Hadwin and ask him to give Kyla a job?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's wait until I talk to Paisley Daniels and Martin Weiss. We'll do as you say if it doesn't work out," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they were done talking about Kyla Corbyn, Lina sized up her best friend. "Speaking of which, you're so beautiful today! You look just as good as those socialites!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's long, black hair was in an updo, but a few strands were hanging down her cheeks. With her delicate makeup, she looked elegant yet dreamily feminine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The gown she wore was graceful and elegant, making Lina amazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did Brian... prepare this for you?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's going on with you and Brian?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... it's a long story. I'll tell you about it next time," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Hadwin Stephenson was also sizing up Brian. He was surprised that Brian and Grace were attending the charity gala together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way Brian looked at Grace just now&hellip; As a man, he knew what it meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... Grace still has Jason&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly felt glad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, he fell in love with Lina, so he was not having much trouble. There would be so much trouble if Brian went against Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard the Hart Group made a lot of boy bands popular this year." Hadwin Stephenson casually found a topic to talk about. Of course, he heard it from Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only needed to look at the girl's video browsing history every once in a while to know what new popular boy band had emerged recently.</p></div>
