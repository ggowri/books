        <h1>Chapter 2964</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you want to become a lawyer?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because this way, I can help many innocent people seek justice. I want to become a good lawyer like my godmother," Nelson said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His godmother, of course, referred to Grace Cummins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at the child in front of her, who was half her height, and saw a resolute determination in his eyes, similar to Kyla's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, she felt that this person in front of her was no longer a child, but a fighter, someone who would tirelessly fight for their ideals!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was also the first time she had seen such a determined look in a child's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You will definitely become a good lawyer in the future," Valda said. "But now, let's go see the painting of the future great lawyer!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she patted Nelson's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Brian and Martin behind the three were silent. They weren't exactly close, but they had known each other for many years and had even accidentally met at a bar and had a drink together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Brian was the first to break the silence and asked, "Are you planning to stay in Emerald City for a long time? Or when are you going to take Kyla and the kids back to your city?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin pursed his lips and responded with a question, "What about you? Are you really able to forget about Grace while being with Valda?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't necessarily have to forget," Brian said. "My past with Grace was a part of my life that I don't want to forget. However, I now know what is important to me and I hope that my future won't be too dark. I want more laughter in my life, so I want to keep her close to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Valda can give him hope for the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Do you really think you can balance it well? Can you treat your feelings for Valda the same way you treat Grace?" said Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I will balance it well, Valda is the person I will spend my life with!" Therefore, in the future, he will definitely fall in love with Valda, he definitely will!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope you can really do that," said Martin. "But I used to think that even if you were to get married in this lifetime, you would probably only find someone who matches your family background, just to continue the family line. I never thought you would find a woman like Valda."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never expected it. Brian thought to himself that it was just a sudden impulse, but it turned into such a fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was finally God's mercy that sent Valda to his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I also thought that maybe you and Kyla had really broken up like that, but now, unexpectedly, you're back together," Brian replied with the same words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, we're together again." But how much of it is true love, and how much of it is just pretending?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin looked up and gazed at Kyla's back, lost in thought...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at the exhibition hall, Valda finally saw Nelson's painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the child's age, being able to draw such a picture truly surprised Valda. She thought that if Nelson didn't aspire to become a lawyer, he could have been a good artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So Valda praised Nelson again, complimenting him so much that he blushed.</p></div>
