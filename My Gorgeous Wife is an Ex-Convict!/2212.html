        <h1>Chapter 2210</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, it&rsquo;s best if you stop getting your blood drawn for a while. We recommend the average healthy person donate blood once every six months. You&rsquo;ve had your blood drawn twice in a short time. You need to wait six months before you can get your blood drawn again,&rdquo; the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Six months?' Martin Weiss smiled wrily. 'Six months won't do. Kyla's baby might be born in less than six months. There won't be enough blood when we need it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The blood bank did not have much bags of such rare blood types. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let&rsquo;s do it once a month, then,&rdquo; said Martin Weiss. It was only once a month for just a few months. He hoped to have enough blood in the blood bank before Kyla gave birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's too risky. If you do it once a month, it could kill you!" the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know my limits, and I'll hire a professional nutritionist to take care of my diet. It won't have any impact on my body. If the hospital is afraid of being held accountable, I can also sign a disclaimer with the hospital," said Martin Weiss as he got up slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt momentarily lightheaded even though he got up slowly. He also staggered forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, watch out!" The doctor immediately grabbed Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you." Martin Weiss stabilized himself. Moments later, his lightheadedness finally subsided. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, as a doctor, I'm still going to warn you that even though you desperately want to donate blood for your wife, she won't be happy if anything happens to you because of this. You might only leave her with more sadness and remorse. No matter what happens, you should cherish your life," the doctor said sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss smiled wrily. &lsquo;Will Kyla feel sad for me if anything happens to me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the one hand, he wanted him to mean something to her, but on the other hand, he did not want him to be upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He patted the doctor on the shoulder. "My life means nothing to me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back when he found out about everything and that he owed his life to her, he had been living only for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His life could belong to her at any time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla closed the windows at night, she once again saw Martin Weiss's car parked not far from the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated a little before putting on a coat. She walked out of the store and went to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss got down and looked at Kyla. Before she could speak, he already said, "I... I'm sorry. I know you don't want to see me, so I'll go home immediately. I... I won't bother you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he turned around to open the car door, only to feel lightheaded when he approached the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss staggered, and his body leaned to one side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost out of instinct, Kyla stepped forward to grab him.</p></div>
