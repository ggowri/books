        <h1>Chapter 1411</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he said this, the Daniels family's expression immediately changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels felt a chill up her spine and she could not help trembling. 'What... What does he mean by that? Could it be...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin... I... I don't know what you mean by that? How... How did I fool you? I... I don't understand!" Paisley Daniels pretended to look innocent, and her eyes were suddenly full of tears. She looked utterly pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Martin Weiss only found the way she pretended to be disgusting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You don't understand?" He suddenly chuckled. Then, he pulled out his phone and tapped twice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The phone immediately played the audio of the phone call between the bone marrow bank and Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The expressions of the Daniels family members instantly turned grim when Paisley Daniels's voice rang out. Paisley Daniels's face became even redder while beads of sweat broke out on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is this... the recording Grace was talking about the other day? Grace must have given Martin the recording!' Paisley Daniels's hatred for Grace deepened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Paisley Daniels, you're good. You're really good..." Martin Weiss slowly walked to the hospital bed. Those narrow deep eyes of his were staring at her coldly with intense anger in them. "I didn't think you'd manage to fool me for so many years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"This... This recording is fake. It's not real! That's not me speaking on that recording!" Paisley Daniels denied it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Not you?" Martin Weiss hit Paisley Daniels hard in the face with a stack of information in his hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I've checked with the doctor at the bone marrow bank who called you and compared your voiceprint with the voiceprint on this recording. It&rsquo;s the same voice! Paisley Daniels, what do you have to say now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Flustered, Paisley Daniels almost stammered, "There are records for those who donated their bone marrow. Look them up and you'll find out... if it's true or false..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before she could finish speaking, she saw someone walking into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels's eyes widened in disbelief as the man appeared in the ward. It was Shane Currey!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Shouldn't he have taken the money and gone abroad by now? Why is he here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels watched as Shane Currey walked up to Martin Weiss. He rubbed his hands and said with a face full of embarrassment, "Mr. Weiss, it was Paisley Daniels who asked me to fake it and alter her bone marrow donation record. But I didn't tell her that you were the person she refused to donate to. She rummaged through the documents I brought back from the hospital and found out herself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As Shane Currey confessed, he also dissociated himself from the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Shane Currey, you're slandering me!" Paisley Daniels panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Shane Currey said, "Slander? I'm telling the truth! Didn't you give me 50 million to shut me up? However, I didn't expect you to be so cruel, Paisley Daniels. You were pregnant with my baby but you devised all that to miscarry it on purpose!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels rushed out of the hospital bed and jumped at Shane Currey, trying to stop him from saying any more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her feet had just touched the ground and before she could take a step, she was stopped by the bodyguards who came in with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Daniels and Mrs. Daniels tried to step forward, but they were separately stopped by Martin Weiss's bodyguards as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The three members of the Daniels family could only look at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels said desperately, "Martin, it's not like that. Don't listen to Shane Currey's nonsense. He set me up. He... got me drunk on purpose and framed me! Yes, Grace must have instructed him to do so. Just because Kyla Corbyn was imprisoned for causing my miscarriage back then, Grace is setting me up to help Kyla Corbyn!"</p></div>
