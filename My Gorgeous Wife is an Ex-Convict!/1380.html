        <h1>Chapter 1379</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, having loved someone so deeply only to break up like this in the end still made her heart hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, what was more important than her pain and sorrow was that she had friends and family. She did not want them to worry about her. She must cheer up to deserve their love and concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace... I'll hide Hadwin Stephenson in the bottom of my heart... I'll gradually forget him and this relationship. I won't hate or resent him... After all, there was no bad blood between him and me when we broke up. We just... don't share the same values," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt her nose becoming sore. Lina was stronger than she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina deserved a better man in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, Kyla Corbyn also visited Lina and was shocked to learn that Lina and Hadwin Stephenson had broken up. However, Kyla Corbyn felt a bit relieved after seeing Lina's open-minded attitude toward the break-up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was amazing that Lina was able to pull herself together after suffering such a heartbreak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina chatted for a while before getting sleepy again. She fell into a deep sleep. Kyla Corbyn said with a sigh, "Lina is really strong. She's probably sad but got over it so quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yeah. Lina may seem jolly and simple-minded all the time, but she's independent and big-hearted. She said she can get over Hadwin Stephenson after a good cry, but... is it that easy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People who had been in a relationship before understood how hard it was to let go of someone you once loved deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if it's not easy, you'll eventually make it. You can only start a new life after getting over it," murmured Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head to look at Kyla Corbyn. "Kyla, have you gotten over it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked up and smiled faintly. "Me? I've gotten over it. I've completely gotten over it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll soon have the evidence of your bone marrow donation to Martin Weiss, and Martin Weiss will know that you're the one who saved him. He's unlikely to refuse to donate you his liver," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn shook her head. "He'll refuse even more. Grace, he told me not to die in front of him. He won't save me, and I don't want to be naive again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Things had become clear to her in the amusement park. She knew now how much the man loathed and hated her, and she also knew getting over him had been the right choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was easy to say that you did not love someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, until now, she had never really done it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Kyla..." Grace tried to persuade again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn interrupted, "Grace, I'm now soberer than ever. I don't expect anything from Martin Weiss. I just hope you and Jason won't turn out like Martin Weiss and me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. Even though Kyla did not care about it, she still wanted to get justice for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I may not get to see your three babies when they're born, but I'll prepare gifts for them. I hope you&rsquo;ll like them," Kyla Corbyn smiled and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes reddened. "Kyla, don't you want to live? You still have Mrs. Corbyn and Nelson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are a lot of things you can't achieve just by wanting them." Kyla Corbyn sighed gently. "If I could, I would wish that I had never met Martin Weiss and got into a dispute with him. But on second thought, there would be no Nelson without him."</p></div>
