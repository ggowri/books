        <h1>Chapter 2426</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll apply the ointment to the wounds on my body myself," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you can't do it if they're on your back," she said. Then as if recalling something, she said quickly, "Well, actually... if Nelson is the one who&rsquo;s hurt, I&rsquo;d tell him to take off his shirt so I could apply the ointment for him too. You and Nelson are the same to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said it to avoid feelings of awkwardness, but the atmosphere got a little weird after she said it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He peered at her. "What's the matter? Do you think I'm the same as Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh... sort of." At least... they were both males.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss took off his bathrobe and exposed his upper body, "Really? Are we really similar?" He could not explain why he cared so much about what she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he did not want him and their son to hold the same positions in her heart. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she did not think of him as her husband at all! Did she not feel anything even if she saw him entirely naked?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla focused on the wounds on Martin Weiss's body. They were not serious, but there were many wounds on his body. One could tell that he must have gotten into quite a fierce fight outside today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately began applying the ointment for him. When she was done with his back, she went straight to the bruises on his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost unconsciously, her head lay close to his chest as she carefully applied the ointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stiffened instantly, only smelling her scent at the tip of his nose. It made him scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, scared!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if something he could not control would happen if this went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I've applied the ointment for you, but you need to apply it to your wounds twice a day. When you get up tomorrow morning, I'll give you..." said Kyla. Then, she looked up and found that Martin Weiss's face was pale. She froze and hurriedly said, "What's wrong? Was I too forceful when applying the ointment just now and ended up hurting you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only looked at Kyla in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got even more worried when he did not speak. She raised her hand to reach for his face, but he grabbed her wrist. "What do you mean by this? Are you concerned about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "What's wrong with me worrying about you? You... You said you want us to act like a normal married couple for a year."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I said that, but... the look of concern on your face will make me think you've fallen for me. Kyla, do you have to overdo your acting?" His voice rang out coldly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze. "Do you think I'm... acting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you? Are you telling me you've really fallen for me?" he asked in reply as if he was amused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A bitter feeling surged within her. She had never acted in front of him. Could she tell him she was truly in love with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was the point of telling him now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she had already decided to bury her feelings for him in her heart forever and never tell him why she had decided to separate from him!</p></div>
