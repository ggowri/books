        <h1>Chapter 1246</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a time when she could sleep with the lights off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she reverted to having to sleep with the lights on after breaking up with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace closed her eyes and silently counted the sheeps in her mind, hoping she could fall asleep soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she failed to fall asleep no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially... when there was another person beside her. Even though her eyes were closed, she seemed to feel his breath in her nose, and... she would end up touching his body if she moved in the slightest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bed was huge, but she seemed to touch his body so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time she had counted 1,000 sheeps, Grace still had not fallen asleep so she opened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was now lying on her side, a handsome face immediately intruded her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were closed, and his long fan-like lashes cast shadows on his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His high nose bridge, angular face, and sexy thin lips were a pleasure to look at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was less oppressive to see him asleep than it was to see him with his eyes open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the high and mighty Master Reed of Emerald City. He was now lying beside her, and he had become her husband, which was something she would not have thought of a year ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will we have another argument about whether to have a pregnancy reduction at the hospital tomorrow?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it, feeling a little worried. Suddenly, her gaze rested on his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the front of his night robe was somewhat open, she could see a grotesque scar on his chest near his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the scar had faded a lot over the years, she could still imagine how terrifying it had been. She knew it was his mother who had caused that wound!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He... must have been in a lot of pain!' Grace thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she felt a throb of pain in her hand, and she came to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She realized her hand was about to touch the scar on his chest, but he had grabbed her hand before she could touch it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her with a half-smile and his deep peach-blossom eyes. "What's the matter? Do you want me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shuddered as her face blushed, and she immediately denied it. "No, I... I was just..." 'Just what? Just can't help it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not even know how to explain it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know what you just did?&rdquo; He sneered. &ldquo;If you don't want me, don't do things that will mislead me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loosened his hand and closed his eyes again after she said, "Got it." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's cheeks were red. As she looked at her free hand, she hastily tucked her hand back under the covers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Oh my God! What came over me just now? Did I want to... touch him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She closed her eyes again and calmed herself down.</p></div>
