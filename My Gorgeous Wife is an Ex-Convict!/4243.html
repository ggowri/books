        <h1>Chapter 4241 Don't Let Him Be Greedy Again</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may be physically disabled, but it doesn't mean I can't do anything. I still have my other hand, my two feet, and a functioning brain. I can do many things to support myself," Kit said. "Besides, I don't plan on living a luxurious life, so I don't need to rely on the Stephenson family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to lose even the last bit of dignity in front of her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having the Stephenson family as a support may be a dream come true for many, but for him, it might only bring pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's gaze fell on Kit's disabled right hand again. "So, have you thought about what kind of work you want to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I plan to start by composing some songs. I've always been interested in that. It's just that I was too busy with work before and never had the chance to focus on it," Kit replied. "Now, I finally have the time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eugenia told me about some of our past and showed me some posters and autographed photos you gave me. It seems like I really liked you back then, but that was just..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, it was just the admiration of a fan for an idol," Kit sighed, feeling helpless. "How are you and Chandler doing now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're doing fine," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced a bitter smile and self-mockingly said, "Of course, you two were deeply in love. Even if you lost your memory, I temporarily deceived you with lies, but people who love each other will eventually find their way back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did they really love each other once? Even if memories were forgotten, would they still love each other?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It would have been nice if you hadn't lied to me back then," Tina murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit remained silent, not answering her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deceiving her was his biggest lie in life, and he regretted it. It was because of that final car accident. If he hadn't deceived her, she wouldn't have been hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, he missed the times when he deceived her and the moments they spent together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those moments were the most precious memories of his life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something you came to see me for today?" Kit finally asked after a long pause.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just wanted to come and see how you're doing and thank you for saving me. So, if you have any difficulties and need my help, I'll be there," Tina said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit's eyelashes trembled, and his lips quivered slightly. In the end, all he managed to say was, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you need me to find a better doctor for your hand to have further treatment?" Tina asked, considering the abilities of the Stephenson family to provide him with better medical care.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not necessary. The doctor who is currently treating me is an expert with extensive experience. I'm making good progress with my rehabilitation under his care," Kit replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then," Tina said, intending to turn and leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, Kit's left hand grabbed her wrist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something else?" Tina turned to look at Kit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit's hand trembled, and with some difficulty, he let go of her fingers. He had only grabbed her wrist instinctively when he saw her about to leave. He was afraid of her walking away like that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was supposed to leave, wasn't she?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never belonged to him in the first place!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing. I just hope Miss Stephenson won't come to see me anymore," Kit said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because if she did, she would only see more of his shameful side, and it would make his once-dead heart greedy again.</span></p></div>
