        <h1>Chapter 2923</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, it seems that Brian Hart has been treating you well..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Regardless of whether The Schuman family is involved or not, Brian and I have already broken up," Valda Theller replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, okay, you're single now. How about we go to a bar tonight and have some fun? Who knows, maybe you'll meet the man of your destiny!" Camille Strickland suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A bar? Sure, let's go to a bar tonight," Valda Theller agreed. After all, she wanted to relax and going to a bar with her friend seemed like a good idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That night, the two of them went to a well-known bar in tMason Swansonty. Valda Theller only ordered a low-alcohol cocktail, as she knew that women could easily get into trouble if they got drunk in a bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's going to be a band performing later, it's supposed to be really good. I heard that a lot of women come here just to see those handsome band members," Camille Strickland said excitedly. "I wonder what they look like. I read online that they're quite good-looking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you wanted to come to the bar with me to relax, not to see handsome boys!" Valda Theller suddenly realized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland laughed awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, when the band took the stage, the bar erupted in thunderous applause. Valda Theller felt like her ears were going to burst. The five men on stage played instruments, sang, and moved their bodies in a very energetic way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And these men were also quite good-looking, which was definitely a plus for women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But for some reason, Valda Theller couldn't get excited about these handsome boys that her friend was so excited about. All she could think of was Brian Hart's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she too old to be a fan of handsome boys? Or was it because she loved Brian Hart too much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled bitterly, finished her cocktail, and said to her friend, "I'm going to the restroom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, hurry back. If you take too long, their performance might be over," Camille Strickland reminded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller walked out of the hall and into the restroom, where she finally felt some relief from the noise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she washed her face in the restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had come here to relax, but she didn't feel relaxed at all, not even when she saw those handsome boys on stage!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After standing at the restroom door for a while, Valda Theller finally walked back to her seat in the noisy bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But when she got back to her seat, she found that her friend was not there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Where did Camille go? Valda Theller looked around, but she couldn't see her friend anywhere in the dimly lit bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did Camille also go to the restroom?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller sent a text message to her friend, but after a while, she didn't receive any reply.</p></div>
