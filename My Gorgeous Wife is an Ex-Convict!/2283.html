        <h1>Chapter 2281</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop talking. The doctor told you not to talk so much," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;re not pushing me away. Is it because you can't bear to see me in pain?" He continued to talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I just think you saved my life, so it doesn't matter... if you want to hug me like this for a while," she stammered slightly. His scent enveloped her, making her flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? It doesn't matter&hellip; whether you&rsquo;re grateful, compassionate, or sympathetic. At least... I hold some kind of place in your heart." Instead of her ignoring him even if he stood in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having her ignoring him felt awful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, what are you trying to say?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, you said the words 'my husband' to Neal Reid just now. I... I'm just asking if there's a chance that I can make our marriage more than just a formality. Can I... be your real husband?" he asked, his voice hoarse with a hint of nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he had summoned all his courage to ask this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent. For a moment, she had no idea how to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had been before, she would have said without hesitation that it was impossible and that it would be best if they had nothing to do with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she hesitated. Her previous words of rejection seemed stuck in her throat, and she could not utter them all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her silence made him seem happy. "Kyla, I matter to you, don't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She trembled. 'Does he matter to me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to matter so much to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, he became the pain of her life, and she tried to drive him out of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he seemed to have taken root in her heart again, little by little...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... can I be with him again? Is there any chance of anything happening between us?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." She opened her mouth, but her thoughts were in a whirl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "You don't need to answer me right now. You can think about it. Let me know after you make up your mind. I&rsquo;ll respect whatever decision you make in the end. At least, you didn't reject me right away, which is good enough for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Kyla lay in her hospital bed but had trouble falling asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Can I get together with Martin Weiss again? Can we become a real married couple and form a complete family?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Something that she had thought would never be possible was now up to her to decide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would her choice lead her into the abyss, or could she live a happy life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla got up, put on a coat, and went to the next ward. When she pushed the door open, the caretaker keeping watch whispered, "Mr. Weiss has fallen asleep after taking his medicine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll just watch him for a while. I won't wake him up," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The caretaker quietly withdrew from the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla went to the bedside and quietly watched the sleeping Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, she raised her hand and gently caressed his bandage-bound neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had cut his neck with a dagger without hesitation at the time. The scene would probably be branded in her mind for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she wanted to do at that time was to get the dagger in his hand. Her heart kept contracting. She was afraid he would just collapse and disappear from her world forever.</p></div>
