        <h1>Chapter 4095</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did something happen between him and the servant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, she can't sleep now and decides to go to Chandler's room to ask him about it. It should be okay, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina makes an excuse to go to Chandler's room in the middle of the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler's room is a distance away from her guest room, but luckily Tina had already memorized the route beforehand, so there weren't any obstacles for her to go there alone at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Hunter family at night is even colder than during the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And because it's nighttime, she didn't see any servants coming or going on her way here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The excessive silence makes her feel a bit scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, in the silent air, a hoarse shout suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mixed in with the wind, faintly, it even made Tina wonder if she had misheard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, she heard this kind of shout again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if suppressing deep pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's not an illusion!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone is really making a painful shout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even this sound gave her a strange feeling of familiarity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina's heart suddenly beat violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if instinctively sensing that something was about to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her footsteps suddenly became heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her sixth sense told her to quickly return to her room, pretending she knew nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But reason made her step forward, step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least, she wanted to know what had happened, what was this sound all about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was this sound really made by Chandler?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What she finally arrived at was the church she had accidentally broken into earlier today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina stood outside the partially open door, looking in at the lit room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The heavy breathing accompanied by suppressed pain became increasingly apparent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you had married that girl from the Stephenson family earlier, you wouldn't have to endure this pain now!" Mr. Hunter's voice came through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina shuddered. What did he mean? What pain was Chandler enduring?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...hope Tina can think clearly...about whether or not she wants to be with me..." Chandler's voice came through, but it was hoarse and strained compared to his usual voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed like speaking was an extremely difficult task for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want her to think clearly, then why haven't you told her anything?" Mr. Hunter's voice came through again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then there was silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All Tina could hear was the heavy, strained breathing and the muffled groans of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cautiously looked through the crack in the door to see inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the light, Mr. Hunter sat on an old mahogany chair, while Chandler lay on the ground in a disheveled state. His shoulders trembled constantly, and his fingers clawed at the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he was facing away, she couldn't see his expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had never seen him in such a disheveled state before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you afraid she'll change her mind? Afraid that if she or the Stephenson family find out that you only saw her as a baby-making machine, they'll do anything to annul the marriage? Afraid that if she finds out what your true intentions were when you first approached her, she'll despise you?" Mr. Hunter's voice continued.</p></div>
