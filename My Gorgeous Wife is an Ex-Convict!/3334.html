        <h1>Chapter 3332</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Valda took Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Harley, that's a nice name," said Hadwin. "I heard Valda had a smooth delivery this time. Among the few of us, your wife had the smoothest delivery, didn't she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it smooth? Brian imagined the scene of Valda giving birth and broke out in a cold sweat for the rest of his life. At that moment, he truly understood what it meant to be powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how much money or power one has, it cannot replace the suffering of losing the person they love the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian murmured, 'I feel like giving birth is really painful for women.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, but there's no way to replace it," Hadwin said with a heavy heart. "It's just that it hurts so much, and yet some people still want to have a second child. With so many children, what's the point?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the man with the most children present, Jason listened and smiled, "I think it's great, more children bring more blessings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so? You seem to do well when competing for attention with your children at home," pointed out Hadwin without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Okay, favoritism is indeed a problem. Even Jason couldn't find the words to say for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Grace and Lina brought the baby out, and Jason and Hadwin finally saw the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come and take a look, the child is so cute!" Lina said, "So adorable! I really want to have one myself just by looking at it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin gave Lina a look, "Don't even think about it. If you have another one, you'll be an elderly mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina was speechless, "I'm just thinking about it, I don't really want to have one." She also knew that she was getting older now, and having a child was not that easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason looked at the baby, who was chubby and strong. Compared to his own daughter when she was born, the baby looked much better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of his own daughter being born prematurely, Jason's eyes dimmed. His daughter had stayed in an incubator for a long time before slowly recovering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, even so, her physical condition was still weaker than that of ordinary children, and she was more prone to illness. Even a small cold was more likely to develop into pneumonia than other children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling Jason's change of mood at the moment, Grace raised her hand and gently pulled her husband's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason turned his head and met Grace's caring gaze. He smiled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After being married for many years, even if they don't say anything, they understand each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After Valda," Jason said after a moment, looking at the newborn Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you figure that out?" Grace asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With more children, you naturally start to see the resemblance," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Grace suddenly didn't know what to say. Why didn't she see it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But since the baby's eyes aren't open, it's unclear whose eyes they resemble," Jason added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's face lit up when he heard that the baby looked like Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Jason and the others left, Brian turned to Valda and said, "Jason said the baby looks like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Like me?" Valda was a little surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, he said the baby's bone structure looks more like yours," Brian said. "We just don't know whose eyes the baby has. It would be great if they looked like yours too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda chuckled, "Don't you think it would be a shame if your beautiful eyes didn't get passed down to your children?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But me, I prefer looking into your eyes," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt a wave of sweetness in her heart. Although she thought her eyes were just ordinary, well... this is probably what they mean by "beauty is in the eye of the beholder".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If everyone was like me, then where would your genetic traits be displayed?" Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Blood type, the child's blood type, is the same as mine," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda chuckled and then lowered her head, looking at the little baby in her arms. "I hope our Harley can open his eyes soon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She really wants to see what the baby looks like with its eyes open, and she also wants the baby to see her as its mommy as soon as possible.</p></div>
