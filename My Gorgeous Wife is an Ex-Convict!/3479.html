        <h1>Chapter 3477</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica led Jasper to the living room and poured him a glass of water. She also brought out some snacks to offer him as hospitality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Jasper did not eat or drink anything. He simply said, "Veronica, you don't need to bring out any food. I came here today just to figure out what happened between you and my friend Mason. If he did something to make you angry, please don't blame him. Can you forgive him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's body stiffened slightly, and she hesitated before asking, "Did he... ask you to come?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper shook his head and said, "You know what kind of person Mason is. How could he possibly ask someone else to be a mediator? I noticed that Mason has been staying at home and not going to school these days. He's been silent all day long, and when I try to ask him, I can't seem to get anything out of him. That's why I came to ask you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We... had some disagreements," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of argument is it that you can't forgive him?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica suddenly remembered the scene where Mason had forcibly kissed her in the private room. Her body stiffened even more, and her face showed a hint of discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper noticed the situation and didn't ask further. He simply advised, "Veronica, don't be angry with Mason. Sometimes he can be very straightforward and doesn't know how to beat around the bush. Maybe he does things or says things based on his own preferences and mood. However, one thing that hasn't changed is that you are the most important person to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica bit her lip slightly and said, "You are all related to him by blood, so you are also very important to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper said, "Actually, our whole family knows how important you are to my brother Mason. Sometimes I think that even the weight of our entire family in his heart cannot compare to your weight. Sometimes I even envy how good your relationship is with Mason. Even when I want to get close to Mason, I sometimes feel like I can't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like having someone standing right in front of you, talking to you, but it feels like there's a million miles between you two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, I envy you but I am not jealous of you. When we were young and our whole family was not around Mason, it was you, Sister Veronica, who protected him. So I am very grateful to you. No matter what conflicts you and Mason have, you have resolved them little by little, right? Mason is silent all day now, and I can tell that he is actually very uncomfortable!" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uncomfortable?" Veronica was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, we're triplets, and to put it in a mystical way, we have a connection! I can feel that Mason has been really sad lately, I swear!" Jasper said, raising three fingers in a gesture of sincerity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt a heavy pressure on her chest, causing a slight discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Veronica's phone suddenly rang. She picked it up and saw that it was Lionel calling from his number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She answered the phone and heard Lionel's slightly drunken voice on the other end, "Hey sis, do you want to come over and hang out with me? I've made some new friends and I promise that all your troubles will disappear once you're here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica frowned, "Where exactly are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel gave an address, but Veronica's frown deepened. It was the name of a famous nightclub in Emerald City, and Lionel was so young. She couldn't believe he was hanging out in a place like that.</p></div>
