        <h1>Chapter 606</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, she opened her mouth and said, "If you think that only by doing it here can I prove how much I love you, then... So be it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was willing to do things she did not want to do for him. It did not matter even if someone caught them red-handed and placed them in an extremely embarrassing situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to soothe his vulnerability right now. She wanted to take good care of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared blankly at the person in front of him. Her voice was so familiar, yet it was unfamiliar to his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What&rsquo;s she talking about? She said she was willing.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if her body was clearly shaking, even if she was clearly in fear, for his sake... She was willing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if something was running through his heart, making him feel sour and bitter, but... It soothed all his restlessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even his cold body seemed to be warming up...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was Grace, the woman he loved...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long while, Jason slowly let out a sigh and took the jacket, which was thrown aside, to cover Grace's body. He covered her exposed skin that was revealed from the torn dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry... I was too impulsive just now," he muttered, reaching out his arm to hug her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He almost had his way with her in the car just now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had it not been for her voice pulling back his sanity, perhaps he might have done something to hurt her. His hands tightened a little at the thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace leaned into Jason's arms, and the shaking gradually stopped. This was the Jason she was familiar with. Was he... All right now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... Was it Brian?" Grace hesitated before saying, "He mistook me for someone else. I'm not the one he's looking for. You shouldn't mind him. Besides, I told you, even if I&rsquo;m the one he&rsquo;s looking for, I won't have anything to do with him. The one I love is you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm the one you love," muttered Jason. His eyes rested on her wrists which were still tied by his tie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His slender fingers gently unfastened the restraints around her wrists. Then, he saw the bruises on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hurt you," he muttered with a rare touch of guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not so bad. It doesn't hurt that much," Grace said casually, not wanting him to feel bad about it. "How about you? Do you feel any better?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I feel much better," he replied, letting her put on his suit jacket. Then, he helped to button up the buttons one by one and fixed her tangled hair before restarting the car. They headed down the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car arrived at the entrance of the Reed Residence, Grace unfastened her seatbelt and was about to get out when Jason said, "Hold on, I'll carry you in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I can walk," said Grace. After all, she was not hurt except for a couple of bruises on her wrists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your dress is badly torn. Do you really think it's all right for you to walk in like this?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately blushed, then&hellip; She kept quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked to the front passenger seat of the car, stooped down, and gingerly picked Grace up before walking into the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servants they passed by on their way looked sideways at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only were Grace's face and neck red, but she pretty much buried her head in Jason's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They probably thought differently when they saw her wearing his suit jacket. Of course... Uh, the truth did seem a little &lsquo;different&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they were on the second floor and back in her room, Jason finally put Grace down before taking out a change of clothes from her wardrobe.</p></div>
