        <h1>Chapter 393</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss was so intense that it almost choked her. When it was over, Grace felt a little weak. Half of her body was being propped by his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'd better not even think about breaking up," muttered Jason with endless persistence in his bright eyes. "Now that you've promised to date me, I'm the only person you can date from now on! I, too, will only date you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was silky and lovely. It was like an invisible net grabbing her tightly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace finally finished her lunch in Jason's office, she looked at the time, hurriedly cleaned up, and left the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got out, she met Terrence who was polite and somewhat reverent as he said, "Are you leaving, Miss Cummins?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Be careful on your way back," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace got into the elevator, a mid-level executive beside Terrence could not help but ask, "Who... is she, Terrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the woman was dressed in cheap clothes and did not look like someone from the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Young Master Reed's private secretary was treating the woman so reverently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, there were very few people in the company whom Terrence would treat respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's..." Terrence somewhat thoughtfully said, "someone we cannot mess with."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the one Young Master Reed treasured! If anyone messed with her, they would probably be doomed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went back to the restaurant and continued with her deliveries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason would always order a lot of food. Then, he would ask her to deliver them to Reed Group and ask her to stay for lunch. She felt guilty for doing this. It was as if she was doing something personal at work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not refuse Jason's orders. After all, the food he ordered every day was a good income for the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm. Where's Kyla? She's not back yet?" Grace finally realized that Kyla Corbyn was not in the restaurant after delivering a few more orders. It had been Mrs. Corbyn taking care of the cash register.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson has a cold. Qianyun took him to the community health center to get some medicine," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, Kyla Corbyn came back to the restaurant with Nelson on her back. The boy was heavily asleep on his mother's back. Grace immediately carried the little one down and asked, "Is Nelson okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just the common cold, not a big problem," said Kyla Corbyn as she forced out a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the exhaustion on her face and could not help saying, "You look tired. Do you want to go and have a rest? The restaurant is empty now anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn shook her head. "I'm alright. I'm just worried about Nelson. I'm scared that he doesn't know how to express his discomfort. After all, some things are harder to express through sign language than speaking. Plus, he's still young and does not know much sign language. I just hope he doesn't get sick again before he gets a cochlear implant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Nelson who was fast asleep. "Will he get a cochlear implant in two months?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." With that, Kyla Corbyn finally smiled a little. "Although it's a cheaper model, he can hear things and learn to speak after having the implant. I'll get him a better one when I get rich in the future. This is pretty much what the rest of my life will be, but I do hope that he can live a good life."</p></div>
