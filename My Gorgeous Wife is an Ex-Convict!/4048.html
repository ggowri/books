        <h1>Chapter 4046</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And who is this..." Mr. Ingram's gaze turned to Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's my fianc&eacute;e, Tina." Chandler introduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So this is Miss Stephenson!" Mr. Ingram seemed to know about Chandler's engagement to the Stephenson family, but had never met Tina before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing Chandler's introduction, he finally felt like he was meeting her in person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, Uncle Ingram. You can call me Tina," Tina greeted him gracefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Ingram immediately responded with a smile, "I didn't expect Tina to be a fan of our Kit. If you ever want tickets to Kit's concert, just ask."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina's eyes lit up at the mention of Kit, but Kit's eyelashes trembled slightly and his eyes drooped, hiding the disgust that flashed across them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We have the autograph, let's go," Chandler said to Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh," Tina replied, but before leaving, she didn't forget to say to Kit, "Kit, I will continue to support you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Chandler and Tina left, Kit no longer concealed the disgust in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't expect the Stephenson family's daughter to be your fan," Mr. Ingram looked at his son with satisfaction. "I heard Hadwin dotes on his daughter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's just a fangirl," Kit said, ignoring her completely if it weren't for the occasion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's just a little girl. It's natural to get excited when she sees her idol," Mr. Ingram patted his son's shoulder. "If you have the chance, you can get closer to this little girl. If she speaks well of our company, we might be able to collaborate with the Stephenson family in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand," Kit said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, building a good relationship with this little girl was not difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since he was young, he knew how to use his appearance to achieve his goals faster, and as he grew older, he became more skilled at it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're really my good son," Mr. Ingram said with a smile. "But while you're building a good relationship with that girl, remember not to get too close. After all, she's Chandler's fianc&eacute;e, and Hunter is someone we can't afford to offend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hunter from the Crypt families is not well-known. He has always been behind the scenes and rarely appears in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in recent years, Chandler has gradually stepped into the limelight and attended many events. This has led some people to speculate whether Hunter intends to move from behind the scenes to the forefront.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the industries that Chandler manages for Hunter in public are only a part of Hunter's true wealth, and no one knows exactly how much it is.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's why Mr. Ingram reminded his son not to get involved with Chandler because of Tina's relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit sneered. He has no interest in Tina, so he naturally won't get involved with Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... Chandler's image flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reserved and unfathomable! This was his first impression of Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If even his father said not to mess with him, then Chandler must be extraordinary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why would such a man choose a shallow woman like Tina as his fianc&eacute;e?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it because of Tina's background?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that having a good birth is really better than anything else.</p></div>
