        <h1>Chapter 478</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason bent over slightly and whispered in Grace's ear, "No?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Grace was embarrassed. How could she answer such a question?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her grandmother sighed, took her hand, and said, "You must hurry up or I might not be able to attend your wedding reception."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked when her grandmother held her hand in such a way that she realized it was thinner than before. Grace could clearly feel the bones of her grandmother&rsquo;s hand by how the latter had her hand around hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if only a thin piece of skin was wrapped around her bones, and her hand had no flesh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma&hellip; was older than she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a pang of bitterness in her heart, and her face naturally showed her sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, why are you sad again?" Grandma patted Grace on the back of her hand and said, "I'm relieved to see that you're doing well and that someone can take care of you. Finally, I can justify myself when I see your mother down there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you say that, Grandma!" Grace said hurriedly. One could say that Grace was superstitious, but she was really afraid her grandmother would pass on. The only person left who cared about her as someone of the same family was her Grandma! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. All right. I won't say it anymore. I'll live a few more years to see you get married. I'd better see you have a baby as well," Grandma said with a chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace relaxed a little and brought out the pastries that she had bought for her grandmother to taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three of them talked a bit more, and Grandma asked Jason about his family. Grandma then found out that Jason had only one grandfather left, had lost his father, and had been abandoned by his mother when he was very young. Hence, she could not help but show him sympathy with the look in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You and Grace have gone through similar things. She lost her mother as well, so she was stuck with me for quite some time," said Grandma. Then, as if something had suddenly occurred to her, she said, "Here, I have a picture of Grace when she was still a kid. Do you want to take a look?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." Jason did not refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little embarrassed. "Grandma!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go and fetch me the photo album." Grandma directed Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, under Jason and her grandmother&rsquo;s watchful eyes, Grace had no choice but to take the old photo album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma then got Jason to look at the photos one by one. Each time she flipped over to a photo of Grace, she would tell Jason what had happened and the story behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grandma was old, her memory was very good. She remembered very clearly many things and even the minor details of certain incidents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes narrowed as the album turned to a certain page. "This is?" He asked while staring at the photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, this is Grace's cousin, my third daughter's daughter," replied Grandma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then explained, "It's my cousin who was in the living room just now, Stella Lindsay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was her. Jason wore a smirk on her face as she looked at the person in the photo. "You looked exactly like her when she was a child. However, both of you look very different now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, there was a time when we looked alike. Back in those days, my cousin and I were often mistaken for one another. However, as we grew older, our features became more and more distinct," said Grace.</p></div>
