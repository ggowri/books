        <h1>Chapter 4335 Neglected People</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't think much! "She said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a beautiful young woman in a red dress walked forward and said to Lornell, "Lornell, long time no see, how have you been lately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's still the same as before, "Lornell replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley watched as she knew this woman, a relative of the Quentin family named Ursula, who had also played with them since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, it's basically Ursula and Lornell playing, and as for her, Ursula wouldn't pay much attention to her unless she was necessary, just treating her like air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like at this moment, she and Lornell were standing together, but Ursula only greeted Lornell without saying hello, as if she hadn't seen her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Lornell didn't say anything, as if he had become accustomed to this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't it just a habit? Harley smiled wryly and then said lightly, "Take your time talking, I'll go eat something first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she didn't look at their reactions either, so she walked away directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell looked at Harley's back and unconsciously frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ursula whispered, "Lornell, your fianc&eacute;e seems to be getting impolite. She doesn't even say hello to me, but it's not surprising. Who made her the princess of the Hart family? Of course, she's extraordinary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell turned his head and looked at Ursula with a smirk on his face. "Didn't you also say hello to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ursula said awkwardly, "I... I just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you don't need to explain anything to me, "Lornell said lightly as if it was just an insignificant matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ursula breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Lornell still doesn't care about Harley!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Harley holds the name of his fianc&eacute;e, it has been so many years and Lornell's attitude towards Harley has not changed much, so what tied the two together is just a marriage agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she and Lornell were more intimate and had a better time, it was only because Harley was the daughter of the Hart family that</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Ursula's heart was filled with reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, someone else came to Lornell's side to say hello, while Ursula, like Lornell's fianc&eacute;e, followed Lornell's side and talked to those who came to say hello.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stood not far away, watching the scene expressionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had actually seen too much of this situation. At first, there were various pains in her heart, but later on, she gradually became numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even her parents would occasionally ask her if she wanted to terminate her engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you really want to lift it, then the Hart family can naturally pay some price, and it's okay to consider it as a return for the Quentin family's life-saving kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't make up her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because once the engagement is terminated, there really won't be any relationship between her and Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the only thing that maintains their relationship is a marriage agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on Lornell's feelings for her, after breaking the engagement, the other party is likely to completely treat her as a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a voice rose: "Harley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley turned his head and saw Tina's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina. "Harley looked at Tina and it was normal for Tina to come to the Quentin family's birthday banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you go to Lornell's side and instead stand here alone? "Tina asked.</span></p></div>
