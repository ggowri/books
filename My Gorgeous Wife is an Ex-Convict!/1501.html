        <h1>Chapter 1499</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However&hellip; Maybe Grace knew that this was the only way she could live&hellip; It was just that she did not know if she could manage to survive in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A gleam of light flashed in Secretary Wang&rsquo;s eyes. He recalled what the old master had instructed him to do before she died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;If that Grace woman really tosses her life away for Jay, then&hellip; let her live. But, she isn&rsquo;t suited to stay by Jason&rsquo;s side. The head of the Reed family cannot have any weaknesses.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;If he can&rsquo;t have any weaknesses, her death would be a good thing, wouldn't it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, the old master did not give any reply to his question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The old master had still decided to give Grace a chance at life, but she could only live if she chose to fall into the ocean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, in a small house two kilometers away from the incident, Lily was in a state of disbelief. She smashed her phone on the floor. On her beautiful face, there was an unbelievable look of twisted jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">How did Grace end up meeting such a man! Jason was willing to die for Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Why? Why?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason had been so cold to her sister. Even when she died, Jason had not shown a hint of pity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, for Grace, Jason was willing to go to such great lengths!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What put her into a state of even more disbelief was that Grace chose death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was dead?! Why did she not feel at peace?! Had she not been wishing that Grace would be dead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though Grace was dead, she had this feeling that she could never compete with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because of the way she sacrificed herself for a man, which was something Lily could never do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Due to the chaos of the whole situation, Jason was like a madman. Terrence had phoned the police and arranged for people to perform a search and rescue for Grace. At the same time, he was trying to forcibly send Jason to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After settling everything, he noticed that Secretary Wang was missing too. In regards to when he disappeared, it was unclear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Terrence was swamped by all that had happened. He had no energy to deal with Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He never thought that Secretary Wang would appear in an unlicensed clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At a clinic like this, the doctor only cared about curing the patient and did not care about their allegiances, or if they had any ID. Thus, the people here were mostly people from the criminal underworld.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The wounds they treated were mostly gunshot or blade wounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, the doctor faced a patient, who was a pregnant woman with broken bones everywhere. She was close to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her pregnant belly looked bigger than a usual pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The pregnant woman was no longer conscious, but she was still breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;You really are lucky.&rdquo; Secretary Wang looked at the unconscious Grace and said. He did what the old master had told him to and arranged for people to be under the cliff to reduce the impact of the car crashing into the ocean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once the car fell into the water, there would immediately be someone to rescue Grace out of the car.</p></div>
