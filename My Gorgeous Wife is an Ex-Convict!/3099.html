        <h1>Chapter 3097</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The end result was that he actually ended up living in her apartment, and even directly took out spare sheets to make a temporary bed on the living room sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And they also found pillows, blankets...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda feels like Brian is even more familiar with this apartment than she is.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to have noticed her confusion and said directly, "During the days when you were not here, I spent a lot of time living here and carefully counting the things in your room. So, I know everything that you have here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Did he really look at her underwear?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she never asked the question in the end!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Valda lay in bed, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Brian really stayed here, what would be the difference between now and before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And she would only sink deeper and deeper, until it became truly difficult to extricate herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But...another voice in her heart said - Valda, he loves you. Since you love each other, you should be together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Being together...just three simple words, but with so much burden to bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just in that small village, when she woke up and tried to recover her body, there were always people pointing and saying how Lisa picked up a cripple!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were also people saying even more hurtful things in front of Lisa, thinking she didn't know, but she knew everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She didn't mind how others saw her, since her job didn't require her to face too many people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she did mind how others saw Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian and she were together, there were already various rumors and gossip from the outside. At that time, she only thought that in the future, she could work hard to become a woman who deserves him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, the injury to this leg seems to have become a barrier between them, even if she tries her best, she cannot make this leg recover as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How can she still stand by his side like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This will only subject him to more criticism.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda got out of bed and didn't use her crutches. Instead, she dragged one leg slowly and lightly, taking one step at a time. She made her way out of the bedroom and arrived at the sofa in the living room, where Brian was sleeping. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, he is sleeping on the narrow sofa, with moonlight shining on his face, highlighting his beauty even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could have slept comfortably in his villa, but he insisted on squeezing into this small apartment with her. She understood his intentions very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if his love for her was out of pity, what he did was still enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just hopes that he can have a good life from now on, no matter who he ends up with, she will give her blessings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda, do you really mean your blessings? Do you truly want him to be with other women and say "love" to them? Her inner voice suddenly spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, how nice it would have been if you had said you loved me earlier," murmured Valda softly. If he had said he loved her before she got into trouble, there would have been no element of sympathy or pity, I suppose.</p></div>
