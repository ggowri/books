        <h1>Chapter 3563</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you really want to avoid struggling for a few decades, you can. Even if we don't date, I can promise you that," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His pupils suddenly shrank, looking at her in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can talk to my dad and have the Reed family sponsor you after you graduate, so you don't have to worry about your career development," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why?" he asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pursed her lips. "Because your face looks a lot like my friend's."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly let go of her hand, as if he had used all his strength!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stumbled back two steps before finally regaining his balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Miss. Reed is looking for a stand-in?" Roger sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper said, "No one can replace Lawrence, and I don't want you to be a substitute. I just hope that someone who looks similar to Lawrence in my memory can live a good life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Consider it as a way to make up for the regret that she couldn't make Lawrence's life better before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, if she hadn't been so determined to break up with Lawrence, maybe everything could have been different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Live a good life? Miss. Reed is quite generous. It seems that the Lawrence you mentioned didn't have a good life," Roger said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Think whatever you want," Jasper said. "Also, I came to talk to you today to say that I will only date people I like and who also like me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, she walked out of the piano room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger stood still for a while before raising his hand and touching his own cheek. When she touched his cheek just now, he felt flustered and didn't know what to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because of his face that she easily agreed to let him stop struggling for a few decades? Was this a way to make up for the guilt she felt towards the former Lawrence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew very well that the former Lawrence had lost everything and had fallen into hell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People who have never tasted sweetness often don't feel the bitterness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if someone gives you something sweet, and then takes it back halfway, you can no longer bear the bitterness!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, who do you like? William? Then let's see who you will choose in the future..." he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few days later, William gave Jasper a preliminary investigation report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger grew up abroad and was admitted to Stanford University as a special student due to his outstanding performance in chemistry. He is also the only heir of the Elliott family overseas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Elliott family is a relatively low-key family overseas, with few members, but they have accumulated wealth quickly over the years through multiple patents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before the age of 14, Roger was often sickly and did not attend school. Instead, he received lessons from a private tutor at home. It wasn't until he turned 14 that he officially entered school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, there is hardly any information available about Roger before the age of 14.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Accompanying this information, however, are photos of Roger taken every year since he turned 14.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at the photos and saw that 14-year-old Roger looked more like her memory of Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this information also indicates that Roger is not Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it really true that people can look alike?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have any pictures of him before he was 14?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not at the moment," William replied. "The Elliott family has never revealed any pictures of Roger before, as if they deliberately hid them."</p></div>
