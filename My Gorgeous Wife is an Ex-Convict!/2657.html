        <h1>Chapter 2655</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if they cause more trouble?" the subordinate asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If they cause more trouble, they can forget about staying in Emerald City!" the boss snapped. Forget about Brian, he would not let go of those people who dared cause trouble in his bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian carried Valda Theller into the passenger seat of his car. "I'll send you home now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed a little dazed and was still trembling slightly. After a while, she nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said nothing and only drove quietly toward Valda Theller's apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller lowered her head as if she was immersed in her thoughts. The scenes of the man kicking the door in the washroom and her being bullied in university overlapped in her mind. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people in school thought she was a scheming woman because of what Raymond Bowman said. She was cornered in the washroom, and others released snakes from the cubicle's gap. They even let out several of them at a time. Even though they were not poisonous, they were enough to make her have nightmares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She screamed and cried, but it was no use. They still blocked the door, and she could not break the door down no matter what. She did not even know how she survived that period.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until her throat was hoarse and she was exhausted that the door opened. What greeted her were more taunts and cameras taking photos of the ugly state she was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those people stood on the moral high ground as if they were judges, and she was the villain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in her opinion, they were the real villains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was an orphan. She experienced the ups and downs of life after her parents died when she was little. She thought she was tough enough, but what she experienced in university gave her a better understanding of the word &lsquo;malice&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian drove on and did not stop at the apartment compound's entrance like usual. Instead, he drove into the apartment compound and parked the car at Valda Theller's apartment block.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, we've arrived," Brian said aloud. He had called out several times for Valda Theller to come to her senses. She looked up blankly at the scene outside the car window before quickly saying, "Thank you for sending me home. Goodbye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she opened the car door. She got out shakily and walked toward the apartment building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned a little. The way she walked looked like she might fall at any time. She seemed to have had quite a shock today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pursing his thin lips, he unbuckled his safety belt, got out of the car, and hurried to her side. "Let me walk you home." Even he could not explain why he got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because she looks pitiful?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I&rsquo;ve never been a merciful man. I don't have the slightest compassion. I won't frown even if someone were to die in front of me, but why did she...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because she's my nominal girlfriend?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked blankly at Brian in front of her. Her head told her to reject him. There was no need to trouble him. All she had to do was take an elevator to get home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what she said in the end was... "Thank you." She wanted someone to keep her company. That way, perhaps the fear in her body would lessen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go, then," he said. He walked to the elevator with her and pressed the button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elevator soon came. The doors opened, and it was empty.</p></div>
