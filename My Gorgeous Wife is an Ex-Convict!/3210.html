        <h1>Chapter 3208</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her face kept getting hotter and hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian walked out of the bathroom, he saw that Valda's face had turned almost as red as a tomato.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Are you feeling okay?" Brian hurried to the bed and looked at her flushed cheeks with some concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised his hand and reached towards her forehead, his temperature slightly high. "I'll take you to the hospital," he said decisively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was stunned. What was going on?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as she saw Brian about to call the driver, she quickly grabbed his hand to stop him. "I'm fine, no need to go to the hospital!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You call this fine? Are you feverish from exhaustion? If you don't want to go to the hospital, I'll have the family doctor come over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!" she hurriedly said. If the family doctor really came, that would be embarrassing. "I just...just thought that today is our wedding night, and I got embarrassed thinking about what we're going to do later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blushed as she finally explained the reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now it was Brian's turn to be stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stood there dumbfounded, staring at Valda, a blush creeping up his cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turns out... it's because of this reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, he took a long breath and said, "It's good that you're not really sick."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry for making you misunderstand," she apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's nothing to apologize for. Like you said, today is our wedding night, blushing is normal," he said, gently embracing Valda, his voice carrying a hint of seduction. "Valda, we're husband and wife now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mm-hmm," she responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His kisses gently fell on her cheeks. "I want to have a child with you, is that okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Y-yes," she blushed and replied. He continued to kiss her, each one teasingly tantalizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you prefer a boy or a girl?" He tenderly lay on top of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Either... is fine," she stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's work hard from today onwards, okay?" He whispered softly. Because it was her, he longed to have their child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the year he waited to marry her, even if they did have a physical relationship, he took precautions to prevent her from getting pregnant before marriage. He did not want anyone to use it against her in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, finally, we don't have to worry about these things anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night was warm and sweet, feeling each other's presence and telling each other that he/she is the most important person.</p></div>
