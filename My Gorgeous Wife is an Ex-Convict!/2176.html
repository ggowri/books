        <h1>Chapter 2174</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At the end of the corridor was a piano room with an expensive piano in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the piano, William's eyes darkened as if he recalled something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chelsea said, "What's the matter? Don't you like the piano? I heard from your daddy that you like playing the piano very much, and you play it very well. We prepared this piano room for you. If you don't like this piano, we can go to the piano shop together and you can choose one yourself. We'll buy whichever piano you like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked down and said, "No, I'm okay with it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was just that it reminded him of Jasper. From now on, even if he could play the piano in this piano room every day, he could never play it with Jasper again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What about Jasper? I'm gone now. Is she going to miss me? Or is she just glad that I'm gone?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, William has just come back. He must be a little tired. Why don't I take him back to his room to rest first?" said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hearing this, Charlie Barlow and Chelsea quickly said, "Oh, he should have a rest. William is still so young. He must be tired from the long drive back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William followed Philip Barlow into his bedroom. Philip Barlow said, "This is your home from now on. You're going to live here and inherit the Barlow family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked at the person in front of him. "I only came back hoping that I can get what I want someday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow smiled and saw a glimmer of ambition in his son's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Yeah, even though my son looks sensitive and has low self-esteem, he has the Barlow family's blood flowing in him. Of course, he would have high ambitions.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Members of the Barlow family would make sure they achieved their goals once they made up their minds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I told you, you can only get what you want if you come back to the Barlow family. Look, no one in this house will look down on you. Those servants will only treat you as their young master, and no one will dare to beat you up. I&rsquo;ll also hire teachers so that you can learn more. The more you know, the better your chances are for getting what you want. I&rsquo;ll pave the way for you. Whether you can achieve your goal is up to you," said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William&rsquo;s long lashes fluttered gently as determination flickered in those pretty eyes of his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would work his way up until he got what he wanted one day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace came to Lina's place to visit the baby. Tina Stephenson had been eating and sleeping well. She was no longer as thin as when she was just born. She began to gain weight as her cheeks were chubby. One could not tell that she was born prematurely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Does Jasper still cry these days?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she learned that William's biological father had taken William away, Lina was quite surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She even had a video call with Jasper. Jasper's eyes were red in the video. As her godmother, her heart broke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She&rsquo;s stopped crying these days, but she still sleeps in William's room with Mick every day. Otherwise, there's nothing much going on. She&rsquo;s also obediently going to kindergarten," said Grace.</p></div>
