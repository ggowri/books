        <h1>Chapter 1014</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mention it. I just brought you here. If Dr. Russell said they can be cured, then they will." As Brian drove around, he asked casually, "When did you injure your hands?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's been almost four years," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Almost 4 years... It must have been when she was in prison.' Then, Brian asked again, "Did you injure them in prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent and did not reply, but the expression on her face gave him the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who did it? Who hurt you this way?" There was a trace of anger in Brian's voice. 'Who on earth treated her so cruelly?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew she was imprisoned before, but he had never given much thought to what she went through in there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only now did he realize that she had suffered such pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said lightly, "It doesn't matter anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who was it?&rdquo; Brian asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the point even if I told you? Can I make them suffer all the pain I've suffered?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not?" Brian's eyes flashed with cruelty. He would make anyone who mistreated her suffer the same way she did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at Brian in astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car stopped at a traffic light, Brian turned his head and looked at Grace earnestly. "I mean it. If you want the people who hurt you to suffer the same way you did, then I can help you. Whoever it is, I'll stand up for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's serious! The look in his eyes and the tone of his voice is telling me that he means it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace somehow felt the tip of her nose grow a little sore. She seemed to imagine the little boy lying on her back, saying, "I... I'm actually very strong. I'll protect you after we get off the hill. I'll make sure those who bullied you dare not bully you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her somewhat dry lips before saying, "No thanks. It's all over now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily and Sean represented the Atkinson and Stevens families respectively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although these two families were not as powerful as the Hart family, it would not be easy to deal with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she did not want to owe him any favors! She did not want their relationship to get any more complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only pursed his lips and said no more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car pulled up to a restaurant, he said, "Let's have dinner here today. You treated me last time, so I'll treat you today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The restaurant was an old and famous restaurant in Emerald City. It was not a luxurious restaurant, but its decor was elegant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the food was served, Grace saw that Brian had ordered pancakes&mdash;a Emerald City specialty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at the pancakes and could not help thinking of the time when they were hungry on the hill. He had said, "I'll take you to try some pancakes. The pancakes in Emerald City are delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she was living in the town with her grandmother, and Emerald City was unfamiliar to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's voice rang out. "What's the matter? Why do you keep staring at the pancakes? Their pancakes are good. They&rsquo;re delicious and one of the specialties of this restaurant. No other restaurant can make them. I've always loved their pancakes since I was a kid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace murmured, "I've had it before. It does... taste good."</p></div>
