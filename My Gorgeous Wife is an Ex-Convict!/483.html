        <h1>Chapter 482</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was just about to hand over the water he had bought for Grace when he saw her pale and frail face. He quickly asked, "What's wrong? Do you feel unwell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head. "I... I was just..." However, she seemed unable to utter a single word right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His brows furrowed. There was hardly any blood on her face now. Her forehead was covered with a thin layer of sweat. One of her hands was clutching the steering wheel while her body trembled. There was fear in her dark eyes...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like being in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just what?" he asked, putting the water bottle aside and laying his hand on her hand that was on the steering wheel. Little by little, he pulled her hand away from the wheel. "Don't be afraid. I'm here. No matter what happens, you needn't be afraid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was so strong and firm in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace closed her eyes sharply and took a couple of heavy breaths which gradually calmed the shivers in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all over. There was nothing to be afraid of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kept telling herself that. Then, she slowly opened her eyes and looked at Jason, saying, "It's all right. I just thought about the accident. Come to think of it, at least I'm lucky to be alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if she had any less luck, she might not have survived at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps this was the so-called &lsquo;heaven never sealed off all the exits?&rsquo; Even if she had to bear the injustice, she got to stay alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he grabbed her shoulders and swept her into his arms. His face was buried in her hair while his hot breath seemed to grow heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "What's the matter, Jay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should be the one acting unlike herself, but now it seemed that he was the one who was not himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason held on to Grace. When he heard her talk about the accident and saying that at least she was still alive, he suddenly remembered the information he had seen back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The information on the accident... It showed that her car was badly damaged and that if it had been mispositioned any further, her car would probably have caught fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It also said that she struggled out of the car on her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How painful would it have been for her to climb out of the car? He could have lost her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he first looked at the report, he could look at the data casually without any emotional ups and downs. It was as if she was just a meaningless nobody.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little did he know that in the future he would fall in love with the nobody he once did not care about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a good thing she was alive...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay?" Her voice once again rang in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his head slowly. His dark eyes were filled with endless attachment as if they were going to drown her. "You're right. You were... lucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was not the only one who felt lucky. He felt lucky too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in Reed Residence, Jason asked the servant to heat up the traditional medicine and bring it over.</p></div>
