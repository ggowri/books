        <h1>Chapter 221</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was the man behind Evelyn Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I'll send you the list of medicine I bought as well as a copy of the certificate for lost wages. Please pay by then." As she finished, she said to Brian, "Thank you for today, Mr. Hart. I need to go now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Grace left the lounge, leaving Brian and Evelyn alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at Evelyn coldly, frightening her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn managed to squeeze out a smile. "Brian, why are you looking at me like that? By the way... You and my sister... Well, do you know each other?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, do you want to pry into this as well?" Brian asked without a reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm just curious. I've never heard my sister mention it," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Right, your sister lives in a shabby and small rental house. She&rsquo;s sweeping the road as her job. Now, as an extra, she had to keep kneeling and groveling to you, her sister, for a mere 330 dollars. Why would she mention it to you?" There was a rare chill in Brian's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For Evelyn, at least, it was the first time he had spoken to her in such a cold voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn unconsciously shivered a little. "Brian... My sister and I have some misunderstanding..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, what kind of misunderstanding do you two have that you would make her kneel and grovel over and over again?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn felt a pang of panic. "I... I just wanted the film to look better. Sis did it right, so I thought of... letting her demonstrate. I... It wasn&rsquo;t my intention to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn stammered. As she tried to make herself appear innocent, she just grew more and more nervous as Brian watched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. You don&rsquo;t need to say anymore. How many people do you think will believe your excuses?" Brian interrupted coldly. "Do you take yourself for a fool or do you think I'm a fool?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face turned pale, and she felt as if he had seen through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian casually took Evelyn's hand. Her thin and fair wrist was wearing a diamond-encrusted limited-edition watch that was on the market for two million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you feel that you have become successful and want to show off to your sister? You want her to know how much power you have now by getting her to kneel and grovel and do whatever you want when you know that she can't even fight back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed to speak casually, but Evelyn listened in horror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come to think of it, I've given you a lot of things during this time too. Some other people have also secretly given you a lot in order to please you. Simply pick out anything you have on you, and your sister probably won't be able to earn enough for it even after several years. How about you? Have you not thought about helping her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Evelyn's eyes were wide open, but she could not utter a complete word. She was shaking like a sieve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought that she had been secretive about the &lsquo;respect&rsquo; she was receiving from others who wanted her to put in a good word for them with Brian. In fact, she had helped these folks who &lsquo;respect&rsquo; her a few times prior. Just by intentionally bringing up good things about them in front of him indirectly helped complete favors for them.</p></div>
