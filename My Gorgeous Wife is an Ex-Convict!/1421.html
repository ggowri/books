        <h1>Chapter 1420</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if he had stepped on the edge of a cliff and the slightest movement would crush him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Paid? Say what she wanted?" Martin Weiss said dryly, his eyes full of anger. "Aren't you a doctor? Aren't you supposed to save lives? But you went and harmed people! You put an innocent person in prison!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Startled by Martin Weiss's anger, the man stammered, "I... I only said in court that Paisley Daniels was pregnant and miscarried. I didn&rsquo;t say anything else. Mr. Weiss, weren't you the one who testified that Paisley Daniels was pushed down the stairs by that woman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His words were like a slap in the face, and Martin Weiss was immediately speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back then... It was true that he had been the one who testified that Kyla had pushed Paisley Daniels down the stairs!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His testimony was all that mattered! It was because of his testimony that the judge finally declared Kyla guilty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss did not know what to say all of a sudden. The blood coursing through his body seemed to have frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If Paisley Daniels was not pregnant at the time, then there couldn&rsquo;t have been a miscarriage. Martin Weiss, you said in your testimony that you saw blood on the hem of Paisley Daniels's dress. Where did the blood come from? Don't you find it strange?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's lips trembled, and he closed his eyes while the memories of what had happened back then came back to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Paisley Daniels was so thoroughly prepared. She fell down the stairs and claimed that Kyla had pushed her. She could not have predicted when she would be pushed down the stairs, but Paisley Daniels somehow managed to get the timing right and even prepared blood beforehand. Did she predict the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss, did you really see Kyla push her at that time? Or did you assume Kyla did it because Paisley Daniels said so?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You could have found out the truth if you had any trace of doubt and investigated it! But you just couldn&rsquo;t wait to retaliate against Kyla, so Paisley Daniels handed you the knife and you stabbed Kyla with it! Even if you had some doubts, you probably would&rsquo;ve turned a blind eye!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every word Grace said seemed to be hurting Martin Weiss, overwhelming him with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It turned out what he owed Kyla and the things he had done to wrong her were more than he previously imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Enough! Stop it!" murmured Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace continued saying, "Enough? It's not enough at all! Martin Weiss, you know what? You ruined Kyla's love and her wonderful life! Do you know what it's like to be in prison? Do you know what she has suffered in prison? You&rsquo;ve never suffered Kyla's pain. Who are you to say it's enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly opened his eyes and gasped heavily. His lips trembled, and his mouth opened as if he wanted to ask something but he did not say anything in the end. He blankly turned around and left the visiting room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He walked out, and each step he took was particularly difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if all his strength was being sucked away while the pangs of pain swept through him and spread through his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Yes, Grace is right. Paisley Daniels handed me the knife, but I was the one who stabbed her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If I hadn't testified in court, Kyla wouldn't have been jailed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But I... only saw the result. I only saw the moment when Paisley Daniels fell down the stairs. I didn't see Kyla push her at all. But I said in court that Kyla had pushed Paisley Daniels down the stairs!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I put the person I love the most in prison!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly stumbled and fell to his knees on the ground. He raised his fist and beat his heart hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It hurt! His heart hurt so much!</p></div>
