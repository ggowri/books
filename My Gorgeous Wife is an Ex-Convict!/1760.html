        <h1>Chapter 1758</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Once you've transferred the money and that we're safely out of here, I'll tell you what I fed him! I have to take some measures to protect myself too, right?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I hope you keep your word! Otherwise, no one's going to have it easy!" Grace took a deep breath and began transferring the money on the laptop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She transferred the money to the designated account as required.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The man handed Mason to her. The moment Grace held him, the man whispered, "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace froze. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the female voice on the phone said, "I've got the money. Grace, you owe me this! This is an auspicious place that I found for you! How about you die here with the man you once loved? Isn't that great?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What did you say?" Sean, who was wearing the Monkey King mask, was surprised. This was not what they had agreed on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What the hell is Lily doing?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's exactly as I said. The place is going to explode soon. I've planted so many explosives on this hill that it'll be too late for you even if you run down as fast as you can!" the female voice said triumphantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lily!" Grace shouted her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Haha, so you do know who I am." Lily did not seem surprised. "I knew you'd learn that I&rsquo;m the one behind this from the beginning, but so what? Jason and his men are all at the foot of the hill. Even if his men are surrounding the entire foot of the hill, there's nothing they can do about the explosion!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily said maliciously, "Grace, I want you to die in front of Jason!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lily! You said you just wanted the money. Why... Why would you do this?" Sean bellowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sean, you are so naive!" Lily chuckled and said, "I want money and Grace's life. By the way, since you're dying, I have something to tell you. William wasn't kidnapped, and he's not your son. Sean, you're not worthy enough to have a son like William!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What?" Sean yanked the mask off his face and stared at the phone in shock. "What did you say? William isn't my son?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily snapped, "Sean, you and the Stevens family only thought about saving the Stevens family and got rid of me when the Atkinson family was in trouble. Why should I bear a child for a man like you? I'll enjoy a good life with this money. You and Grace can die together... Ah, who are you? Don't... Don't think about coming over..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, there was a commotion on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In a small, semi-deserted village not far from the hill where they had the transaction, Lily was in disbelief as she looked at the people surrounding her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was leading them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why is Jason here? Shouldn't Jason be waiting anxiously for Grace at the foot of the hill?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had everything planned out. Jason would nervously rush up the hill to look for Grace after the explosion. The place would be in chaos then and she would be able to take advantage of it to make her escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But...' Lily turned to look at the image shown on her phone. On the screen, &lsquo;Jason&rsquo; was still at the foot of the hill, while there was no one at the entrance of the house she was in now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
