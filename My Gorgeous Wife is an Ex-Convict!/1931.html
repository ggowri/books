        <h1>Chapter 1929</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At that moment, he realized that he would always forgive her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was only saying it when he said he would not forgive her before this. He could never do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace instantly felt awkward, knowing that Jason was recalling what had happened between them before. Therefore, she said, "Jay, let's not have any more misunderstandings!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just like the misunderstanding between Lina and Hadwin Stephenson. If Katherine Jackson had not been so smug as to tell Lina, would Lina forever be in the dark and lose Hadwin Stephenson for good?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sometimes, maybe even the most passionate love was no match for a misunderstanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want her and Jay to encounter the same situation. It would be utterly unfortunate and ridiculous if they lost each other because of a misunderstanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason replied, "Okay, no more misunderstandings between us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney, Mrs. Sweeney, and Lina got on the high-speed rail to J City. Lina was anxious during the entire trip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Almost every time she closed her eyes recently, she would think of her time with Hadwin Stephenson&mdash;the happy times, painful times, sad times...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What appeared in her mind the most was the dim look in Hadwin Stephenson's eyes. His eyes were a gloomy gray as if he was completely disappointed in her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, stop thinking about it. We'll arrive in J City in three more hours," said Mrs. Sweeney. She knew her daughter was thinking about Hadwin Stephenson again when she saw the way she looked. "Come and eat something so you won&rsquo;t go hungry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney said as she opened the insulated lunchbox, which contained some snacks she had prepared. They were still warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina picked up a pastry and ate it bite by bite. Although these delicious snacks tasted like wax to her at the moment, she continued eating. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because her body was no longer her own now. Even if she had no appetite for anything, she was eating all this for her baby so they could grow up healthily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She thought three hours would go by slowly, but when she arrived at the train station in J City, Lina felt that time had passed so quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was now three o&rsquo;clock. Could she... meet Hadwin Stephenson?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They had booked the hotel beforehand, and it was near Stephenson Group's headquarters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When they got to the hotel, Lina said, "Mom, Dad, I want to go to Stephenson Group and see if I can meet Hadwin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We'll go with you," said Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks. The building is nearby. It's only a few minutes away from here. This is between Hadwin and me. I want to handle it myself. It&rsquo;ll be awkward if you guys are around," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, she did not want to involve her parents in her relationship anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her parents had done a lot for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney wanted to say something, but Mr. Sweeney pulled his wife and said, "Alright, let her deal with her relationship herself. She's an adult and is going to be a mother soon. There are things she has to deal with herself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney sighed at this but stopped fussing about going with her.</p></div>
