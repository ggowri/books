        <h1>Chapter 2927</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, the transportation department had located the car, which was parked in front of a hotel. Upon learning the name of the hotel, Valda Theller rushed to go there, but Brian Hart stopped her and asked if she knew the exact address. She suggested using Google Maps, but he insisted on taking her there himself. As they rode in his car, Brian Hart made phone calls to direct his subordinates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller listened as Brian Hart calmly arranged everything, giving her a sense of reassurance. She thanked him for his help, as she had been at a loss after searching for the bar manager and the police when Camille went missing. But Brian Hart had been able to find Camille's whereabouts step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart raised his hand and gently stroked Valda Theller's red eyes, telling her not to cry. He had been so nervous when he heard her choked-up voice on the phone, afraid that something bad had happened to her. He advised her not to go to bars like that in the future, as they were dangerous, but offered to introduce her to some good ones if she really wanted to go. Valda Theller obediently nodded, having learned her lesson from this experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They soon arrived at the hotel, where someone was waiting for them. Brian Hart asked if the police had been called, and the person confirmed that they had. He ordered them to guard all the exits and to bring more people to help search for the missing person. Six people followed Brian Hart and Valda Theller into the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller showed the hotel owner a photo of her friend and a screenshot of the surveillance footage of another woman helping Camille walk, asking which room they had gone to. The owner claimed not to understand and said that they had too many guests to remember. Valda Theller became more anxious and asked them to check the registration records for the past half hour. The owner hesitated, clearly trying to stall for time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart gestured to his subordinates, and one of them immediately pressed the owner's head against the table. The others checked the computer and the hotel's written records. The owner protested, but Brian Hart was not afraid of her threats to call the police. They found the room number, 506, and Valda Theller rushed to the elevator, with Brian Hart following closely behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they reached the fifth floor, Valda Theller knocked on the door of room 506 and called out for Camille, but there was no response. Brian Hart used a key card to open the door, and Valda Theller rushed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The room was pitch black, and she fumbled for the light switch. Suddenly, something seemed to attack her in the darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Following that, there was a muffled groan and the sound of a scuffle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was a brief moment, lasting no more than ten seconds. Subsequently, the indoor lighting illuminated.</p></div>
