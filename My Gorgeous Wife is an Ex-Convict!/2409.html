        <h1>Chapter 2407</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Moss, Miss Cummins is my friend. If the Moss family does anything to her, I can guarantee that the Moss family won't be safe in Deer City." Brian's voice suddenly rang out in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss looked at Brian. "Mr. Hart, you're very thoughtful of your friends. But is it worth making an enemy out of the Moss family just for a friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I owe my life to her. Do you think it's not worth it, then?" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss and his wife left. Then, Grace said, "You don't have to do that to the Moss family for me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I know you've never had romantic feelings for me, and I won't expect anything else, but it's up to me to decide if it's worth it," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know what else to say. She could only get up and say goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not offer to send her back, but when Grace took a taxi back to the hotel, Brian's car followed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car reached the hotel, Grace got out and was surprised to see a figure at the hotel&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surprised and hurried toward Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, didn't you say you weren't coming until tomorrow?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came a day earlier after finishing my work on hand," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about Mick and Jasper? Didn&rsquo;t they come with you?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They went to Philip Barlow's place first," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that her daughter was probably eager to see William, so Mick probably followed Jasper there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Our two children are at the Barlow family&rsquo;s house and are protected by bodyguards. Nothing will happen. I wanted to see you as soon as possible, so I came to the hotel first. How have you been these days?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he raised his hand and caressed her fringe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Me? I'm fine. It's just that..." she was speaking when she felt his hand pause. He was looking past her at somewhere behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze. Then, she turned around and found Brian's car parked not far away. Brian was looking in their direction through the car window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Jay looking at... Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought had just flashed through her mind when she instantly felt his hand around her waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When did you meet Brian?" His voice rang silently in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At a party the other day." When she finished speaking, he had taken her hand and hurried into the hotel.</p></div>
