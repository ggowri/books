        <h1>Chapter 401</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought she could not sleep with Jason lying beside her, but she fell asleep as soon as she closed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if his presence gave her peace of mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she woke up the next day, Grace saw Jason in a white shirt. He was buttoning up the cuffs as he walked toward her. "Are you awake?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she said as she blushed a little. She had not washed her face or brushed her teeth. Plus, her hair was a mess too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you sleep well last night? I had a good night's sleep," he said and stooped down. His hands were propped on the edge of the bed, his dark eyes looking straight into hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With their gazes almost at eye level, Grace was suddenly at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She subconsciously leaned back, wanting to distance herself from him. However, his hand grabbed her back with a slight force. Suddenly, the distance between them became even closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Were you unable to sleep well, Sis?" he asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was... It was all right..." she answered with a slight stutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great!" he said and kissed her cheek quite naturally. "Go downstairs for breakfast when you&rsquo;re done washing up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she answered, blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After going into the bathroom and washing herself up, Grace came downstairs and found Jason sitting at the table. He was apparently waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For breakfast, they were served both Chinese and Western-style food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want to eat? "asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll have a bowl of porridge," answered Grace. The servant then placed a bowl of porridge and some appetizers before Grace with some refreshments to go with the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace accidentally looked up as she ate and noticed Jason looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing, I just think you look cute when you eat," he said, raising his finger and brushing the corner of her mouth across the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a grain of rice that was at the corner of her mouth was stuck to his finger. Then, she watched him stick out the tip of his tongue and gently lick the grain of rice that was on his fingertip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He&hellip; was seducing her in broad daylight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face went red immediately. She found herself blushing more and more these days. She never knew that a man would look so attractive doing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's sweet." He smiled at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly buried herself in her porridge, not daring to look at him again for fear that her nose might actually bleed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing breakfast, Grace saw Jason get up to take a tie from a servant nearby. He then walked up to her and handed her the tie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tie it for me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, but he had already shoved the tie into her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Clutching the tie in her hand, Grace suddenly got a mixed feeling. She had helped Sean with his tie before. Back then, Sean even joked that he was now tied to her for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, how could people be tied together so easily?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, it was all self-deception.</p></div>
