        <h1>Chapter 3320</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his heart, he already had a faint answer, but it wasn't until now that he finally had the courage to ask it out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two police officers who brought him to the hospital exchanged a glance but did not immediately respond to his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's body trembled, his black eyes looked empty and gloomy, "Have my parents... already passed away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a 10-year-old, he already understands the meaning of death quite well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two police officers looked pained, and one of them reached out to pat his head. "Alright, you're going to have surgery soon. We'll talk about everything after the surgery is done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence was pushed into the cold operating room, knowing that he would never see his mommy and daddy again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he understands that his parents have many flaws, especially his mother who owes money to many people and is often cursed at by debt collectors using harsh words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even so, he still wants to see his mommy again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, tears finally welled up in Lawrence's eyes and began to flow down his cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the second day, Grace learned about the news of the Abbott couple being killed by loan sharks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on here?" She looked at her husband in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she didn't like the Abbott couple, especially Wilona's gambling habit, it never occurred to her that they would die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason explained to Grace what he knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Lawrence? The child didn't die?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He should still be alive," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Should be?" Grace was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The child escaped with a hand injury and was sent to the hospital for treatment. After the surgery, the child was supposed to be sent to the ward, but in the middle of the night, the child disappeared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Grace was suddenly shocked. "Lawrence disappeared?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He was drugged and taken out of the hospital secretly," Jason said. This was also discovered by the police through surveillance footage after the fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does that mean..." Grace thought of a certain possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the Abbott couple were killed by someone, Lawrence became a witness because he saw the killer's face. That's why the kidnapper took the child, so that Lawrence couldn't identify the killer later on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence is in great danger now. If the culprit's people have taken him away, it's very likely that they want to silence him," Grace said urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm." Jason also leaned towards his wife's guess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jason, if we rely solely on the police to search, it may not be in time. Can you send people to search together?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Abbott couple has passed away. She doesn't want Lawrence to suffer the same fate, especially with the child whom she actually likes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's nothing that can't be done between us. As long as it's something you wish for, I can make it happen for you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, let's not let Jasper know about this for now," said Grace. Although her daughter is currently angry with Lawrence, it is precisely because she values him that she is angry, and she has been angry for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If my daughter were to find out about the tragedy of the Abbott family and Lawrence's uncertain fate, it would be a huge blow to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand. I will give the order. Don't let the children know about this," said Jason. He knew that not only Jasper, but the other children as well, should not find out. Otherwise, there was a risk that Jasper would eventually find out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And so, the Reed family began sending people to search for Lawrence's whereabouts.</p></div>
