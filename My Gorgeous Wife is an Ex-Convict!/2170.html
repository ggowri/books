        <h1>Chapter 2168</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, she was suddenly tapped on the shoulder. She was shocked. She turned around only to realize that the person who tapped her shoulder was her brother, Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why did you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I saw you going out, so I followed you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Brother, do you know who that uncle William came out with is? What does he have to do with William?" Jasper asked humbly. Every time she had questions, she would call him &lsquo;Brother&rsquo;. Usually, she would only call him &lsquo;Mo Mo&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although Mick Reed thought &lsquo;Mo Mo&rsquo; sounded like a girl's name, he let it slide when his sister called him that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's William's daddy," Mick Reed replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Daddy?" Jasper almost choked. Her face was full of shock. It was different from Mick Reed's expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"His name is Philip Barlow. Daddy was looking into the Barlow family. I hacked Daddy's computer once and found the information on it," said Mick Reed. However, not long after he hacked the computer, his father found out and... he got a good scolding from his father and was banned from touching the computer for a week. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Who... is this Uncle Barlow?" asked Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed said, "He's from Deer City. The Barlow Group in Deer City is his. He seems to have come here for William."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper Reed's pretty little eyebrows furrowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is William's daddy... here to pick up William?' Although she was mad at William for lying and refusing to apologize to Nelson, she still could not help missing him. As long as he apologized and promised not to do it again, she would still make up with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to play the piano with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After seeing him get beaten up like that, he still wanted to play the piano with her. She got inexplicably angry when that happened. She was angry at how he still wanted to play the piano when he was already injured!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Later, when she went to get him some medicine to tend to his wounds, she found that her mother was already doing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the evening, she thought of talking with him and asking whether he was in pain. However, she hesitated when she reached his room door and ultimately did not go in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her mother had always taught her to be an honest child, so she wanted William to be one too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Jasper and Mick Reed returned to the classroom, William was already there. The teachers had also realized that the two children were missing. They were scrambling to find them when they realized that they were back. They were relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed made an excuse and said he had sneaked out with his sister. The teachers only told them not to sneak out again, so the incident was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper looked at William, who was standing silently nearby. She wanted to go up to him and ask him why his father had come to visit him. He had never told her about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she stopped again after taking only one step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Did he not tell me because he didn't think of me as his best friend?' The speculation flashed across Jasper Reed's mind, and she did not take another step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the evening, Jason called William into his study. "I know your father stopped by the kindergarten to see you today."</p></div>
