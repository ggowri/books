        <h1>Chapter 2277</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those deep black eyes stared intently at her. Looking at his gaze, it was as though he wanted to look at her forever. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze for a while before quickly sitting up. With her face slightly red, she said to Martin Weiss, "I... I'm going back to my ward first. You... You should continue getting some rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she quickly got out of bed and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes were on Kyla until her figure disappeared from the ward. Then, he slowly looked down at his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands were still wrapped in gauze, and he had injuries all over his body. However, his heart was jubilant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had laid down by his side last night, sleeping peacefully with him. He had been longing for this all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He cherished it even if it was only done out of sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after she fell asleep, he kept his eyes open, looking at her. He was afraid that all this would disappear if he closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been telling himself not to expect anything. All he had to do in this life was to silently protect her and not disturb her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a faint sense of hope vaguely rose in his heart again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hope seemed to grow stronger, especially at the sight of the blush on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could he... expect more?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she not entirely indifferent to him? Did he still have a place in her heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla... will you give me another chance? Just one more time... I&rsquo;ll live up to it this time, no matter what happens," his lips murmured almost silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just one more time... All he wanted was one chance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla ran back to her ward next door and arrived at the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mirror above the sink reflected her slightly flustered expression, and the blush on her cheeks seemed to be telling her something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took a deep breath, quickly picked up the towel, and washed her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's wrong with me? I unconsciously fell asleep in Martin Weiss's hospital bed. I&rsquo;m so flustered right now.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This panic was not only because she spent a night in Martin Weiss's ward but also because... Kyla raised her hand to her heart. She could feel that her heartbeat was far more intense than usual. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had negotiated with the police to suppress the incident, so the kidnapping was not reported in the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police also came to the hospital to take Kyla's statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla found out what had happened from the police. Mr. Lambert had confessed to everything, and it turned out that Jacqueline Bowman was involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The amulet that Jacqueline Bowman gave her was why she fell unconscious in the car. It contained a fragrance that could induce coma, especially in a confined space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was why Jacqueline Bowman made up an excuse and left her alone in the car after giving her the amulet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was not too surprised that Jacqueline Bowman was involved. After all, she had already thought of the possibility earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she still felt disappointed after getting a definitive answer from the police.</p></div>
