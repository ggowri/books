        <h1>Chapter 2939</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It is precisely because I have loved Grace that I am unsure now," he once knew that his feelings for Grace were love, but later on, love gradually turned into obsession. Now, his feelings for Valda Theller are different from those for Grace, but... "However, I am very clear that I like Valda Theller and do not want her to be hurt in any way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, I really don't understand you," Patrick Weiss raked his hair and said, "It's so simple for others to fall in love, why does it become so difficult when it comes to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, if you're not busy, then please leave. I want to rest," Brian Hart issued a direct order to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, I came all the way here to see you, and you're just going to kick me out like this?" Patrick Weiss complained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do I have to keep you in my hospital room for dinner?" Brian Hart retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Patrick Weiss choked on his words, "Are you taking it out on me because Valda Theller left?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two sharp gazes stared directly at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'm leaving!" Patrick Weiss quickly said, knowing that the patient's wishes come first. He got up and walked to the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, by the way, Valda Theller said she was just going home to get something and will be back soon," Patrick Weiss said before leaving the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hospital room, only Brian Hart remained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was stunned for a moment, and then he raised his hand to cover his forehead, awkwardly smiling for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just now, he was feeling down because Valda Theller had left, but now, because of Patrick Weiss's words, he was feeling elated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All his emotional ups and downs were all because of Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was wrong with him... Even though he liked Valda Theller, this was too much...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the door of the hospital room was opened again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing back here? Do you have something else to say to me?" Brian Hart sighed, thinking that it was Patrick Weiss who had come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um... if you don't want me to come back, then I'll just stay outside the room," a timid voice sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart suddenly froze and looked up at the figure standing at the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was carrying a backpack and standing there with a puzzled expression on her face. Her round eyes were as cute as a squirrel's, and he wanted those eyes to always look at him like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart was beating fast, and he slowly opened his mouth, "No, I really like it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He liked her being by his side, he liked her looking at him, he liked her so much that he couldn't even describe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was his feelings for her really just liking her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, he couldn't help but doubt it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller went back to take a shower, changed her clothes, and brought her sketchbook, intending to draw when the hospital was quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all these years of drawing, if she didn't draw for a day, she would sometimes feel itchy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Brian Hart took his medicine and fell asleep, but Valda Theller still couldn't sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She held her sketchbook and drew Brian Hart while he was sleeping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, only when he was asleep, she dared to draw him. If he was awake, she wouldn't have the courage to draw him, afraid that when she was drawing him, she would meet his gaze and couldn't control her own feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she finished the last stroke, she looked at him on the paper, feeling a little dazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The painting reflects the heart. This painting seems to be telling her how much she loves this man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some emotions, even if she tried to restrain and forget them, might not be as controllable as her rational mind thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If emotions could be controlled by reason, then perhaps they could not be called emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her mind, she couldn't help but think of what Patrick Weiss said earlier today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she really the only one who could pull Brian Hart out of the dead end? And if she missed Brian Hart, would she regret it for the rest of her life?</p></div>
