        <h1>Chapter 3340</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There will naturally be many eyes watching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, there were also many glances that were directed towards her dear husband. Grace thought to herself, and after taking her seat, she whispered to Jason, "Have you noticed that many people are looking at you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't feel anything, anyway, as long as you're looking at me, that's all that matters," Jason said with a slight smile, lifting the corners of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that smile and those peach blossom eyes, she exuded a charm that was both alluring and endlessly captivating, causing Grace's heart to race uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though they have been married for many years, Grace still falls for his charm and cannot resist him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, the play is about to start in a little while," blushed Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason smiled and replied with a simple "okay".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the musical began, Jasper watched with particular attention, as if he wanted to remember every detail to tell Lawrence about it later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William occasionally stole glances at Jasper. He had accompanied her to musicals before, but it was the first time he had seen her so engrossed in one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And her seriousness is all because of Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he feels a sour and bitter sensation in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the musical ended, the theater lights came on and many people started to stand up and leave. However, Jasper remained seated and didn't immediately get up. Instead, he closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper?" Grace looked at her daughter strangely and spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Jasper remained silent and kept his eyes closed. It was William who spoke up, saying, "Auntie Grace, Jasper is probably studying the content of a musical."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, after a moment, Jasper opened his eyes and said, "I remember it all! The next time I find Lawrence, I'll be able to tell him the whole story of this musical."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace gently stroked her daughter's head and said, "Okay, when the time comes, you can slowly tell Lawrence yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm." Jasper finally smiled, "Lawrence will be very happy to hear this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's smile brightened even more at the thought of Lawrence's happy expression when he arrives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few people walked out of the theater, and as Jasper walked, she shared the information she wanted to tell Lawrence with her parents and William, just in case she missed anything and they could help fill in the gaps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jasper tells the story, she also imitates the characters' expressions and tone of voice, and even dances and draws with her hands, which is quite lifelike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace just realized that her daughter has a talent in this area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, no one noticed that in a corner outside the theater, next to an old beggar, there was a small beggar crouching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little beggar had messy hair and a dirty face, and his whole body looked extremely filthy. However, his eyes were very clear and bright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, those eyes were fixed on Jasper who was dancing around, with a look of disappointment, discomfort, and...hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, she was the high and mighty young lady, but to him, she was just an insignificant person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought they were friends and that she was a genuinely kind person to him, but in reality, it wasn't like that at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His parents passed away and he disappeared, but she didn't feel sad at all. She still dressed up beautifully and went to see the musical with someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Jasper suddenly stopped and looked around in all directions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" William asked. "Jasper, why did you stop talking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The nearby little beggar quickly lowered his head and moved his small body behind the old beggar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much... just feel like someone is watching me," Jasper murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace laughed, "Of course, someone was watching you. When you were speaking, many people were looking at you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked a bit embarrassed and asked, "Did I speak in a way that was not very pleasant just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, she spoke very eloquently!" Grace said. "When Lawrence hears it in the future, he will definitely be very happy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's mood lifted up again.</p></div>
