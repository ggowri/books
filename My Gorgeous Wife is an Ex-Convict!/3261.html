        <h1>Chapter 3259</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's first bout of vomiting occurred in the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was sketching when suddenly a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly got up, covered her mouth, and rushed to the bathroom where she vomited for a while. The feeling of nausea only subsided after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, are you feeling unwell?" asked the assistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My stomach feels a bit uncomfortable, maybe because I ate too much for breakfast," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian came to pick up Valda after work in the afternoon, he noticed that she didn't look too good. "What's wrong?" he asked, furrowing his brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the moment, she looks a bit paler than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe what I ate this morning didn't sit well with me, so tonight I want to eat something lighter," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's have some porridge tonight, it's easy to digest," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." She didn't have any objections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he drove and took her directly to a congee restaurant that she usually likes to eat at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is the Reed family's relatively humble congee shop. It's currently dinner time and there are already quite a few customers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finding a seat, Valda and Brian ordered porridge. Valda noticed someone at the next table drinking sour plum juice and suddenly felt like having some too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's up? You keep looking over there?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I suddenly feel like having sour plum juice," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian glanced at the person next to them holding a cup of sour plum juice with a logo from a nearby beverage shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait here, I'll go buy it," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian got up and headed outside the porridge shop towards the beverage shop next door, while Valda stayed put and waited for their food to arrive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the side dishes arrived and Valda took a bite, but suddenly felt nauseous. She covered her mouth and rushed towards the restroom in the porridge shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian bought the sour plum juice and returned to the porridge shop, only to find Valda's seat empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Where was Valda?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His heart suddenly panicked, he turned his head and looked around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After scanning the area, Brian didn't see Valda. His panic grew more and more evident, his body trembling involuntarily. Even the hand holding the sour plum juice was shaking, causing some of the juice to spill onto his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda...she can't be in trouble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter what, she can't be in trouble!</p></div>
