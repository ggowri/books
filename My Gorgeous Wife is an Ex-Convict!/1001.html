        <h1>Chapter 1000</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina would like Nelson to call her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;, but she was embarrassed considering that the little one had always called Grace &lsquo;Aunty&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson looked at Lina and his mother with those beautiful eyes wide open. Although he was still young, he sort of understood that he could go to kindergarten because of the unfamiliar uncle and aunt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Aunty Sweeney," Nelson said in a childlike voice, but the words were clear. Lina could not believe this was a deaf child if it was not for the hearing aid he wore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha. Don't mention it, don't mention it!" Lina said with a smile before pointing to her cheek, gesturing for a kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pretty little face turned a little red, but Nelson did not reject the smiling woman. He put his two little arms around Lina's neck and kissed her on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like the tender kiss of a cherub. Lina was so happy that she could not help picking up the little one and kissing him several times on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson's tender little face immediately turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin looked at how his girlfriend was behaving like a weird woman with her eyes twinkling and felt a rush of jealousy. He had not forgotten that she said she would pursue the little one if she was 20 years younger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he knew it was ridiculous to be jealous of a child, he could not help thinking that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, when Lina was happily fangirling over the child, Hadwin reached his long arms out and saved Nelson from Lina's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, all of you must be hungry. Let's find somewhere to eat first," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina seemed to be unhappy that Hadwin took Nelson from her arms so suddenly. However, she recoiled a little after Hadwin glared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin found a restaurant and booked a private room. After ordering the food, he gave Kyla the principal's contact information. "You can take Nelson to register and go through the formalities tomorrow. I've already told him about it. They know about Nelson's special situation and agreed to take Nelson in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you. Thank you so much." Kyla thanked him again. Her son's kindergarten issue was like a stone weighing heavily on her heart these days, and now, it was settled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While they were eating, Lina chatted and started gossiping. "By the way, Grace, your cousin has been around Brian a lot lately. Many people think she&rsquo;s Brian's girlfriend. Yesterday, Brian admitted in an interview that he and your cousin aren&rsquo;t a couple. He said he&rsquo;s in love with someone else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and looked at Lina in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kai Kai's Talk Show, right? It's pretty popular. People who go on the show are top artists or popular celebrities. Brian has never gone on talk shows, but he went on one yesterday and revealed such a huge story. The internet is full of speculations about who Brian is in love with!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, Lina was a master of gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. 'Did Brian... really say that on the show?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Grace with some shock. She had a feeling that Brian might be referring to Grace as the person he was in love with. After all, Brian had come to her restaurant several times to see Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Brian was willing to hold back the fact that she was in Emerald City from Martin Weiss for Grace's sake as well. </p></div>
