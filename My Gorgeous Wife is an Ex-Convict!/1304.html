        <h1>Chapter 1303</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason enjoyed Grace's gentle caress. After quite some time, he said, "Alright, let's get in the car." With that, he glared at Terrence who was still gaping in shock out of the corners of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence trembled before coming back to his senses and quickly lowering his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh. Did I just see something I shouldn't have seen? Will Master Reed kill me to keep it a secret?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting into the car and driving for a short time, Terrence's phone rang. A moment after answering the phone, Terrence turned to Jason in the back seat and reported, "Master Reed, Hadwin Stephenson has shown up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace exclaimed, "What? Where's Hadwin Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At the Jackson family's house in J City. Hadwin Stephenson only showed up secretly. The police are still unaware of this, and the Stephenson family probably isn&rsquo;t aware of it either," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was once again stunned. 'The Jackson family?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Elizabeth Jackson's Jackson family?" she asked hurriedly. After all, Elizabeth Jackson had once approached Lina to show her who was boss, saying something about her being the fianc&eacute;e the Stephenson family had arranged for Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Afterward, she and Lina almost had a car accident, which was also plotted by Elizabeth Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson hurried back to the Jackson family's house because of this incident!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but Elizabeth Jackson is just the Jackson family's adopted daughter. Now, the Jackson family's real heiress is back. She's called Katherine Jackson. Hadwin Stephenson secretly went back to the Jackson family's house with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Why did Katherine Jackson go back with Hadwin Stephenson? And why didn't Hadwin Stephenson go to the police?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... Can you get in touch with Hadwin Stephenson?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence shook his head. "No, it was only by chance that we found Hadwin Stephenson secretly entering and leaving the Jackson family's house. Besides, J City isn't our territory, after all. Our men can&rsquo;t go anywhere near Hadwin Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent, wondering why Hadwin Stephenson was with members of the Jackson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gently patted Grace's shoulder. "Alright, don't overthink it. At least it proves Hadwin Stephenson is still alive and well! We can find out why he's with the Jackson family later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. They could only leave things at that first. However, she wondered whether Hadwin Stephenson knew about Lina's current situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Hadwin Stephenson loves Lina so much. He&rsquo;ll certainly come to see Lina if he finds out!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... why don't you try and see if you can pass a message to Hadwin Stephenson. Tell Hadwin Stephenson about Lina's current situation. In any case, Lina... really needs him right now," Grace said after thinking it over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hoped Lina could see Hadwin Stephenson when she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll ask my men to try and pass the message to Hadwin Stephenson." Jason agreed and changed the subject, saying, "It's almost noon. Is there anything you want to eat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine with anything," she said. Her mind was still occupied with Hadwin Stephenson and Lina's matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned slightly and raised his hand to grab Grace's chin so that her face was facing him. "You care about Lina and Kyla Corbyn. Can you care more about me, your husband? Can you just think of me when you're with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face immediately turned red. The word &lsquo;husband&rsquo; gave her a strange feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of... Of course, I care about you too," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How much do you care about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh..." She blinked. 'Is he... jealous?'</p></div>
