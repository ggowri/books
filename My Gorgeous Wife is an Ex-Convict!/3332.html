        <h1>Chapter 3330</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you remember the documents we signed when we got married? So there's no such thing as prenuptial property between us. My half, whether it's before or after marriage, is yours," Brian smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was stunned. She remembered signing a bunch of documents, but she didn't ask what they were for. She thought they were just part of the wedding process!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she didn't expect that he had given her half of his property directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, this 2 billion is not all of your current assets. Just keep it well. It's my parents' way of showing their love, don't think too much of it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay..." Valda still hadn't fully processed her current net worth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly realized that she was super rich, and it felt like she hadn't woken up yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After chatting with Brian for a while, Valda yawned and felt tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you sleepy?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah," Valda nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you should get some good sleep now. When the baby wakes up later, you won't be able to sleep again." He said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you?" she asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not sleepy yet. You go ahead and sleep. Your body is already weak after giving birth, and I usually don't need much sleep. If I do get tired, I'll go to sleep," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay then, remember to sleep when you're tired," she said, slowly closing her eyes and falling asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at Valda's sleeping face with tenderness in his eyes. "Valda, rest well. I'll be here with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He now feels incredibly content as he is with his beloved wife and their newborn daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he knew that all this satisfaction was given by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gave him warmth and happiness, and he will spend the rest of his life loving and protecting her, making her very happy... very happy...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace and Lina went to the hospital to visit Valda and her newborn baby, and of course, they also brought gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After seeing all the gifts, Valda couldn't help but say, "You guys brought too much stuff. Kyla and Amber brought a lot yesterday too. I don't know when I'll be able to use it all for the baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This batch can't be used up, it can be saved for the next one," Lina joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace said, "We couldn't decide what to give, so we just bought everything. Have you picked a name for the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda replied, "Her name is Harley Hart. I hope she can be safe and warm like summer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nice name," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But why hasn't the baby opened her eyes yet?" Lina walked to the baby's bed and stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The baby was moving around and sucking her fingers, but her eyes remained closed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She hasn't opened her eyes since birth. Brian said she'll open them in a few days. He was like that when he was a baby," Valda explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wonder whose eyes she has. Her eyelashes are long, so her eyes should be big," Lina commented, then couldn't resist picking up the cute baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her own daughter was already in kindergarten, so Lina's maternal instincts were strong for newborn babies. If it weren't for the fact that newborns aren't suitable for adults to kiss, Lina would probably not be able to resist giving the baby a few kisses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's so cute, I wish I could have another one," Lina exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let it go, you scared your spouse half to death when you gave birth to one," Grace said.</p></div>
