        <h1>Chapter 1928</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She even chose to give up her life for him. The woman loved him with her life! Fortunately, it was not too late for him to know that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His heart that had been uneasy and suspicious before was unprecedentedly calm now because he knew that the woman he loved loved him back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Jason were still in the hospital ward when Lina was discharged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could be discharged too, but since Jason still needed to be hospitalized for a while, Grace stayed in the hospital to take care of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although Terrence had arranged professional caretakers, Grace preferred to take care of Jason herself, so she cooperated with the caretakers to do whatever she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina came to Grace and told her she was going to J City to find Hadwin Stephenson, Grace showed a look of understanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, after hearing what Katherine Jackson had said, she knew how much Hadwin Stephenson loved her best friend. It would be a lifelong regret if Lina missed a man like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, Lina was now pregnant with Hadwin Stephenson's baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"When are you going to J City?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We're leaving tomorrow. My parents are afraid that it would be inconvenient for me to go to J City alone since I'm pregnant, so they plan to accompany me there," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I wonder if you&rsquo;re the first woman to go after her man with her parents and baby," quipped Grace, wanting to relieve the gloom on her best friend&rsquo;s face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina sighed. "I only hope Hadwin can forgive me. It was such a huge misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He will. If he loves you, he&rsquo;ll forgive you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was not as optimistic about it. It was exactly because Hadwin loved her that he would be extremely disappointed after she hurt him like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Could she resurrect a disappointed heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was going to see Hadwin no matter what. There was so much she wanted to say to him. She wanted to fight for her happiness!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "Alright, I gotta go. Grace, thank you. Without you, my baby and I wouldn't have survived. I'm happy to see you and Jason alive and reconciled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It&rsquo;ll be the same for you and Hadwin Stephenson," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After Lina left, Grace returned to the ward and told Jason about it. "Lina seems worried that Hadwin Stephenson won't forgive her. She feels that she has deeply hurt Hadwin Stephenson. What happened between them was a misunderstanding. Perhaps things would have been better if both of them had figured out what truly happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now, she was only glad that Lina did not choose to abort the baby in her belly back then. If she had chosen to go with the abortion, Lina would only be more devastated after finding out the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson will surely forgive Lina," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you really think so?" Grace asked quickly. Although she had comforted Lina with the same words, she was still a little unsure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"When one loves another deeply, they don&rsquo;t mean it when they say they won&rsquo;t forgive their partners,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just like when she betrayed him. He was furious with her, but he could not get over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The moment he knew she might be in danger, he was at a loss and shivered. It felt as if everything in the world was turning gray.</p></div>
