        <h1>Chapter 1063</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had left the door unlocked, but... she knew that when he said he would keep her here, then there was no way she could get out of the house even if she did manage to step out the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door was pushed open. Jason walked in with a pile of clothes in his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're up?" he asked, looking at Grace who was sitting on the bed. She was wrapped in the sheets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip and glared at him in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He shrugged it off and walked up to her, saying, "Here's your change of clothes. Let me help you put them on to see if they fit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly rejected him. "No! I can put them on myself!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright. You can put them on yourself." He did not insist and laid the clothes by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him. 'He's still here. How am I supposed to dress myself?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to see her hesitation. "Didn't you change your clothes in front of me when we lived together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You used to be my boyfriend and my lover, but not anymore," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression changed slightly. Then, he slowly closed his eyes. "Alright, I won't look. You can change."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, not expecting him to close his eyes like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing so still with his eyes closed, he looked like a perfect statue. His thick black fan-like eyelashes cast shadows over his eyelids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip and eventually started changing her clothes quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, though his eyes were closed and she knew that he could see nothing, her cheeks still blushed when she was done changing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... I'm done," she said after some hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he slowly opened his eyes. Those beautiful peach blossom eyes looked at her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you blushing because of me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips together and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He bent down a little, his face getting closer to hers. He asked, "You still have feelings for me, don't you?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned her head away and denied it. "No! If it were any other man, I... would blush too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face immediately darkened, and just when Grace thought he would be irritated, he bent down to pick up a pair of socks that were lying nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had changed her clothes, but she had not put her socks on yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sat on the edge of the bed while he knelt in front of her. He held her foot and carefully put on the sock for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once he was done with one sock, he put the other sock on her other foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened. Seeing the way Jason was behaving now, she had an indescribable feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, can't you let me go?" she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was still kneeling when he slightly raised his chin to look at her. "What about you? Can't you fall in love with me again?"</p></div>
