        <h1>Chapter 2983</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was focused on the program.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I saw my boyfriend on TV and had a strange feeling, like he was both far away and close at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the host finished asking Brian about work-related matters, the topic changed. "By the way, there have been some photos and videos circulating online today. The people in these photos and videos look a lot like Mr. Hart. Many netizens have divided into two camps, one camp thinks that the person is you, Mr. Hart, while the other camp thinks it's not. We are also curious, so we want to ask Mr. Hart to confirm whether the person in these photos is really you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the host spoke these words, one of the photos from online was also displayed on the screen behind Brian and the host.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The photo shows Brian and Valda sitting on the waiting chairs outside a crayfish restaurant, waiting for their turn to be called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt both relieved and sweaty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, the host didn't show any photos or videos related to fighting or the police station. Instead, they only showed pictures of waiting outside the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And the reason she was sweating profusely was that although her face was blurred by the production team, her body was not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had known she was going to be on TV, she should have dressed better that day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wait, what is she thinking? Valda quickly pushes aside her own wandering thoughts and nervously watches the TV screen, wondering what Brian will say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, he simply and straightforwardly said two words, "It's me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The host seemed surprised by Brian's quick admission and was momentarily stunned. After a while, the host regained composure and asked, "So, Mr. Hart, are you admitting that you are the person in the photo?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to deny?" Brian seemed to find the question ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, the woman who was sitting next to you at that time was..." The host hesitated to speak, and Valda could feel the burning curiosity in his eyes, even through the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's my girlfriend," Brian said with a slight smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The host's expression showed genuine surprise, rather than a fake one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is she your girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Right," said Brian. "I don't want my relationship with her to disrupt my girlfriend's normal life, so I also hope that everyone won't bother her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said this not only to the production team, but also to other media outlets and many journalists in this industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The prince of the entertainment industry has spoken. Anyone who lives in this industry would be afraid to make the same mistake again, as no one wants to retire early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So... how did you and your girlfriend meet?" The host forced a smile and finally resumed the behavior expected of a host. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was a rainy day and I forgot my umbrella. My girlfriend kindly offered me hers to shield me from the rain," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The host said, "How romantic! I bet many women watching right now are dreaming of being the one to hand Mr. Hart his umbrella."</p></div>
