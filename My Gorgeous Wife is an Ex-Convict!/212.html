        <h1>Chapter 211</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt like one of the ironies of life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not speak a word but went over to the drawer. She took out the pair of gloves and handed them to him. "Here are your gloves, as agreed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He studied the gloves carefully and tried them on. "They're quite good and warm, just like the scarf you knitted, Sis. It's also warm and comfortable to wear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to wear it. Others will look at it and feel it doesn't suit you," she said. His fine clothes only made the scarf look old, cheap, and rough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Doesn't suit me?" He raised his eyebrows and chuckled. "Sis, to me, there's never the need for others to judge whether it suits me or not. It only matters if I feel good about it. Take this scarf for an instance. When I say it suits me, then it suits me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He then paused before feeling the scarf again. "What's more, Sis is the one who knitted it. In that case... it will suit any kind of clothes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart suddenly began beating violently. This was the kind of remark that if uttered by someone else, would only seem ridiculous, but when he said it, it seemed to be a fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His handsome face was full of earnestness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if this scarf she knitted was a priceless treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Sis..." He took off the gloves he was trying on and randomly pulled a chair over to sit on. He smiled at her and said, "I never liked the same things as anyone else. Now that Sis has knitted a scarf and a pair of gloves for me, you can no longer knit these things for anyone else, understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His smile looked so clean and clear, just like the sunshine in the early morning. People could not help but love such a smile. However, his words made her heart ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was that a warning?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was warning her not to knit scarves and gloves for anyone in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many in Emerald City dared to disobey his warning?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">-</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day as an extra, Grace waited at the venue according to the appointed time in the group. However, Claire did not join them this time. Grace also did not see any acquaintances among those who signed up as extras.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the time came, the organizer checked their names and brought everyone over to the film crew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today's filming location was just nearby in a rented mansion. It was still early, but crowds of fans had gathered outside with some fans holding signs with their idols' names on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace saw Lily's name, she felt a clunk in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily was going to be in today's film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The organizer had issued the play's title that day, and she was planning to check it out. However, she forgot about it because of Jason&rsquo;s arrival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a little regretful for not checking on the relevant details about the film that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was only there as an extra today. She would not cross paths with Lily, so there might not be any trouble.</p></div>
