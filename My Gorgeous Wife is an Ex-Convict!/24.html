        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But I... I made you lose face in front of everyone, and even Greg..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's what they did. It had nothing to do with you, right?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It had something to do with me!" Mia shouted in her heart. This was the first time in her life that she desperately wanted to take responsibility for something. But the words wouldn&rsquo;t come.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well, if there is nothing else, I still have to work,&rdquo; Grace said, ignoring the bitter look on Mia's face. She went around Mia and walked to the other side of the road to sweep the ground.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Grace did not know why Mia had come to her today, she did not intend to forgive her for what had happened that day.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as Grace was sweeping, a figure suddenly appeared in front of her. She looked up to see that it was Chase from the fleet.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chase&rsquo;s face was slightly red, and he said with great courage, "Grace, Claire said that you don't want to be in love now, but... but... I'm sincere. I'm willing to wait for you. When... when you do want to be in a relationship, you can look for me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying this, he seemed to feel that something was amiss. He quickly corrected himself and said, "It's not that you can look for me, but that I can line up and wait for you..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace stared at him in a daze. "You can find someone more suitable for you. I am just a street sweeper. I don't earn much, and my job has no future. I am not good wife material."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But I like you." After saying this, Chase's face seemed to turn redder. "Claire said that you don't have a boyfriend now. I will wait."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But I..." She just wanted to refuse again, but when she saw his flushed face and somewhat nervous expression, she was a little stunned. At least this man, at this moment, seemed to be sincere to her, and as Claire had told her, he was an honest person.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Such a man, generally speaking, would be a good husband and a good father.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But... if this man knew that she had been in prison, he would probably stay far away from her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded behind her. "Sister, won't you introduce us?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace turned around and saw a familiar figure walking towards her. The black down jacket, black trousers, and sneakers were all from discount stores, but on him, they looked stylishly good. However, his expression was a bit more, she wasn&rsquo;t sure, but predatory came to mind. He didn&rsquo;t outwardly reflect any anger, but something told Grace that Jason wasn&rsquo;t nearly as calm as he appeared.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&rdquo;Of course,&rdquo; she replied automatically. &ldquo;This is my colleague. Jay, why are you here?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I finished work early today, so I came to see you," Jason said as he held Grace's left hand, he rubbed his palms over hers. &ldquo;Your hand is a little cold."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's okay." Working in the chilly winter, her hands would be blown by the harsh wind. Obviously, they would get cold, but she was used to it. She didn&rsquo;t wear gloves most of the time because they made it harder to work.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Jason held her hands with both of his, warming them up gently. He rubbed them with one hand and then changed over to the other.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chase stared at the intimate interaction between Jason and Grace, his frown deepening. He could not help but ask, &ldquo;Grace, is this... your brother?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes." Grace nodded.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason glanced at Chase and lazily put his hands around her waist. &ldquo;When do you finish work?&rdquo; he asked her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In half an hour. I'll be done after sweeping this road," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright." Jason smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced at Chase. &ldquo;You should let her finish,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have a good day.&rdquo;</p></div>
