        <h1>Chapter 2475</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her father only said coldly, "Sick people always say they're not sick. You're mentally ill!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The statement seemed to have knocked her to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had always known that her father did not love her and even hated her, but she never expected someone to be so wicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Mr. Mitchell saw Amber Mitchell walk over, he immediately assumed a fatherly demeanor. "Amby, you finally came out. I was just about to go in to get you. You've finally recovered. All those years of treatment didn't go to waste. Come on, let's go home. While you were away all these years, your mom had your room cleaned every day, expecting you to come home as soon as possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My mom?" Amber Mitchell sneered. "My mom died when I was three years old. Did my mom come back from the dead?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The statement immediately made the atmosphere awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on Mr. Xia's face froze as well. In the past, he would have slapped her. However, with so many reporters in front of him, he had to finish the show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your biological mother died when you were three years old. Your stepmother isn't your biological mother, but she treats you like her own daughter. She&rsquo;s always been worried about you in the past few years. She often cries at home.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Mitchell rushed forward with red eyes and said, "Amby, you've suffered so much. I'll treat you better from now on. From the day I married into the Mitchell family, I've thought of you as my own daughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on Amber Mitchell's face became increasingly sarcastic. "So, you want to steal my mom's fortune, husband, and even daughter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Xia's expression froze as her face paled and reddened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on Mr. Xia's face finally gave way. "What are you talking about? Should you say that to someone who has worked so hard to raise you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Mitchell also looked down and sobbed as if she had been wronged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It now seemed like the Mitchell family was innocent while Amber Mitchell was the guilty one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reporters were filming this scene with their cameras.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was secretly smug. She had expected Amber Mitchell to react this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Public opinion online would probably change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could you think that way, Sis? In fact... Mommy and Daddy have been in love since way back then, but they separated because of an incident. When Mommy found Daddy, she saw that he already had his own family, so she kept her feelings to herself and didn't bother you until your mom died. Mommy was sorry that you lost your mother at such a young age, so she wanted to love you as much as your own mother loved you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's speech was an apparent response to online comments that said Mrs. Mitchell was a homewrecker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? I don't know how much of her feelings she kept to herself, though. If that was truly the case, she wouldn&rsquo;t have had an affair and slept with Dad when he was still married. Otherwise, we wouldn&rsquo;t have a two-year age gap,&rdquo; retorted Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's expression changed slightly, but she remained calm. "Sis, we're a family no matter what. We're here to take you home. Our family has suffered a lot for you these years. The doctor said you didn't know what you were doing whenever you lost control, Sis. You have a lot of misunderstandings about us. I'll explain them to you one by one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell went forward to help Amber Mitchell as she spoke, but the bodyguards beside Amber Mitchell stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell grumbled, "Sis, would you rather trust outsiders than your own family? Or... is someone trying to use you to go against the Mitchell family?"</p></div>
