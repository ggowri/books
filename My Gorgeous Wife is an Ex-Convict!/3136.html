        <h1>Chapter 3134</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... there will still be normal people walking, with some subtle differences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as someone takes a closer look, they can easily see it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt many people's eyes on her, some filled with doubt, surprise, or even mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A natural urge to escape rises in her heart, but she knows she must face it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she can't face it now, how can she stay by Brian's side in the long years to come?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, she will only face more challenges.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone approached and greeted Brian, then their gaze fell on Valda. "And who is this?" they asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She is my fianc&eacute;e," Brian introduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the words "fianc&eacute;e" were spoken, not only did the person's face show a surprised expression, but even Valda looked astonished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She originally thought he would say "girlfriend", but she didn't expect him to jump straight to the level of "fianc&eacute;e".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... I hope to be able to drink to your wedding soon." The other person took a while to recover before speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will." Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon after, many people at the venue came to know that the woman accompanying Brian today was his fianc&eacute;e.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Crown Prince has a fianc&eacute;e now, which is not that surprising to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, in the past year, there have been rumors that the Crown Prince had a girlfriend who went missing. The Crown Prince went crazy looking for her, and it took a toll on him. He even forbade anyone from mentioning her name in front of him, let alone speak ill of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wrapped a piece of torn cloth around his own wrist, simply because it was a fragment of clothing from his girlfriend's outfit when she went missing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In tMason Swansonrcle, there have been rumors that the prince has deep feelings for his girlfriend. It is said that once she returns, she will become the future Mrs. Hart and hold a prominent position in the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, because this woman disappeared, many women who had designs on Brian began to have hope. As long as that woman never returned, they naturally had a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unexpectedly, the prince brought his fianc&eacute;e out today, which surprised everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this the unmarried fianc&eacute;e that the Crown Prince has been desperately searching for?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she has a decent appearance, it's important to remember that the entertainment industry is filled with beautiful women. How many women are there who are more beautiful than her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And as some insiders know, the Crown Prince's fianc&eacute;e is not a socialite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, women like her should be plentiful, so it's unclear what the prince sees in her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's legs aren't suitable for standing for long periods, so after Brian greeted some acquaintances, he found a spot for Valda to sit and rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go get you some food, wait for me here," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Brian left, Valda took out her phone and started scrolling through the messages on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a voice suddenly spoke softly in her ear, "Excuse me, are you Brian's fianc&eacute;e?"</p></div>
