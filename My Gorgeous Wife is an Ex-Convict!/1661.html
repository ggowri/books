        <h1>Chapter 1659</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He longed deeply for that woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could have any woman he wanted, but... she had no idea she was the only one he wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because she was the only one he loved. How could he want another woman when he was only capable of giving her all his affection?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His dumping her back then had been a stop-gap measure. He did it without thinking of the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because he had no idea whether he had one or whether he could reclaim the Stephenson family and bring down the Jackson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was walking on eggshells at that time. He could not even promise her in secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For five years, he had secretly kept an eye on her. He knew whatever was going on with her but dared not appear in front of her. All he could do was to endure it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he had now gotten all he wanted but she no longer had feelings for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson could not help laughing bitterly at himself at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was funny. He had done everything for her, but it was all for nothing. Perhaps the fact that she was still alive was already the greatest blessing he would ever receive. What more could he ask for?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stayed quietly in the car. He was still looking in that direction even when Lina's figure had long disappeared from his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sometime later, his phone rang and he answered the call. "Mr. Stephenson, Miss Jackson left Emerald City today. We've also talked to the media here. No one from the media will bother Miss Sweeney again from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, keep an eye on the Jackson family and observe who's going to help them," Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," the subordinate answered and ended the conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson put the phone away. 'The Jackson family...' Even if he could give the Jackson family a way out as he had promised, he was only making them boiling frogs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would make sure the Jackson family went down the path of destruction!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Time slowly went by. Hadwin Stephenson had no idea how long he had stayed outside her neighborhood. However, Hadwin Stephenson's eyes suddenly turned cold when another car drove inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That's... Anthony Sherman's car!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had seen the car before and remembered the car&rsquo;s number plate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Anthony Sherman has come to see Lina! That man and Lina...' When he thought of her and Anthony Sherman together, a surge of jealousy filled his chest, almost suffocating him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson opened the door and got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Step by step, he walked into the neighborhood and came to Lina's apartment building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had been here many times. He had gone to her house to chat with her parents and have dinner together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That time, he had felt the warmth of an ordinary family for the first time. Though they were not that well off, the family was happy. One did not have to plot against each other, let alone observe others and speculate what was going on in their heads. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Has Anthony Sherman taken my place?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That man would replace him. He would be with Lina and even marry her and start a family with her...</p></div>
