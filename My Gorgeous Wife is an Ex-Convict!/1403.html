        <h1>Chapter 1402</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Otherwise, he and she would be consigned to eternal damnation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Martin Weiss left the ward, the three members of the Daniels family almost collapsed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Daniels said in a panic, "What should we do? What should we do? If Martin finds out the one who donated the bone marrow was..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mom!" Paisley Daniels immediately stopped her and said, "There's nothing to do. I was the one who donated Martin the bone marrow! It's right there in the hospital records! So what if they have some phone recording? It's been so long. Anyone can fake it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was almost as if Paisley Daniels was trying to convince herself with her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The evidence she had tampered with pointed to her as the one who donated the bone marrow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn had no evidence at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Daniels seemed to suddenly come to her senses and said, "Yes, yes, it was you! You were the one who donated Martin the bone marrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Daniels's face seemed extremely grim right now. He naturally knew that Martin Weiss would not believe that woman's one-sided statement, but he did not believe them either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With Martin Weiss's character, he would investigate this. "Paisley, will Shane Currey really go abroad after taking the money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's what he told me." The thought of Shane Currey made her teeth ache with hate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If Shane Currey had not made her drunk on purpose, how could she have gotten pregnant with his baby? She even intentionally aborted the baby to conceal the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The chances of her getting pregnant were slim. She would not have anything to worry about if the baby had been Martin's!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Anyway, keep an eye on Shane Currey and tell him to go abroad as soon as possible!" said Mr. Daniels. Shane Currey was like a time bomb as long as he stayed in the country. No one knew when it would explode.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well... Will there be any problem with... Paisley and Martin's wedding?" Mrs. Daniels asked anxiously. After all, the Daniels family had always been dependent on the Weiss family to steady their footing and get into high society.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If the marriage fell through, it would not only concern their daughter but the entire Daniels family would become tMason Swansonty's laughing stock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"In this case, make it a fact. We&rsquo;ll leave Martin with no choice but to marry Paisley even though he's doubtful!" said Mr. Daniels after pondering for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Daniels family must remain unconquerable! Even if Martin Weiss found out the truth about the bone marrow donation, he would leave Martin Weiss with no choice but to marry Paisley!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn fainted because of the pain. Fortunately, she was in the hospital and the doctor treated her in time. Kyla Corbyn now lay in a hospital bed, still unconscious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn had the drip attached to the back of her hand. The injuries on her forehead and knees had also been treated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the way Kyla Corbyn looked now, Grace's eyes turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The scene of Kyla being forced to kneel and grovel reminded her of how someone had once forcibly pulled out her fingernails one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew the pain of being powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In particular, Martin Weiss, whom Kyla had once loved and saved, was among the people who made her kneel and grovel!</p></div>
