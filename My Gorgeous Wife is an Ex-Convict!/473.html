        <h1>Chapter 472</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace had not expected Jason to ask his driver to bring his personal car which only cost around 300 thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you say you wanted it to be a little more normal?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want it to be normal because I don't want to stand out in the town. It's a small town so all kinds of gossip would probably arise. I'm afraid such things would bother Grandma. But are you really going to drive this car?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did I just say all of that for fun?" Jason smiled. "All right, get in the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when Grace got into the car that she discovered that the driver was not coming this time and that Jason would be the one driving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're driving?" She asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. It's not that far anyway. Just take a nap if you're sleepy. I know the way there," Jason said as he started the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace unconsciously pressed her lips together as she watched Jason drive. It would take more than two hours for the car to reach the town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be tiring for Jason to drive for more than two hours. However, Grace could not give him a hand because her driving license had been suspended and... she could never drive anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a lifetime ban from driving!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless... if she were one day able to reverse her case and clear her name, she would then be able to get back everything she had lost. That included her driver's license, bar qualification, as well as other&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, there were some things she would never get back, such as... her enthusiasm, innocence, ambition, beautiful thoughts about the world, affection that she thought was warm... and days of youth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was 28 years old now. Although she had not yet turned 30, most of the time, she felt as if her heart was already that old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had not met Jason, there was a chance that she would really be dying like an elderly lady, living with an old heart until she grew old and passed away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nonetheless, because of Jason, her old heart seemed to be getting more and more lively, and she began having some hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At one point in time, Grace thought that the most painful thing that had happened to her after being released from prison was meeting Jason and being deceived by him. However, in truth... it was part of her luck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was he who made her feel that life was getting better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... great that he had fallen in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace slowly closed her eyes and fell asleep as she thought about it. By the time she woke up, the car had reached the town, and they were approaching her grandmother's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace rubbed her eyes and said with some embarrassment, "I... fell asleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you slept soundly and even grinded your teeth in your sleep," Jason added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately felt embarrassed as her cheeks reddened. Really? Had she grinded her teeth when she was asleep? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just kidding. All right, we'll reach your grandmother's house in a few minutes," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thus, Grace fixed her hair and clothes. When Jason pulled over at her grandmother's house, he grabbed Grace by the hand just as she was about to get out.</p></div>
