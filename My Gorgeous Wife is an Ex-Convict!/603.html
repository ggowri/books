        <h1>Chapter 602</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why... Did she have to spell the answer out?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he now looked as if he wanted her to answer him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me. Why? Tell me why you won't fall for Brian." He was pressing her for an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help blushing, but she still said it out loud, "Because you're the one I've fallen for. There's really nothing between me and Brian, Jay. I don't want you to misunderstand me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was there really nothing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes became darker and darker. The photos of Brian holding her in his arms that were in his email inbox seemed to appear in front of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even... The photo of Brian crying in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those photos seemed to mock him in silence. Despite all his efforts, he still could not break the bond between her and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing? Have you nothing to hide from me?" he asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've made everything clear between me and Brian." She thought he was asking about the incident today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well then... Grace, how crazy are you about me?" His breath sprayed over her face, and his lips almost clung to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ambiguity was made all the more apparent by the confined space in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face went a little redder. How... How was she going to answer that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't want me to suffer pain and sorrow?" he asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed and nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you miss me terribly when you don't see me?" he continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She continued nodding her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then&hellip; Do you desire me? Do you have a desire to have me?" His voice was like the sweetest of chords, engaging in the most moving seduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only feel the blood rushing to her brain. Her face was burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Desire... Did she desire him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His looks, his voice, his breath, and even the gentle touch of his fingers could easily tease her. It made her irresistibly attracted to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to be with him, to grow old with him, and to have children together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she desired him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blushed, nodded, and uttered softly, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took a lot of courage for her to give such an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were fixed on her. Suddenly, he raised his hand and tore the tie from around his neck. His slender fingers unfastened two buttons at the neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His aura seemed to change. It was full of danger. "Then, prove it to me." His thin lips opened slowly, his deep voice floating in the air.</p></div>
