        <h1>Chapter 2471</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell had been on pins and needles these two days. Amber Mitchell's consultation was coming soon. Today, she learned that George had gone to the hospital to see Amber Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why on earth did he go to see Amber Mitchell? Does he still have feelings for Amber Mitchell?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment Amber Mitchell was not diagnosed with mental illness, all the blame would inevitably be directed at the Mitchell family. The Mitchell family must firmly hold onto the Gregory family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Louise Mitchell took a deep breath and walked up to George Gregory. "George, I had a video call with Simon today. He's having a great time with his grandparents!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" George Gregory asked nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell tugged at the neckline of her nightgown and approached the man in front of her with a seductive gesture. "Simon is already seven years old and will be a young adult in a few years. He even asked me in the video call today when I&rsquo;ll be giving him a younger brother or sister. He seems to want to be a big brother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said lightly, "Kids always do things on the spur of the moment. He was probably just saying that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell said softly, "But I really want to make him a big brother. George, let's have another baby. This house is too c<span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>old and cheerless with only Simon. Besides, our parents keep urging us to have another child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if her body could not conceive a baby, she could find a surrogate to do it for her. However, he had to touch her first. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all these years of marriage, he had never touched her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a while, she even wondered if he was incapable. After marrying him, she almost lived like a widow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even her in-laws had forced him to go for a physical examination, but the result of the physical examination showed that everything was normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would say indifferently that she could divorce him at any time if she did not want to accept a marriage like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... how could she be content with a divorce?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had gone to so much trouble to become his wife. Besides, she truly loved him. How could she be willing to accept a divorce?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would be the laughing stock of Deer City if they really did get a divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Louise Mitchell became more audacious, and her facial expressions became more seductive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted him to touch her no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want Amber Mitchell's child to inherit the Gregory family. Every time she saw that child, she would think of Amber Mitchell and wish she could strangle him to death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to have another child to further consolidate her status in the Gregory family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she seemed to want to prove that George Gregory was not devoid of feelings for her after spending so many years together. How could she not be a match for Amber Mitchell?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell grabbed George Gregory's face and kissed him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To her surprise, George Gregory did not refuse and accepted her kiss. He also put his hand around her waist as though he was accepting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was delighted and kissed harder. She did not notice the indifference in George Gregory's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the woman in his arms was trying to please him, his body seemed frigid and did not respond. Even when she kissed him, Amber Mitchell's face flashed across his mind.</p></div>
