        <h1>Chapter 3194</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she opened the content, she saw some photos taken by onlookers. The photos looked like scenes from a drama, quite similar to idol dramas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Should I compress the news for you?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda paused for a moment and shook her head, saying "No need, let's just go with the flow." Then, she also took a screenshot of a trending topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian raised his eyebrows and asked, "Why did you take a screenshot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's show these photos to our children in the future!" She said with a smile, "We can tell them that their mommy and daddy took these wedding photos and even became trending topics. Most people don't even get to experience that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian laughed. He had been worried about trending and how it might affect her mood, but it turned out to be unnecessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Valda finished taking screenshots, she continued scrolling through the comments below. Some comments were full of blessings, while others were cursing Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What are they saying about the Crown Prince marrying such a worthless woman? Some are even questioning how he could be so blind. Others are predicting that even if they do get married, they will eventually get divorced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Others have suggested that the prince was likely just temporarily confused and will come to his senses soon, which would mean there won't be a wedding after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda scrolled through the screen with her finger, reading through each comment, whether positive or negative.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian, who was sitting next to her, naturally watched with her. However, he didn't watch for long before frowning and saying to Valda, "Stop watching."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked up at his stern face and asked, "Are you unhappy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I would be happy to see those online comments that are insulting you?" he said. "I will immediately have someone delete those comments and push down the trending topic!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said it and then reached for his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hurriedly held onto his hand and said, "No, this will only make us look guilty. Besides, I'm not like the currency that everyone loves. It's their business if they have something to say. In the future, our love and happiness will be the best way to prove them wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is now more open-minded towards negative comments and criticisms about her attacks that she used to take poorly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To stand by Brian's side, you must make yourself stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There's nothing much to say, but also, I saw in the comments that many people are saying you're handsome, with no flaws from any angle, and some are even saying that if you were to act in an idol drama, it would definitely be a hit! Valda changed the subject and talked about some interesting comments, "And just now, I saw someone use your profile picture and edited it into a historical costume, it looks really good. I think your historical costume style has a unique charm. How about we take a set of immortal and martial arts style photos for our wedding photoshoot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can do whatever you want, it's fine with me," said Brian. He didn't have any objections, as long as Valda was happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Regardless of whether you're filming a modern drama or a historical drama, it will definitely be very beautiful. I really want to see how you perform in a TV drama," she murmured as she gently stroked his eyebrows and eyes with her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, how about I go make a TV drama?" he suggested. After all, if he wanted to make a TV drama, it would be a piece of cake for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The prince wants to make a drama, but he's afraid that there will be too many cast members coming to audition for roles.</p></div>
