        <h1>Chapter 2394</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse did it out of habit and did not think much about it. After all, Louise Mitchell had asked her to do that to Amber Mitchell many times when she was here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As time passed, the nurses stopped treating Amber Mitchell like a human being and sometimes took their anger out on her when they were in a bad mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory's expression froze and his brows furrowed when he watched the nurse hit Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had nothing but hatred for the woman now, he did not want to see someone else beat her like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough!" George Gregory raised his left hand and violently pushed the nurse away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse staggered as she was pushed aside. She said with shock, "Mr. Gregory!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory ignored her. He just stared at the person biting his right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand was bleeding from the bite, and red blood ran down her mouth as it dripped onto the white bedsheet. George Gregory finally saw the eyes covered by the frizzy hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Her eyes...' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's eyes were not as bright as they used to be. Those eyes seemed like they had experienced many things in life and... were full of intense hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She hates me! That's overwhelming hatred!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But why does she hate me so much? She wronged me back then. I should be the one who should be resentful! I hate her. She has no right to hate me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell, you're really a lunatic! Haven't you gotten better after all these years of treatment here?" He snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her pupils shrank, and her hatred was suddenly enveloped by silence as if everything was still. Slowly, she closed her eyes and loosened her bite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory finally got to withdraw his hand. There were red teeth marks on it, and blood was oozing from the wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell hung her head low and was motionless as when he first came in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse saw George Gregory's bleeding hand and hurriedly said, "Mr. Gregory, you should have your hand taken care of quickly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she yelled at Amber Mitchell, "Great, you bit someone again! Who told you to bite others?" With that said, she raised one hand to hit her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said, "Who permitted you to hit her? You're just the nurse. You're in charge of taking care of her, not beating her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory, you don't know this, but the doctor told us to hit the patients if they&rsquo;re aggressive. They&rsquo;ll feel pain and learn their lesson after getting beaten," the nurse said plausibly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, do you beat her a lot?" George Gregory's face darkened as he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse noticed George Gregory's angry tone and immediately said weakly, "We... uh... only hit her when she's aggressive. It's for her own good! Besides... uh... it's what the doctor ordered." She hurriedly removed herself from all responsibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't beat her up anymore. Don't forget, she's still the heiress of the Mitchell family!" George Gregory said coldly. He took another look at Amber Mitchell and almost left the ward in a fluster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he could no longer stay there. The person he once loved was now a complete lunatic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When George Gregory got back into the car, he leaned back in the seat with his face full of exhaustion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Amber Mitchell... Amber Mitchell... '</p></div>
