        <h1>Chapter 1479</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Master Reed is just trying to better protect you, Young Madam," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is he protecting me or monitoring me?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence instantly fell silent. After all, Master Reed had given orders not to tell Grace about Secretary Wang lest she got worried, especially now that she was about to give birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did not go on either. She just lowered her head, her eyes resting on her bulging belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once she got to the hospital, Grace met Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina seemed to be in good spirits in the ward. She could now take care of herself. Once she was discharged and took a little more rest, she could live her life like before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina greeted Grace. "Grace, you came! Come, come. Quickly sit down. You're a pregnant woman, and this is an important period."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Grace sat down, she asked, "How are you? Did the doctor say when you can be discharged?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I can be discharged next week." Lina grinned and touched her bald head. As she had surgery on her head, her hair was all shaved off and she would probably have to wear a wig for some time after getting discharged. "Kyla came to see me yesterday and said she has been discharged. I guess one can say that she had a narrow escape from death this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Fortunately, you and Kyla are safe this time," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, I got really lucky when you think about it." Lina sighed and said, "By the way, it's really surprising that the real perpetrator in your case was Lily. We all thought the real perpetrator was Dexter Rios, but who knew Lily even fooled Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"She didn't," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Huh?" Lina was a little confused for a moment. "What do you mean she didn't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a moment of silence, Grace said somewhat bitterly, "He knew it was Lily from the start."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina gasped with shock in her eyes. 'How... How can this be? If Jason knew who the real perpetrator was from the start, doesn't that...' Lina was a little afraid to think further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"At the time, he knew who did it and just chose to look on without doing anything," said Grace. She looked at her best friend with a wry smile. "Lina, didn't you want to go to Jason and tell him that I was being wronged back then? But in fact... he already knew about it. So even if you had met him and told him about it, the outcome would still be the same."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina saw her best friend's expression and felt sad. She knew how deep Grace's feelings for Jason were. She thought her best friend had already gotten her happy ending, but who would have thought this would happen?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then... what are you going to do now?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't know. I just can't face him for the time being. Maybe some things need time to settle and fade away," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said, "Whatever decision you make, I'm on your side! But Grace, it's not easy for two people to be together. It wasn't easy for you and Jason to get married and have children. I can see that Jason really loves you. It's rare for someone like him to love someone like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Lina saw her best friend's silence, she quickly said again, "I'm on your side! I know how much you suffered in prison! I just... I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina&rsquo;s voice became a little nasally, and she sobbed as she spoke, "I just think... it's not easy to be with someone you love, so... don't separate so easily. Take Hadwin Stephenson and me as an example. I thought we were very much in love, but we broke up so easily."</p></div>
