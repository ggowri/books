        <h1>Chapter 2178</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My wife, our two children, and I are planning to go to Deer City soon and visit you. You're not going to say no, are you?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow was silent for a while. "I don't want my son to return to Emerald City before he even gets familiar with Deer City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't worry. Since he's a member of the Barlow family, he should stay in Deer City, of course. I&rsquo;ll just be bringing the children there to visit him. Nothing will change," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then Philip Barlow said, "Okay, come over anytime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two men ended the call after setting a date.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow came out of the study, looked at the time, and went to the piano room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew that his son should be practicing in the piano room at this hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His son's piano talent was even better than he had expected. Even a famous pianist in Deer City whom he had found for his son had said that he had great talent after listening to his son's performance. Although he was a little weak at emotional expression, he was still young, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, his mastery of piano skills was far beyond his peers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If it were not for the fact that his son was the sole heir to the Barlow family, Philip Barlow would focus on nurturing his son's piano talent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... what the Barlow family wanted was someone who could inherit the Barlow family and lead the Barlow family to greatness in the business world&mdash;not a pianist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could let his son play piano for a few more years, though. After all... he could treat it as a hobby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow gently pushed the door to the piano room open and saw William's small body sitting in front of the piano. He was playing a tune with a blank expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, compared to his expression, the tune was a cheerful one. Philip Barlow was amazed by how his fingers moved on the piano keys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wondered what kind of expression William would show if he heard that Jasper was coming to visit him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was probably willing to leave the Reed family only because Jasper had hurt him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jasper was coming over now. He wanted to see how important she was to William. It would not be a good thing if she was too important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">During the weekend, Jason and Grace took Mick Reed and Jasper to Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It took two hours by plane to arrive at Deer City's airport. It was almost noon when they arrived in Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper was full of anxiety during the entire trip. She was hoping to see William as soon as possible. She had even written an apology card, on which she wrote many things to express how sorry she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She must apologize properly and ask William whether he wanted to return to the Reed family&rsquo;s house with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She would be very nice to him and would never misunderstand him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason and Philip Barlow did not meet up at the Barlow family's residence but the most luxurious restaurant in Deer City that was owned by the Barlow family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Jason and the rest arrived, someone immediately came up to them and said, "You must be Mr. Reed and Mrs. Reed. Mr. Barlow asked me to wait here for you. Please come with me."</p></div>
