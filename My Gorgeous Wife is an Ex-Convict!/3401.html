        <h1>Chapter 3399</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Lornell was lost in thought, Harley struggled to stand on her tiptoes and pulled on his shirt collar so hard that he involuntarily bent over slightly. Her lips landed on his cheek, giving him a loud and resounding kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lornell, I will like you from now on, okay?" the little one said with bright, shining eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell stared at the little face in front of him, feeling that her smile was so bright and beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley, huh... If she likes him, does he have to like her back?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Do you like this little guy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it were the him from before, he would definitely have scoffed and thought it was impossible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he is somewhat uncertain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Valda, who was standing nearby, watched the scene unfold. She saw the red ink on her daughter's hand smearing onto Lornell's body and immediately wanted to step forward to pull the child away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian, however, held her hand and whispered, "No need."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" Valda looked surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's see how the two children get along. Since Lornell didn't push Harley away, maybe this engagement isn't too bad after all," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although his daughter was holding onto the other person, it made him feel uneasy, as if the cabbage he had worked hard to grow had only just sprouted and was about to be eaten by someone else's pig.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to be honest, Lornell is a suitable match for Harley in terms of appearance and family background. What's more important is that Lornell was the one who actively requested the Quentin family to save Harley, and even offered to use a marriage proposal to persuade them to help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just on this point, Lornell is already a benefactor of the Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, his liking for Lornell naturally increased a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the age of 3 and 7, there are still many years ahead before they can know if these two children will be able to walk together in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, what they need to do is to make sure these two children get along as well as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Quentin family left with the marriage certificate, and Lornell is also returning to the Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When will you come to play with me again?" asked Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait for me when I have free time, at least... um, during summer vacation," said Lornell. Although he also lives in Emerald City, he is now in elementary school and needs to go to school every day. After school, the Quentin family has arranged a lot of study materials for him. Just reading those difficult medical books takes up a lot of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you come to visit me during the summer vacation, will you bring me some delicious food?" She looked at me with eager eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Is eating all she can think of? He felt a vein pop on his forehead, but upon meeting her gaze, he couldn't bear to refuse. "I suppose... I will."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have any toys? Will you bring them for me too?" she continued to eagerly ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Probably...maybe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the little guy received a satisfactory answer, he waved towards him happily and said, "Bye-bye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell suddenly had a strange feeling. He thought that if he were to return to the Quentin family, Tina would miss him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sitting in the car on the way back, Lornell looked at the red ink stains on his hand. His subordinate was holding a wet tissue, intending to help him wipe off the ink stains.</p></div>
