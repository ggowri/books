        <h1>Chapter 371</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo; He asked deeply while looking meaningfully at her face that had gradually begun to turn red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ding!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elevator arrived on the first floor. They walked toward where Hadwin had parked his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was eager to bid him farewell. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for today. Bye-bye!&rdquo; She immediately turned around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Hadwin suddenly reached out and grabbed her by the arm before pulling her into his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Lina shrieked softly as her nose bumped into Hadwin&rsquo;s chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;That was painful!&rsquo; Lina rubbed her nose. Her nose had experienced similar trauma several times in the past. Nevertheless, even if her nose were made of steel, it would not have been able to withstand that much pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin bent down and brought his lips closer to her ears as he whispered, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that as long as I keep my mouth shut about what happened in the hotel, you&rsquo;ll agree to a request of mine?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina&rsquo;s ears were tickled by Hadwin&rsquo;s breath. She felt her body gradually begin to heat up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What... sort of request do you have?&rdquo; Lina licked her rather lips that were rather dry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I want you to kiss me and say that the person you like the most is me,&rdquo; Hadwin replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Huh?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. &ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, right here,&rdquo; Hadwin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;But the thing is... we&rsquo;re in the suburbs, and it&rsquo;s not even 8 PM. There are so many people walking around. Even if the parking lot were a little secluded and there weren&rsquo;t so many people walking around, it would not be completely deserted either.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina bit her lip. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we change locations?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why? Are you embarrassed to be with me? Is that why you don&rsquo;t dare to go out in public with me?&rdquo; Hadwin raised a brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. This place is too crowded and we&rsquo;ll be noticed by others. What if we become the talk of the town...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin responded with a question, &ldquo;So what? Aren&rsquo;t we a couple now? It&rsquo;s only normal for you to kiss me. Even if people want to gossip, let them be.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;The problem is, we&rsquo;re going to break up someday!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, at this moment, Lina dared not speak her thoughts. After all, the conclusion was silent knowledge for both of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Under the moonlight, Lina blinked as she stared at the man in front of her. The moonlight shone on his fair skin, giving it a soft glow. His pair of beautiful and captivating eyes, straight nose, and sexy lips. He was without a doubt a temptation in one&rsquo;s eyes even though he was only standing still silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they first met, Lina was stunned by Hadwin&rsquo;s looks. He appeared handsome yet beautiful at the same time. Nevertheless, nobody ever mistook him for a lady.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Hadwin seemed much more beautiful than he did back then. His sunny disposition mixed with gloominess led to his bright aura being toned down. However, it gave him a mysterious air that prompted others&rsquo; curiosity to get to know him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina slowly curled her arms around Hadwin&rsquo;s neck as she tiptoed gently. A kiss, it was only a simple task for her; she was not against kissing him. More accurately... she enjoyed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, Lina decided to savor the moment and feelings while they were still together. As for the day they would break up, she would then iron out her feelings and take it as if she had done so to repay her debt or just casually date someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those were the thoughts in her mind when she kissed his lips.</p></div>
