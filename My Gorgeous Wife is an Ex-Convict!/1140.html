        <h1>Chapter 1139</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If deities and Buddha really existed, could they show her some mercy and let her... be able to let go of this relationship? Could they let her heart that had once fallen for that man restore its peace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that sometimes, being able to not love was a blessing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Down the hill, Jason sat in the car as he leaned against the backseat, closing his eyes slowly to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, who was in the front, was looking fearfully in the rear-view mirror at his boss in the backseat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed had done nothing after seeing Grace just now. It was as if he no longer cared about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least... that was what it &lsquo;seemed&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, was it really the case? Terrence was suspicious. After all, one could say that Terrence had seen it all since Jason and Grace met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he naturally understood how important Grace had been to Master Reed. Even if Grace had wanted to kill Master Reed, Master Reed would have let her do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could Master Reed really not love the woman he once loved so deeply in such a short time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, the more indifferent he was, the more it represented that Master Reed could not let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, is the party Patrick mentioned last time today?" Jason slowly parted his lips and asked, but his eyes did not open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was shocked and immediately replied, "Yes, it's today! It's at Tianxiang Pavilion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tianxiang Pavilion was a nightclub with many beautiful women. Some were forced to earn a living, while some were deliberately there to find a rich husband. After all, many of Emerald City's rich men liked to go there to hold parties or find excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make the arrangements. I'm going there tonight," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was dumbfounded. 'No way... Does Master Reed want to go there? Master Reed never liked to set foot in places like that. Why today&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Has he been triggered by Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence made many speculations in his heart, but he dared not say anything more, so he just responded quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tianxiang Pavilion was going to be busy tonight. Countless women would be going to great lengths for Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace came to the police station after receiving a call from them. Only when she arrived did she find Brian and Stella there as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Stella caught sight of Grace, she immediately approached her and said, "Grace, you're here. Are you here to hear the final results of the police's investigation regarding the lounge incident?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace replied lightly and glanced at Stella. "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... here for the results too." Stella forced a smile. "After all, I'm the one who got you into this. The perpetrator was supposed to be trying to harm me. After all, I was supposed to be the one entering the lounge, but I didn't expect to get you into this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her eyebrows slightly. "Get me into this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I got you into this." Stella wore a guilty expression. "Grace, I'm so sorry and upset that this has happened to you. As soon as I knew that the police had the results of their investigation, I asked Brian to bring me here immediately."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Coincidentally, she had been visiting Brian today to get some information about the case when the police called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hastened to show her sisterly affection for Grace and insisted on coming with him.</p></div>
