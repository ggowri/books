        <h1>Chapter 2813</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car was silent throughout the journey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hung her head low. No one knew what she was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian parked his car at the cemetery parking lot near the entrance, Valda Theller suddenly said, "I... I just think your chances of falling in love with me are slim. It won't be me even if you do end up falling in love with another woman in the future. So I... I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not go on. She felt inferior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was so different from him in terms of family background and everything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian quietly peered at the person in front of him. Moments later, he unbuckled his seat belt, leaned over slightly, and raised Valda Theller's jaw with his slender fingers. "Are you that unsure of yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips said gently, "Then you'd better remember what I'm saying now. You're the first person I've decided to try to love in years. If there's ever a chance I can fall in love with someone, then I think you're the most likely person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, surprised that he would say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He withdrew his hand and said indifferently, "Alright, let's get out of the car." She got out of the car and took her bag from the backseat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a while to come to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not help looking at him blankly when she walked up to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to muster her courage to say, "Am I... really the person you're most likely to fall in love with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think anyone can be my girlfriend?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head quickly. Her adorable appearance made Brian feel as if he were in a better mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Come on, lead the way. I don't know the way here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then gathered herself and took Brian to her parents' tombs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the photos of a man and woman in their 30s on the tombstone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew she was young when her parents left, and her parents were also young.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller crouched down, laid out the food and wine, then lit the candles and incense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom and Dad, I came to see you again. I'm accompanied by my boyfriend, Brian, who&rsquo;s a nice person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She murmured before holding up the incense and bowed. At the same time, she whispered in her heart, hoping they could bless her relationship and keep Brian safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finished offering the incense and stood aside. Brian offered the incense and bowed three times toward the tombstones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Few people in Emerald City could make him bow like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Uncle and Aunt. I&rsquo;ll take care of Valda, so don't worry," said Brian. Even if it did not work out between them, he would do his best to protect Valda Theller!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After offering the incense, the two stayed quietly in front of the tomb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mountain breeze blew slowly, making people feel comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today was not Tomb-Sweeping Day or winter solstice, so there were few people. Looking around, they were the only ones there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Brian's outfit today. He was wearing a white top, black pants, and shoes. The simple black and white outfit set off his model-like figure and made him look clean, smart, and collected.</p></div>
