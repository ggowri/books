        <h1>Chapter 3371</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chandler!" Tina looked at Chandler anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I remember the Mond family," said Chandler in a calm tone. He then lowered his head and met Tina's anxious and doubtful gaze. "Tina, let's go. I'll tell you everything you want to know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took Tina's hand and left while speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lonny looked worried and asked, "Miss, why did you say that just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't say anything wrong!" Laura said confidently, shaking off her fear. "Anyway, I heard from my parents that she was a child bride, you know, a girl who was sold by her own parents!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But the Stephenson family shouldn't be in that situation. The kind of people who are sold are usually from families who are too poor to take care of their daughters, so they sell them as child brides." Lonny explained. "Anyway, Miss, you shouldn't have said that just now, and you shouldn't say it again in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why, I don't want to!" Laura said unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lonny felt uncomfortable speaking in front of others about his own miss because the Mond family was too powerful to mess with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Stephenson family alone is enough to give the Mond family a headache, not to mention Mr. Hunter, whose background is probably on par with, if not surpassing, that of the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vice President Gary, who was standing aside, looked at Lonny with sympathy. "I think the Mond family should start planning ahead. If Mr. Hunter decides to let go of today's incident, then it's fine. But if he decides to take action, then the Mond family..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vice President Gary didn't finish his sentence, but Lonny already understood what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of person is Mr. Hunter?" Lonny asked cautiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In short, they are people who cannot be provoked by the Mond family," Vice President Gary replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Lonny's face turned extremely pale, while Laura remained confused and unaware that her actions today would change the course of her future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina followed Chandler to the outside of the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler asked Tina, "Didn't you say you were hungry? What would you like to eat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chandler, can you tell me, am I really a child bride? Did my parents sell me?" Tina is concerned about this issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want to believe Laura's words because she understood that Laura was intentionally saying those things to make her angry, sad, and upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Chandler didn't argue, which made her feel uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If what Laura said was false, why didn't Chandler say anything earlier?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler looked at Tina and said, "Let's find a place to eat and I'll talk to you while we eat, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you want to eat?" Chandler continued to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Donuts," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he took her to a famous dessert restaurant in Emerald City, found a small private room, and ordered some sweets that she liked.</p></div>
