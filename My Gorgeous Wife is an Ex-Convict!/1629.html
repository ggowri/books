        <h1>Chapter 1627</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is it Lawyer Kang Milo?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you know about him?" Grace was slightly stunned. Then, she realized that he must have looked into her history in L City when she got back to Emerald City. She nodded and said, "Yes, that was also the first time I met my mentor. I won that lawsuit, and my mentor lost, but he wasn&rsquo;t mad. Instead, he took me in as an apprentice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That lawsuit was a rare failure for her mentor, but Grace still felt warm when she thought of what he had said to her at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Regardless of failure, the most important thing is the pursuit of the truth. Although we lawyers should be representing our clients, we shouldn't be ignorant and not pursue the truth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her mentor was a righteous lawyer who was also highly respected in the legal world. He was someone Grace admired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The person today is Damian Harmon. He used to be a government staff, but he lost his job because he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. It seems that his family spent a lot of money and even took on some debts," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, it was not difficult to understand Damian Harmon's hostility and resentment toward her. However, they not only targeted her today but also mentioned her mentor...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace instantly shuddered at the thought of it. "By the way, will today's incident be on the news? If it affects my mentor..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't worry, I had someone take care of it and won't let it go viral online," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace knew that since he had said so, today's incident would not spread even if there were some discussions online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, she still called her mentor in L City and told him about it, lest it was mentioned in front of him and he was caught off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, she did not want her mentor's reputation to be tarnished, especially by such dirty slander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mentor, I'm sorry. I'll take care of it. We've reported it to the police, and the man is also being held in custody. However, it happened downtown. Even if relevant news is deleted, I'm afraid there&rsquo;ll still be some&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You need not be afraid of these things if you've done nothing wrong." Old Lawyer Watts's voice sounded from the other end of the line with a strangely soothing charm. "You and I both did nothing wrong in that case. Since we&rsquo;ve chosen a career as a lawyer, we'll always be facing these doubts. If you plan to continue working in this field, you may face more of these doubts in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But you said Jason is very kind to you on the phone last time, so I&rsquo;m relieved as well. I'll come to Emerald City next time to visit you, Jasper, and the Mick you mentioned," said Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I should bring them to L City to see you," Grace said quickly. After all, her mentor was old now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Haha. Just assume I want to visit Emerald City too. I'll go there as soon as I finish my cases,&rdquo; said Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two talked for a while longer before ending their call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It seems you have great respect for your mentor," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Yes, he's a very righteous person. I won the lawsuit against him, but he was not unhappy at all. He valued the truth of the case more. He said we should protect the interests of our clients, but it doesn't mean that we have to be ignorant and make things up to protect them. That&rsquo;ll only create more injustice and victims in the world."</p></div>
