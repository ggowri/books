        <h1>Chapter 938</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trial would begin in a few days. Grace felt powerless as she thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she came back to her senses, she found that the car had stopped at a styling shop Jason had taken her to before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked, and she asked the driver, "Why are we here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver simply said, "Mr. Reed is waiting inside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said nothing and got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she entered the shop, the shop manager greeted her and said enthusiastically, "You must be Miss Cummins. Please follow me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed the shop manager to a room on the second floor where Jason was sitting on a couch with a light purple gown hanging on a hanger next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a beautiful gown with deep purple and white crystals inlaid, making it look elegant and classic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Accompany me to a banquet tonight. Try on the gown," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A banquet?" Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just an ordinary banquet. There's no need to be too nervous," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had accompanied Jason to a banquet before, but it was not a very good experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wondered if anything would happen at the banquet today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went into the changing room and changed into the gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had to admit that Jason was considerate in choosing her gown. The scars on her body were all covered up and hidden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only thing that was showing was probably her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The joints of her fingers were slightly deformed. They looked alright from a distance, but once you looked at them closely, you could notice the deformities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the only thing the gown could not hide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes flashed with amazement when Grace walked out of the changing room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw the gown, he thought it suited her, so he bought the limited one-piece only designer handmade gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She indeed looked beautiful now that she was wearing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Beautiful." He stepped forward with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips together and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He picked up the jewelry that was lying in a jewelry box nearby and put on a white pearl necklace for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the string of pearls. Each was large, round, and shiny with no flaws. The necklace was probably worth tens of millions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at herself in a full-length mirror. She looked beautiful, elegant, and poised. No one would know she was just a paralegal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After he dressed her up, she now looked like a doll.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis, do you like it?" he murmured, leaning over from behind while bringing his face close to her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking in the mirror, they looked as intimate as a couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff was stunned. 'Did Mr. Reed call her... Sis?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on here? When Mr. Reed first brought the lady over, she seemed to be Mr. Reed's girlfriend!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the staff member was full of shock and speculation, she dared not ask anything.</p></div>
