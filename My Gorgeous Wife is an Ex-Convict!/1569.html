        <h1>Chapter 1567</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After closing the web page, Lina sent a message to her blind date that night. The most important thing now was for her to go on blind dates!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe she could find someone she liked who could also reciprocate her feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At night, Lina went to the plaza in tMason Swansonty center at the appointed time and met Anthony Sherman, her blind date today. He was said to be the department head of a big company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Lina saw him in person, she could not help exclaiming to herself, 'The blind date Mom set up for me this time... is a little too good.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman was dressed in a suit and tie. He wore gold-rimmed glasses. He looked well-mannered and was indeed good-looking. Her mother said he was two years older than her. He was 35 but looked like he was in his early 30s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hello, you must be Miss Sweeney. Nice to meet you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hello," Lina said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After exchanging some pleasantries, they reached a restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina originally just wanted to have a meal and chat at a random restaurant, but the restaurant Anthony Sherman took her to was not cheap. It was a restaurant with a good dining environment. Of course, the prices here were not cheap either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Sweeney, you can order whatever you want," he said politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina thought about it and ordered some relatively cheap dishes. Anthony Sherman's thoughtful eyes flickered for a moment, but he did not say anything and ordered a few more dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Sweeney, why did you agree to go on blind dates? Do you think you have to marry someone because it's time?" asked Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's not that I have to marry someone. After all, it's not like you can't live without marriage, but... I don&rsquo;t want my family to worry and think there&rsquo;s something wrong with me. Won&rsquo;t it be nice if I actually meet the right person on a blind date?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman muttered, "Really? Then we're in the same boat. I don't want my family to worry too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's good. We're really similar," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They had a good chat during the meal. Although they were in different fields, they could find common topics to talk about. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For example, the two of them had similar tastes in TV shows. They enjoyed those cheesy romance dramas. In particular, they had been watching the same TV show recently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you think... it's strange for a man to enjoy watching these romance dramas?" Anthony Sherman asked, sounding as though he was a little embarrassed about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's so strange about that? Many romance dramas are written by men," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she was a little surprised after learning that Anthony Sherman never had an official girlfriend. After all, this man was not bad-looking. He had a good job, a house, and a car. It surprised her that he was her blind date today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He&rsquo;s never had a girlfriend. Are all the women around him... blind?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you sure you&rsquo;ve never had a girlfriend?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is it because you have high standards?"</p></div>
