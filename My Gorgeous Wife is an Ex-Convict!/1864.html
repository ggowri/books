        <h1>Chapter 1862</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's skin that was exposed outside her clothes was now cold. Jason said, "Take a nap. I'll wake you up when we reach Reed Residence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You won't... go missing again, will you?" she asked worriedly as it was only by chance that she managed to find him this time. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "No, so go to sleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was reassured, and she was indeed tired after this long day. Grace slowly closed her eyes and fell asleep soon after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked at her sleeping face with a thoughtful look in his dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car drove slowly toward Reed Residence and soon arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Instead of waking her up, Jason carried her straight back to their bedroom and gently put her on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, I can't let that woman go, so don't plead for that woman anymore, okay?" he muttered in a voice that sounded like a warning and a plea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina saw Grace, all she saw was her best friend's sad face. "What's wrong? What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, in Lina's opinion, her best friend was now the mistress of the Reed family and Jason was so in love with her. Besides, she had also found her child. One could say that everything was going well for Grace right now. She should have nothing to worry about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm facing some troubles," Grace said as she hesitated a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Can't Jason help you solve them?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace smiled bitterly, "Someone has always been kind to me, but that person offended Jay and Jay won&rsquo;t let that person go. They did something really bad to Jay, and I'm not sure whether to plead for them or not.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina also frowned after hearing that. "It seems to be a real dilemma. Is this what it means by not being able to have it all?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What about you? How are you doing now?" Instead of talking about her troubles, Grace changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Not bad. I eat good food and sleep well every day. I don't have morning sickness that much anymore. I guess the baby is being considerate of me, " Lina said with a smile as she patted her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What about... Hadwin Stephenson? Are you sure you won&rsquo;t contact him? Is he really ignoring you and the baby?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina suddenly felt a little guilty. "Uh, he... probably doesn&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m keeping the baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you mean?" Grace froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... said I wanted to have an abortion in front of him, so he probably thinks the baby is gone," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was immediately speechless when she heard that. "In other words, Hadwin Stephenson thinks that you aborted the baby when you didn't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... guess so," muttered Lina.</p></div>
