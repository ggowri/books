        <h1>Chapter 1234</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Isn't it Chase Harper who Grace cares about? Why did she marry Jason? Is it for the baby in her belly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, I must clarify this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once the call ended, Brian suddenly got up and grabbed the car keys before heading out the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, wait! Where are you going?" asked Patrick as he quickly stopped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to see Grace and find out what the hell is going on. I need to know whether there's more to this!" Brian said with an irritable look on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way she had stopped his car that morning kept recurring to him. When he had chosen to close his eyes out of jealousy and ignored her, the expression he saw was one of despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did I miss something?' His heart gave a sharp wrench at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You haven't even recovered! Why don't you... let me drive? I'll go with you," said Patrick. After all, he had shown Brian the photo, so he was partly to blame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, he had known Brian and Jason for years. He was afraid that they would get into a fight because of Grace again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Patrick had not forgotten the way Jason strangled Brian for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said nothing more, and Patrick grabbed the car keys from his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, a silver-gray car drove out of the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Grace came out of the medical examination room and saw Jason playing with her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All done?" He looked up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but the full report won't be out until tomorrow," said Grace as she tried to get her phone out of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason showed no intention of returning the phone to her and asked, "Did you delete my phone numbers?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately felt awkward. "Yeah." She wanted a clean breakup, so she had naturally deleted his phone numbers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a person&rsquo;s memories were unlike phones where you could delete things whenever you wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she had deleted the numbers in her phone, she could still recite his two phone numbers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's slender fingers quickly tapped on Grace's phone. Controlling the phone with one hand, his movements seemed elegant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He returned the phone to her after saving both his phone numbers on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the two numbers he had just saved. The caller ID was: Hubby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face could not help reddening. 'Hubby... Yes, we're already married. I should get used to the changes of some titles.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't delete my phone numbers again. Never!" He bent down and looked at her almost at eye level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A heavy feeling immediately pressed on her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After coming out of the hospital, Grace only felt drowsy and unconsciously fell asleep as she sat in the car. Looking at Grace's sleeping face, the corners of Jason's lips could not help raising.</p></div>
