        <h1>Chapter 1959</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She once said to him with a smile, "Hadwin, how about I prepare a cake for you every birthday from now on? I'll eat a slice of your birthday cake every year until our hair turns white and our teeth fall out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Every birthday? Does that mean you'll stay with me until we're old?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Didn't you say we can't break up if we started dating? Look, I have no intention of breaking up with you. I'm gonna hang on to you for the rest of my life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, hang on to me for the rest of your life. You're not allowed to go away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Their laughter and sweet words at the time seemed to still echo in his ears. He never expected them to break up and he was the one who initiated it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can wait if you think you can, but I don't know when I'll be back," Hadwin Stephenson said gruffly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Color returned to her pale little face as he said this. Her pitiful expression vanished and turned into happiness. "I'll wait for you no matter how late it is!" She grinned at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was silly to see that smile with her swollen cheeks, but he watched it with some fascination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, Hadwin Stephenson closed his eyes as he lay in bed, but he was sleepy at all. All he could think about was Lina's voice and smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The room the butler had arranged for her was right next to his. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For some reason, the thought of her sleeping in the next room seemed to make him even more agitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, his room door was suddenly pushed open and someone crept in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Only... that woman Lina dares to enter my room at this hour!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson speculated. Sure enough, the next moment, Lina's voice rang in the room. "Hadwin, are you asleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson closed his eyes and did not speak, intending to pretend to sleep to have her go back to her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina went to Hadwin Stephenson's bedside while holding a large pregnancy pillow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Realizing that Hadwin Stephenson had fallen asleep, Lina hesitated for a moment and said, "Well... it's my first night here. It's hard to sleep alone in the guest room. I'm sure you know it's not good for the baby in the belly if the mother can't sleep, so I thought I'd sleep in your room. Is that okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson could not help but wonder if she was only asking because she could see that he was pretending to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, what she said next left him speechless. What she said was... "If you don't object, that means you agree. Don't worry. I'm a good sleeper!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'This woman... did it on purpose! Would anyone asleep be able to object?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For a moment, Hadwin Stephenson began to wonder whether to open his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, he felt a slight movement on the other side of the bed. It was obvious that she was climbing onto the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was a rustling sound, and the room was quiet again. However, before he could think of what to do next, a hand pressed on his arm and then a thigh rested on his thigh.</p></div>
