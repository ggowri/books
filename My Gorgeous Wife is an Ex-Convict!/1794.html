        <h1>Chapter 1792</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I didn't expect myself to get pregnant so easily. I was so drunk that day that I had no idea what I was doing," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what are you going to do now?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was silent for quite some time before saying, "I don't know. This baby was never in my plan. If I give birth to the baby, people will criticize me unless I marry Hadwin Stephenson, but... I'm scared..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You&rsquo;re scared that Hadwin Stephenson doesn't love you enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What he loves most is his career and success. His upbringing made him strive for money and power. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. After all, no law says that love is the right choice when choosing between career and love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina paused and smiled bitterly. "I'm just scared that I'll love him so much if I marry him, yet I won&rsquo;t be as carefree as him. I won&rsquo;t be able to take it if he wants to divorce me one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla patted Lina's shoulder. "Whether you want this child or not, you have the right to choose. But once you make your choice, don't ever regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina froze and looked at Kyla. "Well... Kyla, have you ever regretted it after giving birth to Nelson?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I&rsquo;ve never regretted giving birth to him. I'm even glad that I gave birth to him. Without him, I would&rsquo;ve stopped having the courage to live long ago. You can even call him my emotional pillar of support," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked down somewhat blankly at her flat belly. 'What about me... What will this child be to me? Support or... burden?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's operation was completed eight hours later. It went smoothly and was carried out in the best way possible. There were also no accidents during the operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the result would depend on the recovery after the operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell came out with a tired look on his face and informed the crowd waiting at the operating room&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Dr. Russell, thank you. If there's anything you need, I'll help you out!" said Jason. There were only a handful of people in Emerald City who could get such a promise from Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wait and see how the girl recovers after this before you thank me,&rdquo; Dr. Russell said and walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had not woken up yet due to the anesthesia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina and Kyla said to Jason, "Grace will probably be too exhausted to talk to us when she wakes up later. We'll go home first. We'll come and see her another day!" Now that the result of the operation was out, they felt more at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason replied, "Okay, I'll have someone send you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No thanks. I drove here, and I'll send Kyla home," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell went to a private lounge the hospital had given him. Brian was sitting inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How was the operation?" Brian asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since you're worried about her, why weren&rsquo;t you waiting at the operating room&rsquo;s entrance?" asked Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian said, "You know why. I'm leaving Emerald City by plane tonight. I just want to know if her operation is successful before I leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a touch of loneliness on his face as he said this.</p></div>
