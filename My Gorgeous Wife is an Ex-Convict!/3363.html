        <h1>Chapter 3361</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't overthink it," Brian said, afraid that Valda would get stuck on the fight. "Harley will know that fighting is useless. There are better ways to make others shut up. And also..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's voice trailed off as he stared deeply into Valda's eyes. "You are Harley's mother. Without you, there would be no her. She is your daughter, and it's your duty to protect her. Valda, your leg is proof that you saved Jasmine and that you love me enough to sacrifice for me. So don't dwell on it, don't regret it...will you marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was afraid that she would feel insecure about her leg and regret being with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had worked hard to open her heart, and he couldn't let her close it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Brian's worried face and smiled gently, holding his face in her hands. "Brian, I won't regret it. Marrying you is the best decision I've ever made in my life. I feel happy to have given birth to Harley."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She kissed him on the lips and continued, "Although I know that in the future, Harley may be laughed at because of me, I hope she can become stronger and fearless. And I will also become better, so that fewer and fewer people will laugh at me and more and more people will admire me. They won't laugh at me anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was surprised by Valda's words. He didn't expect her to say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda had been changing and becoming stronger over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We will, we will definitely do that in the future!" Brian said softly, picking up Valda and carrying her to the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He carefully placed her on the bed, his eyes burning with love. "Valda, I love you. Whatever happens in the future, we will face it together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's face it together," she smiled, her face blushing slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the rosy hue on her face was undoubtedly the most fatal temptation for him, and he suddenly kissed her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A passionate kiss, completely different from his usual cold and distant demeanor towards others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His passion was only given to her and his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda lifted both of her hands and wrapped them around Brian's neck...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The kiss deepened continuously, just like their love for each other, which also grew deeper with the passing of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to the fight, Tina has been punished for several days. Not only did her parents scold her, but even Chandler scolded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Chandler is also the most well-trained one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, Tina feels very miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How old are you? You're already thinking about fighting with others. Do you know that asking Jasmine to call for help is not the right thing to do? Why didn't you think about asking Jasmine to directly call us adults for help? All she does is call for people to fight." In the living room of the Stephenson family, Lina is scolding her daughter again.</p></div>
