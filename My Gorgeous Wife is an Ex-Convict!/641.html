        <h1>Chapter 640</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was young, he had to be careful with every step he took as the old man in front of him was the one who controlled his destiny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, one day when he could control his destiny, he realized he was already old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were grandfather and grandson, but other than blood ties, they did not have much affection for each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to marry Grace." A cold voice broke the silence in the room. Jason spoke as if he was just announcing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Marry?" Old Master Reed chuckled. "That woman doesn't deserve the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's up to me to decide whether she deserves it," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed grunted. "I hear you're helping to reverse that woman's case?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his lips together. He knew that the old man had people to inquire about these things. Although he was hospitalized for a long time, he knew a lot about what he should know and what he should not know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does that woman know you somehow had something to do with her case?" Old Master Reed asked casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face darkened. "I've told you, she'll never find out about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I tell her? I&rsquo;m not sure if she&rsquo;ll still be willing to marry you after she finds out. Of course, if she&rsquo;s a money-oriented person, she&rsquo;ll marry you anyway. After all, if she marries into a rich and powerful family like the Reed family, she'll have all the money to spend. However, do you want to marry a woman like your mother who only wants money, Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed was like a demon right now, placing two dead-ends in front of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Grace did not want to marry him after she knew about it, then the wedding would not happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if Grace found out and was still willing to marry him, it would only prove that Grace was after the Reed family's money. Jason's mother, who once married his father for the Reed family's money, later abandoned his father because he had no money. That was what Jason resented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, once Grace knew the truth, the wedding would not happen either way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked to his bedside with a cold face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary, who had been at the old man's side, immediately lunged forward and stopped Jason. "Young Master, please..." However, before he could finish talking, Jason had lifted one foot and kicked him to the ground while the other stepped on his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary let out a cry of pain, but when he tried to get up, Jason's foot was still on his chest. It was impossible for him to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked down at Old Master Reed who was on the hospital bed. His dark eyes were full of cold rage. "If you don't want the Reed family to be ruined, you'd better shut your mouth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To Old Master Reed, the Reed family was equivalent to his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you dare!" Old Master Reed's face suddenly turned red as he coughed violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said coldly, "Do you think I don't have the guts?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed finally stopped coughing and said bitterly, "If you lose the Reed family, do you think you&rsquo;ll still be as glorious as you are now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't even care about myself. Do you think I care about glory? I can make the Reed family thrive or cease. If you think it's all right for me to ruin the Reed family, you can try," said Jason.</p></div>
