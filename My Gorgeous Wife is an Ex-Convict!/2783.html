        <h1>Chapter 2781</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, someone came back to their senses and said to Brian, "How arrogant! Who do you think you are? Are you Brian, the crown prince of the entertainment industry? How ridiculous!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at them coldly. "I am Brian. Is it funny?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cold gaze and indifferent tone gave the speaker earlier a sense of uneasiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is... this man Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How... How is that possible? How can you be Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a timid voice said, "He... He seems to be Brian. I&rsquo;ve seen Brian's photo online. He looks... just like him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was an eerie silence in the air as soon as he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he really Brian?' Barbara Schuman looked at the handsome man protecting Valda Theller in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could tell that the man wore expensive clothes, and he spoke with an air of authority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is... what Camille Strickland said true? Is Valda Theller's boyfriend Brian?' Barbara Schuman's pupils shrank at the thought of this. 'Is it possible? The Valda Theller I despise has gotten together with a man in Emerald City who&rsquo;s impossible to seduce?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Brian picked up his phone and spoke to the other end of the line, "Send some people in and get the car ready outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Brian put away the phone and carefully picked up Valda Theller in his arms. "Alright, stop crying. Lean on me and rest. Just get some sleep," he said gently. However, his voice turned icy as soon as he looked up. "I&rsquo;ll spare no one who hurt you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, several men in black were already hurrying toward them. As soon as they saw Brian, they respectfully said, "Mr. Hart..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ask everyone here exactly what they did and said. No one is allowed to leave until we sort it out," Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," his men answered immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone could not help shouting, "Even... Even if you're Brian, you can't force us to stay here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced coldly. "Why don't you try and see if I can?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was hardly any fluctuation in his calm tone, but no one could retort him. He was the crown prince. With his influence, no one could walk out of here even if they wanted to. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was about to leave with Valda Theller in his arms. A figure suddenly ran out and rushed up to Brian. They repeatedly bowed and said, "Mr. Hart, it's my fault. I didn't recognize you and said something I shouldn't have said. Mr. Hart, please be the bigger person and forgive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd looked over and found that it was Rhea Oliver speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver had been arrogant after getting together with the heir of the Lu family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had also invited Rhea Oliver to the class reunion. They thought Rhea Oliver was not coming. Who knew she would appear in this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Rhea Oliver they knew had always appeared in front of them in delicate makeup and expensive clothes to show off her lavish lifestyle. She never had her hair in a messy simple updo, nor was she ever seen with no makeup on her face. Her clothes looked wrinkled as if she had come over in a hurry.</p></div>
