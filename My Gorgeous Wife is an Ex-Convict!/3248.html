        <h1>Chapter 3246</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, he never gave her a wedding, not even this wedding photo shoot today, which was delayed for so many years before they finally took it together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They met too early, but were separated too many times, and too much time was wasted between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Martin looked at Kyla, she was also looking at him, dressed in a black suit that wrapped around his slender figure, looking elegant and handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew better than anyone else how good his figure was, and today's photo shoot was actually fulfilling a wish in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You look beautiful," Martin said. "We will definitely take very beautiful photos today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," Kyla smiled. "You look handsome too. If I didn't know you, I might have thought you were a celebrity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them, along with the crew, got into the car and headed to the shooting location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla chose a secluded place for the shoot, but it was surrounded by beautiful mountains and water, with picturesque scenery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just like a place you would choose," Martin said. "You once said that if you ever took wedding photos, you would choose a place with mountains and water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla paused for a moment, realizing that it was something she had said to him during the sweetest time they had spent together a long time ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So long ago... do you still remember?" she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, I remember," he said. He used to think he would forget, but strangely enough, as time passed, the words she had said became even more vividly imprinted in his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla's eyes were a bit moist, and she quickly took a deep breath, trying hard to suppress the urge to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">We're about to take photos soon, so no crying allowed! Otherwise, your makeup will be ruined for nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the shooting began, Martin was exceptionally cooperative, and the combination of handsome men and beautiful women made the scene naturally very pleasing to the eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the photographer praised the natural feeling captured in their photos, with every smile and expression appearing genuine and not at all contrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing the wedding photoshoot, Kyla and Martin went to two other locations to take photos in their everyday clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When shooting a scene, Martin is required to bend down and look at Kyla, while Kyla looks up and wraps her arms around Martin's neck. Their faces are close together, as if they are about to kiss, but their lips are not touching, creating a romantic and ambiguous atmosphere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin followed the photographer's instructions and bent down, his handsome face suddenly enlarged in front of Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Kyla wrapped her arms around Martin's neck, the photographer instructed, "Get closer, yes, even closer...closer...alright, Mrs. Ye, tilt your head a little to the side..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The photographer directed their movements for a while until he was satisfied and ready to start shooting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla gazed at the handsome face so close to hers and whispered in a voice only they could hear, "Martin, how much do you love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze slightly intensified as he replied in a low voice, "Why do you suddenly ask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just curious," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pursed his lips for a moment before answering, "I want to spend the rest of my life with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled sweetly, and in that moment, it was as if the camera, the sound of the shutter, and everything around them ceased to exist. Her eyes were fixed only on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then don't forget that you love me this much, okay?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forget? How could he ever forget?</p></div>
