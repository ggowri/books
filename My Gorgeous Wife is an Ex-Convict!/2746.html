        <h1>Chapter 2744</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was only his nominal girlfriend. He had no affection for her. They were not even friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After wiping the tears on her face, Valda Theller got off the bus. Instead of returning to her residence immediately, she went to the nearby supermarket to buy some groceries before going home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she never expected to see Brian when she reached the entrance of her apartment unit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tall figure was standing in front of her door. He stepped forward at the sight of her. "You're back. I was going to look for you if you hadn&rsquo;t come back soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it?" she asked as she bit her lip slightly, her tone estranged and polite. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned slightly. For some reason, he was upset with her tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know I shouldn't have criticized you in the hospital today... Sorry," he said. He seldom apologized, but he was now sincerely apologizing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze and looked blankly at him as her jaw dropped. It was as if she did not expect him to apologize so suddenly. "It... It's okay. Of course, you're more worried about Grace. I... I understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes narrowed suddenly as he grabbed her jaw with one hand. "Have you been crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was startled. She tried looking away, but she could not move because he had grabbed her chin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh... I accidentally got sand in my eye on the way back. And... tears came out." She made up excuses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression changed slightly. "I'm sorry." It was the second time he had apologized to her today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said awkwardly, "I got sand in my eyes. It has nothing to do with you. Why don't you go in first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He withdrew his hand. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took out the key, opened the door, and the two entered the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "What would you like to drink? Tea, water, or coffee?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so polite it was as if she was treating a guest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Water will do," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, wait a minute," she said and poured him a glass of warm water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took a sip of water and said to her, "Do you mind making dinner for one more person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated for a moment and said, "No... I don't." He had tried her cooking before anyway. "I'll go do it now," she said, intending to go into the kitchen and cook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he grabbed her and said, "Wait."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him strangely and saw that he had suddenly pulled up her sleeve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the scratches on her left wrist instantly came into view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She moved her wrist to withdraw her hand, but his hand grabbed it firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry I misunderstood you. I didn't know," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She chuckled awkwardly. "You already apologized to me earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt?" Looking at the red marks, he thought of what Kyla had said. Grace had grabbed her all the way to the hospital, but Valda Theller said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't hurt so much anymore. It&rsquo;ll go away in a couple of days," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you applied any ointment?" he asked.</p></div>
