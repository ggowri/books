        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Harley chuckled and said, "No need, Dad. Like I said, I only see him as a friend. I do have a soft spot for him, but not in that way. If you really go out of your way to groom him, wouldn't that just confirm the rumors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just friends, huh..." Brian raised an eyebrow slightly, "I'm just worried that sometimes you might not see your feelings clearly, and you might miss out on something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he only saw Valda as a friend, a safe harbor to escape his emotions. He never admitted that his feelings for Valda had gradually turned into love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until she was in danger when he thought he had completely lost her, that he finally understood just how much he loved this woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on, when Valda was able to return to his side and become his wife, he truly felt it was a mercy from heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He naturally didn't want his daughter to make the same mistakes he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care whether his future son-in-law was Lornell this newcomer Calvert, or anyone else for that matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't matter whether the other person's status was high or low. Even if they were born in extreme poverty, he had ways to help them turn their life around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he wanted was for his daughter to do what she loved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his daughter liked a man, he would go to any lengths, even resorting to force or coercion, to ensure they ended up together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Harley was still young then, she might not have been able to clearly understand her own feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, that wasn't too bad. He didn't want his daughter to get married too early anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not confused about my feelings, I know them very well," Harley said. "Dad, I don't want to think about feelings right now. I'm still young, I want to take some time to think about what I really want to do after I graduate, what direction I want my life to take."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when she was in love with Lornell, all her thoughts revolved around him and the Quentin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was thinking about marrying Lornell after graduation. So, she was always pondering on how to be a good wife and how to make Lornell gradually fall in love with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she clearly had no interest in medicine, she still forced herself to read a lot of medical books and keep up with major events in the medical field. All this was just so she could have more common topics to talk about with Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, their engagement had been called off, so there was no need to continue with all these things anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she wanted to take some time to really figure out what it was that she truly wanted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take your time to think it through, and let me know when you've made up your mind. If there's anything you need my help with, don't hesitate to tell me," Brian said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, Dad!" Harley replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the days that followed, Harley's life went on as usual. Her picture with Calvert was still in Lornell's possession. Lornell didn't bring it up again, and she didn't ask about it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if this thing had never happened at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At school, she was hearing Calvert's name mentioned more and more often. It was clear that he was becoming increasingly popular these days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever he showed up at school, he would be surrounded by a swarm of girls. The area outside his classroom would be packed with people, and many would sneakily take his photos to sell them online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even some girls would deliberately rush up to him, trying to hug him and initiate intimate contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley had overheard people nearby discussing Calvert's name. She had thought to herself, maybe this was the price of fame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In a bit, I need you guys to cover for me. I'm planning to sneak into Calvert's car and go back with him. Then, when he's not paying attention, I can slip into his house," a girl at the next table was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Harley's body jolted abruptly.</span></p></div>
