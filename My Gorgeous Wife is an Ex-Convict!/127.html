        <h1>Chapter 126</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since Lina had stood up, naturally, she lifted her hand. Zoe was caught unaware and she fell to the ground. The chair that she had been sitting on fell on her and hit the leg of hers that was on its way to recovery.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe cried out in pain. When the rest of them saw her, they went over to her immediately to help her up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lina, don't you want this job anymore? How can you treat Miss Stevens in this manner?!" the director reprimanded Lina angrily.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina sneered, "You're right. I don't want this job anymore. I have had enough of it. I'm merely earning a salary, not selling myself to the design research institute as a slave. Why should I allow myself to be treated in this manner?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe said angrily, "Do you think you can get off scot-free by resigning? I will sue you for inflicting injuries on me!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Go ahead. I will sue you for deliberately hurting me too! I will go to the hospital to get an injury assessment report right away!" Lina said as she waved her injured hand before Zoe.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe was being presumptuous, but Lina was even more aggressive than her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina was fuming with anger. Since Zoe could not deal with Grace, she had chosen to attack her friend!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Listen up. Do you think Jason will back you up just because he's backing Grace up? Stop dreaming! Ho! He's just toying with her feelings. She has herself to blame for killing sister Jennifer. Do you think Jason would fall for someone who killed his fianc&eacute;e?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The minute Zoe made that comment, Lina was stunned.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jason... and Grace?" "What do you mean by that? Why would Jason back Grace up? What do you mean by saying that he's toying with her feelings?" Lina asked Zoe as she stepped forth, staring at her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe realized that she had let the cat out of the bag. Her Big Brother had instructed her not to tell anyone about it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I... I don't know what you're talking about," Zoe said as she got to her feet. She leaned on her crutch and left hastily with her nurse.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The director immediately went after her, trying to appease her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The rest of the colleagues started to blame Lina, but she took no notice of them. She was thinking over Zoe's words.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Have Jason and Grace gotten together? If that were the case, Grace would have told me about it!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Moreover, Grace is working in the Sanitation Service Center and her life is mundane. She couldn't have met Jason."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Grace had gotten out of prison, the only man that she had come into contact with was Jay, whom she had found on the streets.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Jay's name flashed through Lina's mind, she froze suddenly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay... Jason...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Could it be... Is this possible? Could such a thing happen? If Jay is Jason Reed, why was he pretending to be homeless and staying by Grace's side?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's his motive?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina's mind was in turmoil.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was able to walk on her own the following day.</p></div>
