        <h1>Chapter 2721</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was no wonder the people who attended the party looked doubtful when Brian took her there the last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their relationship had been fake from the start. She was only a fake girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had never lied to her. Therefore, even if he said he loved her in front of outsiders, she knew better than anyone that it was fake!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew how different she and Brian was, so she would not fantasize about everything that should not belong to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After everything was over, her life would return to its usual peacefulness. She considered everything now a way to make up for his kindness after he sent someone to save her on the film set!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her phone rang. Valda Theller took the phone from her pocket to look at the caller ID. It was a phone call from Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly pressed the answer button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you free tomorrow night?" His cold voice came from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Accompany me to a banquet tomorrow night," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused. "A banquet? Is it something formal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess so," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... But I don't have a gown for banquets like that," she said awkwardly. She usually had no chance to wear gowns, so she did not have clothes like that in her wardrobe. Wearing her casual clothes to a party like that would only embarrass him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll prepare it for you, and I&rsquo;ll ask the driver to pick you up tomorrow," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, good." She breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's settled, then. Good night," he said, ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait a minute," she could not help shouting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Can I help you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think anyone will believe I'm your girlfriend just because you take me to a banquet? After all, I... I'm not like your old girlfriends..." she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not? You're the girlfriend I chose. Why wouldn't anyone believe it? All you have to do is act as if you love me in front of people," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"R-Really? Okay, I see. Good night, then," she stammered in a murmur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Valda Theller looked at her phone and smiled bitterly. 'Am I... too unconfident? Do I have low self-esteem?&rsquo; She thought that she had gotten over the trauma that Raymond Bowman and Barbara Schuman gave her, but she did not realize it still existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially... when her current boyfriend was Brian&mdash;the crown prince of the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shaking her head, she told herself that she was going to be a good girlfriend no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, the Hart family's driver came to pick up Valda Theller and took her to a styling studio in Emerald City. It had a VIP membership system, and anyone who could come here was no ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller walked into the studio, someone came over and asked respectfully, "Are you Miss Valda Theller?"</p></div>
