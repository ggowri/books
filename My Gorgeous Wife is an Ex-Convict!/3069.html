        <h1>Chapter 3067</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille put down the book in her hand and almost stumbled as she walked to the bedroom door and pushed it open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she saw was a slender figure struggling to get up from the ground. Camille stared at the figure in disbelief, her eyes turning red in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was...Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Valda had lost a lot of weight compared to a year ago, and her long hair had been cut short, but...it was Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda!" Camille shouted suddenly, "You're alive? You're still alive?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she shouted, Camille ran to Valda and hugged her tightly. The real touch and warmth of her body told her that this was not her imagination!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're really alive! Why didn't you call me to tell me you're alive? Do you know how worried we were about you? Brian hasn't given up looking for you, he's been sending people to search for you all this time!" Camille said in a rush, tears streaming down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry," murmured Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know, do you have any idea how many tears I shed for you during these days? I thought I would never see you again," Camille cried and laughed, then suddenly remembered something and said, "By the way, does Brian know that you're alive? No, he probably doesn't know yet. If he did, he would probably be by your side now. I need to call him and share this good news!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille spoke and quickly took out her phone. However, just as she was about to make a call, Valda's hand pressed down on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille, don't hit!" said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille looked at Valda strangely and asked, "Valda, what's wrong? Are you planning to surprise him yourself? Should I find a reason for him to come over and then you can...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want to surprise him, I just don't want to face him yet, Camille. I came here today just to retrieve some of my personal belongings and I don't want him to know that I'm still alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda returned to her apartment and found the key to her door under the doormat, which was her habit. Surprisingly, the spare key was still there after a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So she decided to leave with something without disturbing anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But unexpectedly, they met a good friend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" Camille looked puzzled, her gaze fixed on Valda until she noticed her friend was wearing a long dress that reached down to her ankles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda never used to wear long dresses like this before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But then, her eyes widened as she noticed a crutch in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This type of crutch is usually used by people with mobility issues, propped under the armpit. And now, there was one in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, are you injured?" Camille asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, I got hurt, but I survived. It's just that one leg is a bit immobile," Valda said, bending down to pick up the crutch from the floor. She propped it under her armpit and picked up some personal items she had previously organized, hobbling out of the bedroom.</p></div>
