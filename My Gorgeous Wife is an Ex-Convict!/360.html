        <h1>Chapter 359</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she thought about this, Evelyn got more and more excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her fingers grazed something hard. She looked at it and saw that it was the silver bracelet that he was always wearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That bracelet&hellip; Evelyn stared at the silver bracelet that was on his chest. It was just an ordinary bracelet. Why did he always wear it? He was treating it like it was some kind of valuable treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn picked up the bracelet to take a closer look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the next second, a hand grabbed hers. A sharp pain started shooting from her wrist. She had no choice but to let go of the bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn groaned in pain. Her eyes met a pair of clear eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was drunk, but at this moment, his eyes did not look clouded from intoxication. Instead, they were so bright and clear that he looked scary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t touch this.&rdquo; His voice was so cold that it pierced the bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&hellip; I won&rsquo;t do it again. I just want to help you change so that you&rsquo;ll be more comfortable. I-I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it. Brian, please&hellip; Please let go&hellip;&rdquo; Evelyn was in so much pain that sweat was forming on her forehead. She felt like her wrist was about to break in half.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian let go of Evelyn&rsquo;s hand and closed his eyes again. He laid back on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You should go,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But I want to stay and take care of you tonight. You&rsquo;re drunk and the servants are asleep, I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish talking, she was interrupted by him. &ldquo;Go. Don&rsquo;t make me repeat myself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn gritted her teeth. She lost her only chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not dare to say anything more. She could only leave Brian&rsquo;s room in disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was the only person in the room now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lifted his hand and his long, lean fingers rubbed his temple. He was still a little drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did drink a little bit too much tonight. He was feeling agitated and frustrated for a reason he could not put his finger on. Was it because he saw Grace in the morning?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know why there were images of her riding away in her battery-powered bike in his brain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That woman was wanted by Jason, so he would not bother to fight him for her. After all, he did not want her. Even if he kept her with him, she would just be a replacement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When this question flashed across his brain, he felt a pang of pain in his chest. It was as if it was foreshadowing something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian chuckled absent-mindedly. He had drunk too much and that was why he was drunk!</p></div>
