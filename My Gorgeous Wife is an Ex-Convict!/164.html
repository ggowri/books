        <h1>Chapter 163</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If it was her, she wouldn't have cried."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had suddenly blurted out such a sentence, and she didn't know how to react for a second.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When her fear reached a certain level, she couldn't help but shout, "Who is it? Who is that woman?! Brian, the only person you love is 'her', right? But you'll never be able to get 'her'. If you don't care about other people's feelings, then sooner or later, 'she' will also stop caring about your feelings!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian suddenly stopped and turned around. He stared at Emily with his sharp eyes. At that moment, there was a bone-chilling frost in his usually cold eyes. He only gave her a glance before turning to leave.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emily suddenly fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian's gaze earlier made it seem as though he wanted to kill her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew that she was completely doomed!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace walked out of the restaurant. After feeling the cold wind on her skin, the burning sensation on her cheek eased up a little.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tonight had just been a farce.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, her phone rang. It was a relative from her mother's hometown calling. When she picked up, the relative immediately told her that her grandma had been hospitalized.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, your uncles and aunt, as well as your cousins are still being detained. According to the police, they will be sentenced to many years in jail if they go to court. If that happens, your grandmother won't even have anyone to see her off!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Basically, they wanted Grace to head to the police station to drop the charges and have the police release her detained relatives.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Even if it's just for your grandmother's sake, you should let them out!" the relative said. "Besides, no matter what, we are still relatives. We shouldn't go too far!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace thought it was ridiculous. This relative of hers, why didn't they talk about how her uncle and the others had tried to trick her?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, the only family that she recognized was her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the call ended, Grace hailed a taxi and told the driver to head to the address of the small county town where her relatives were.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Young lady, it's already so late; it's going to cost you an extra 300 to get there!" the driver said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I know, go ahead and drive," said Grace. No matter how much it cost, she was going to get to the hospital to see her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace arrived at the hospital and saw her grandmother lying on the sickbed with a tube attached to her body, she felt a tingling sensation in her nose. Her grandmother, who had been her only support, was now so weak. Her wrinkled face looked ashen as if her life was about to come to an end at any time.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her grandma had never told her about how her physical conditions had been deteriorating to such an extent.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What are you doing here? It's all your fault! You're the one who caused my mother to be like this!" The moment her aunt saw her, she cursed emotionally, as if she was going to pounce on her and tear her apart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her uncle quickly held her sister-in-law back and begged Grace, "Grace, you... why didn't you tell us that you'd gotten close with a big shot? This wouldn't have happened otherwise. We were only trying to marry you off to the Miller family for your own good. We wanted you to have someone to rely on for the rest of your life!"</p></div>
