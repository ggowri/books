        <h1>Chapter 3037</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Valda and Brian again. "Since we've coincidentally met, why don't we have a meal together? I also want to talk to Simon about his mother's situation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian and Jason didn't have any objections, so the group headed to the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In this shopping mall, there is a popular children's restaurant that Jasper really wants to go to. Mick Reed and William also have an attitude of liking it as long as Jasper likes it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And Simon, clearly, is also interested in this restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, no one raised any objections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After entering the restaurant and ordering some dishes, a few children started chatting away. Of course, Jasper was the most talkative, while Mick rarely spoke. William mostly followed Jasper's topics, and Simon would occasionally ask some questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper is clearly confident about her piano competition. Even though the results won't be out for a few days, she doesn't feel particularly drawn to any of the peers who participated in the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought I would never meet another kid who plays the piano as well as William," grumbled Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "So, do you really want to meet another kid who plays the piano really well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, if there is someone like that, I would definitely pull them along and play many wonderful pieces!" said Jasper. In fact, she wasn't too eager to win awards. What she really desired was to meet someone her age who played the piano well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William, who was sitting next to Jasper, lowered his gaze gently and his body stiffened slightly, almost imperceptibly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper, do you want to meet another child who plays the piano well?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Isn't he enough on his own?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A sudden panic arose in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If one day, another person who plays better than him appears beside her, would she like that person more?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she said he was a very important friend to her and that she really liked him, this panic was something deeply buried in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is playing the piano interesting?" Simon asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How interesting." Whenever the topic of piano comes up, Jasper naturally has an endless supply of things to talk about. He starts telling Simon stories about famous pianists and the beauty of playing the piano. He even mentions some unique ways of playing, which Simon Gregory finds quite fascinating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Simon, do you want to learn piano? I can give you a lot of sheet music! And I also have notes from when I learned piano as a child!" Although she called them notes, when Jasper was only 4 or 5 years old, those notes were really only understandable to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her enthusiasm made Simon feel a bit embarrassed to refuse. "Then next time, I'll try to learn it too. It seems like it would be fun to play together with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great, great!" Jasper nodded repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But suddenly, William Atkinson interjected, "You won't be able to learn it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon furrowed his brows, sensing a hint of hostility from William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, boys don't like to admit defeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who says I can't learn it? If I want to learn, I will definitely learn it!" Simon said confidently.</p></div>
