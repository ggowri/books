        <h1>Chapter 4362 Will It Change?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert pressed his lips together tightly, and after a good while, he finally said, "Alright, I'll give it a try!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Harley wasn't given charity, he should have temporarily set aside his inferiority complex and given this opportunity a shot!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the opportunity Harley had given him, and he had a hunch that he must seize it well. Otherwise, he might feel increasingly inferior in front of her for the rest of his life!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was too dazzling, too far out of his reach.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to get closer to her, he had to make some changes, rather than just accepting the unfairness that fate had dealt him without making any changes at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Go for it!" Harley said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a simple word of encouragement, yet it filled Calvert's heart with a wave of warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her kindness, and the smile she showed him made him irresistibly want to take a few more glances, wishing for her to reveal more smiles to him. For this, he could become even more diligent, striving to seize the opportunity she had given him!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, Harley received a call from the boss of the company where Calvert had interviewed for a modeling job.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Hart, the newcomer you recommended is quite impressive. They have strong comprehension and performance skills, and their physical appearance is also quite good. If we package them well, they could potentially become famous!" the other person said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, I'd appreciate it if you could look after him a bit," Harley said. "But I don't want him to receive any special treatment because of me. I hope he can prove himself with his own abilities."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I got it!" The other person kept agreeing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Harley understood that even though she had made such arrangements, Calvert, being her recommendation, would still receive some preferential treatment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, how far Calvert went depended on his own efforts. After all, some destinies could not be manipulated by power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a path that ordinary people could take to reach the clouds. But could Calvert do the same?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after this, Harley didn't see Calvert again. He only saw Calvert's photos in some magazines and heard his name mentioned occasionally in conversations among his schoolmates.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really didn't expect that the boy you saved back then has now become a model," Karen exclaimed. "I heard you even helped him get the job?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know?" Harley raised an eyebrow and asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen chuckled, "In that kind of circle, what secrets could there be? Besides, Calvert is starting to make a name for himself now. There are plenty of people who are jealous of him. Who knows, they might even drag you into it in the future!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just thought his looks were suited for this path, so I recommended a job to him. As for what happens next, that's his own business." She and Calvert, in the end, didn't really have much of a relationship, and she didn't want to concern herself with other people's lives.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you afraid he'll cling to you like a lifeline and refuse to let go?" Karen asked. After all, Harley is the princess of the entertainment industry! So many people are hoping to latch onto her, to gain more resources.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won't," Harley said, thinking of how Calvert had rejected her before. That kind of person would only want to rely on himself, not on others.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you can't do it now, you might be able to in the future. After all, people change," Karen said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley lowered his eyes, wondering if that </span><span>shy</span><span> yet prideful boy would ever change in the future?</span></p></div>
