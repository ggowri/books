        <h1>Chapter 370</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I do have some half-siblings that share the same father. My father has quite a few women, therefore he had more children.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney had not expected such an answer, so the atmosphere became rather awkward. They did not know how to continue the conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina immediately said without further thoughts, &ldquo;Mom, Dad, these are the affairs of the previous generation. His parents are his parents, he is himself!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin was rather surprised by Lina as he looked at her with a hint of warmth that even he did not realize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Sweeney reacted first and conceded. &ldquo;Indeed. Those were the affairs of past generations. So... Hadwin what are you working as?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I mainly manage a company,&rdquo; Hadwin replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Manage... a company?&rdquo; Mr. Sweeney looked at him in disbelief. He thought perhaps he had misheard him. &ldquo;What company do you manage? You&rsquo;re only 29 years old.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Mr. Sweeney, it was good enough if a 29-year-old young man could get a regular managerial position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for managing a company, he still found it rather implausible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve heard of Stephenson Group.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Sweeney was a man from a small suburb. He was not familiar with any famous shipping companies. However, he could tell the brand of cars from the logo within his suburb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Sweeney smiled awkwardly. &ldquo;Um... I haven&rsquo;t heard of it before. Is it a new company?&rdquo; After all, young people nowadays liked being entrepreneurs. It was not uncommon for them to build a new company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina felt more awkward than her dad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin said nothing but merely smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After chatting a while more, Lina wanted to find an excuse to send Hadwin off, but her parents asked him to stay for a meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that you have some things to settle in the office?&rdquo; Lina kept signaling him with her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This meal won&rsquo;t take much of my time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina was rendered speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&lsquo;Is he saying that he wants to stay for a meal?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the meal ended, Lina noticed that her parents wanted to chat further with Hadwin to get to know him further. Thus, she quickly said, &ldquo;Let me take him out for a stroll to digest our food.&rdquo; She did not waste any second in pulling Hadwin out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina finally heaved in relief once they reached the elevator. The meet-the-parents-day finally ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina could not help from exclaiming, &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t bring you out just now, my parents would probably ask about your ancestral tree as well. Earlier when my parents asked you those questions, you didn&rsquo;t need to answer with much detail. You could have just brushed them off with a simple answer.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly said, &ldquo;I think you wish that your parents aren&rsquo;t pleased with me. If that&rsquo;s the case, why did you say something like &lsquo;my parents are my parents, I am me&rsquo; kind of thing?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina was taken aback for a moment. She had said that out of the spur of the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;So... you don&rsquo;t wish that your parents dislike me?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze seemed to make her inexplicably flustered. &ldquo;I just felt that the deeds of the past generation should not be equated to you as a person. Don&rsquo;t overanalyze the meaning of what I said.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned her head away to avoid his gaze.</p></div>
