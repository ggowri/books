        <h1>Chapter 1101</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only knew that she had suffered a great deal in prison, but seeing her in such pain now gave him a better idea of what she had suffered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart was hurting, and it seemed that even breathing was painful at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had regretted coldly imprisoning her and even tacitly consenting to those people torturing her countless times, but not once was it as intense as it was now. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he was full of regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He crouched down, raised her hand, and kissed her fingertips. "I wish I had fallen in love with you before you went to prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His breeze-like voice sounded as if there was a lump in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How he wished he could reverse time. He wanted to appear in front of her before she went to prison. He would do everything in his power to clear her name and protect her from the slightest suffering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was too late now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked blankly at the man kissing her fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The warmth of his lips was felt on her fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body seemed to be burning too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was wrong," he murmured, interrupting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never admitted his mistakes in front of anyone, but now he said, "Grace, I was wrong. I should never have broken up with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Also... he should not have been indifferent toward her when she was being framed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she had seemed nothing more than a sacrifice and an unlucky person to him. It was his thoughtlessness at the time that caused her misery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason incredulously. 'Is he... apologizing?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I should&rsquo;ve believed you. I shouldn't have chosen betrayal because I was afraid that you would betray me. I was too selfish. I was so selfish I just wanted to keep myself from getting hurt and forgot to consider that you could get hurt as well." As he spoke, he put his hands around her hands, holding them just like how he used to warm them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands seemed to have gotten hotter. Grace was stunned. She could see guilt, regret, and pain on his face in front of her. It merged into a mixture of emotions she had never seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he now knelt in front of her could even be described as humble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace..." He gently called her name. "If I&rsquo;ll believe and listen to every word you say, and I won't doubt you, suspect you, not to mention betray you&hellip; Will you still love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His black eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's nose felt somewhat sore. She thought her heart was already at peace. She had gotten over him even when facing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his words stirred the waves in her heart again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can I love this man again? Can I love him as hard as I did last time and try to protect his rare fragility and make him feel more secure?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can an unforgettable love I tried hard to forget after being ruthlessly torn apart still exist?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help raising her hand and touching his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes suddenly lit up. Then, he laid his big hand gently on the back of hers, and his face brushed against her palm as if with endless affection. "Grace, love me. I won't let you down this time."</p></div>
