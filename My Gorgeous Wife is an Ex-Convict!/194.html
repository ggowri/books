        <h1>Chapter 193</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When times were good back then, she had made noise all day about wanting to lose weight, afraid that she would get fat and not look nice in certain clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have to worry about this anymore. She was thin now, and she would no longer worry over whether she would look nice in certain clothes or not. What she would consider now was the price and practicality of the clothes as well as whether or not they were durable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, when she thought about it sometimes, it was really funny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When you want something, you would desperately put in the effort to get it. When you finally get it, you then realize that the things you desperately wanted before were no longer the things the current you want.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed self-deprecatingly. Speaking of this, she really could not quite understand just why Jason would still call her &lsquo;sis&rsquo; every time he opened his mouth. It was like he still cared for her and missed the period of time they were together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he interested in her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, his actions seemed as if he liked her a lot, but she could not resist thinking, &lsquo;Is this also him acting?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head and stopped thinking about these. To her now, she could only take it one step at a time anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a rushed wash, she walked out of the bathroom only to notice that he was already sitting on the bed on the floor. Just like before, he waited for her to say goodnight before going to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked over and said awkwardly, &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo; After saying this, she hastily got in bed and burrowed in the covers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, she only wanted to fall asleep quickly so that she could get this night over with as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she closed her eyes, he leaned over and got closer to her to say, &ldquo;Sis, it seems that you haven&rsquo;t called me once this whole night. I want to hear you call me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her throat tightened. At this moment, if she were to turn over with her back facing him, that act would be too deliberate as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if she faced him&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What is it? Didn&rsquo;t you agree earlier that tonight will be just like the past?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lower lip. Back then, he was the only one acting. Now, he wanted it to become a two-man show?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Jason, goodnight.&rdquo; She finally spoke this name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ever since she knew that he was Jason till now, only a month had passed, but she felt as if a it was a long time&mdash;so long, it was like a whole lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled gently, then lowered his head slightly, getting even closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She understood what he meant. In the past, before they slept, she also liked to caress his hair. She always said that the quality of his hair was great and that she envied him for his hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she realized it, patting his head before sleeping had become a habit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This pose of his now was probably because he wanted her to pat his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gently laid her hand on Jason&rsquo;s head. Her finger dug into his hair a little, caressing his head just like before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in her heart, it was a completely different feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The top of his head rubbed against her palm, and he mumbled, &ldquo;As expected, being here with you still gives me a peace of mind, Sis.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt like he was provoking her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Peace of mind?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not feel any peace of mind because of his presence here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, after she patted his head, Jason returned to his covers and reached for the lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn it off!&rdquo; Grace said. When she met his probing gaze, she said a little uneasily, &ldquo;If you turn it off, I&rsquo;m afraid I&hellip; won&rsquo;t be able to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared thoughtfully for a moment, then smiled. &ldquo;Alright then. I&rsquo;ll leave the lights on.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She heaved a sigh of relief, laid down, and closed her eyes. After an unknown amount of time passed, his voice sounded once again. &ldquo;Sis, have you ever hated someone?&rdquo;</p></div>
