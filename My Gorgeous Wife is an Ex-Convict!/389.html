        <h1>Chapter 388</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that I was right the other day. It was you." Brian calmly glanced at Kyla Corbyn. "Did you come to beg me not to tell Martin Weiss about seeing you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's body shuddered when she heard the words &lsquo;Martin Weiss&rsquo;. She had not heard anyone mention this name for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was a name she loved and hated with all her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she just wanted to get away from the name completely and live a quiet life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I know I don't have the qualifications to talk to you. I just hope you can take pity on me and just forget that you ever saw me!" answered Kyla Corbyn after gritting her teeth. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tone was so humble that even if Brian asked her to kneel, she would not hesitate to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should know he has been searching for you all these years," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn pursed her lips and said nothing. The man was only searching for her because he thought she had not suffered enough and for escaping from the miserable path he had given her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was searching for her because she had unexpectedly &lsquo;disappeared&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please, Mr. Hart. You must know some of the stories between him and me. I just want to live in peace. I&rsquo;m not causing harm to anyone, nor do I want to be hurt," implored Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not causing harm?" Brian gave a lazy chuckle. "However, everyone seems to know that you caused Martin Weiss's girlfriend to have a miscarriage, killing a human life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn clenched her teeth and closed her eyes in despair. It was a stamp of guilt that was thrust upon her. Even though she had said many times over that she did not do it, no one believed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man she loved most sent her to prison himself. When she was taken away by the police, she asked, "Have you ever loved me, Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can I love you when I had nothing but hatred for you from the beginning? Kyla Corbyn, I want you to live your whole life in pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were the man's last words to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man she loved most wanted her to live her whole life in pain. What she thought had been his affection for her was nothing but hatred and revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she went to prison and heard that he was lovingly engaged to his girlfriend whereas she was just that wicked woman who was occasionally mentioned in the news. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; did not harm anyone!" Kyla Corbyn said with a trembling voice as if she was using the last bit of her strength to defend her innocence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Kyla Corbyn who was in front of him, Grace somehow flashed through Brian's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had investigated Grace's case and knew that Grace had also been to prison. The car accident back then&hellip; What he saw from the documents was that Grace had pleaded not guilty in court.</p></div>
