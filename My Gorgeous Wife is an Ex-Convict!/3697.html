        <h1>Chapter 3695</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these words, Angelica looked at Veronica's reaction again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica lowered her head and didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, you can leave now," Angelica dismissed Veronica. After Veronica left, a calculating look flashed in Angelica's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, this was a great opportunity for her to get close to the Reed family. Although there were some initial problems, as long as she made good use of this opportunity and climbed up to Mason of the Reed family, who would dare to look down on her in this circle in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she could spread some rumors with Mason, many resources would probably come continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Veronica, even if she really had something with Mason before, Angelica didn't care about her. After all, in Angelica's eyes, Veronica was far inferior to her, just an unremarkable assistant with no threat at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the library of Stanford University, a fashionable and beautiful figure walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Angelica didn't wear sunglasses or masks to cover her face like usual, just a hat that couldn't cover much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, someone had to recognize her for there to be a possibility of creating rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Stanford University was the best university in Emerald City, and the students there mostly focused on studying. Although some people recognized Angelica, there was no scene of people crowding around her like fans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica went to a corner of the library and saw Mason, who was sitting and reading the original text.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had inquired beforehand and knew that Mason was an exchange student here, now a junior, 18 years old, but had skipped two grades and was several years younger than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because of the indifference and coldness emanating from Mason that he didn't look like an 18-year-old, but much more mature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angelica didn't mind. After all, these days, it was popular for older women to date younger men. If she could really develop with Mason, it would be great. Even if she couldn't, as long as she could get some good feelings from this young man, she would have a place in the entertainment circle in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, we meet again," Angelica greeted Mason proactively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason gave her a cold glance and returned his gaze to his book.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica sat down beside him, oblivious to his indifference. "Don't you remember me? Backstage at the concert..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go away. I don't like unrelated people sitting next to me," Mason said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica's face showed a hint of embarrassment, but she smiled and said, "I came here today to return your suit." She took out the dry-cleaned suit from the elegant bag </span><span>Veronica had given her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mason didn't even look at it. He closed his book and stood up, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica reached out to grab him, but her hand came up empty.</span></p></div>
