        <h1>Chapter 1603</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason suddenly squeezed Grace's hand a little tighter. "Whatever it may be, since we've found Secretary Wang, we'll eventually find out the whereabouts of our child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if the child were dead, he would find out where he died!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay." Grace's voice was already choking with sobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two entered the house, where several other bodyguards were guarding a middle-aged man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It took Grace some time to recognize the middle-aged man as Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Five years had passed, and Secretary Wang was different from what she remembered. Although there were not many wrinkles on his face, his hair was a little gray. He had a mustache, wore a pair of glasses, and was dressed in ordinary casual clothes. He looked like an ordinary citizen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If Secretary Wang had passed by her on a normal day, she probably would not recognize him as the person she was looking for!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A hint of surprise flashed across Secretary Wang's eyes when he saw Grace and then he smiled. "So you've returned to the Reed family in the end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace took a deep breath. "Yes, I've returned to the Reed family." After five years, she had finally returned to the Reed family and Jay's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You all should leave first," Jason said to the subordinates in the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They answered him and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Where's the child?" Jason asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Child? Didn't I already give them to you? One to the Reed family, and one to your wife," said Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You know which child I mean!" Jason's voice grew colder. "Grace had triplets. We only have two. Where's the other one?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's good enough that two of the triplets survived. Young master Reed, do you expect all three to have survived?" Secretary Wang laughed mockingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stumbled a little. 'There's another child. Could they be...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is that child still alive or not?" She looked at Secretary Wang with red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if the answer was the last thing in the world she wanted to hear, as a mother, she needed to know!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Secretary Wang did not answer her but only looked at Jason. "It's been five years. Do you still plan to be with this woman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said coldly, "She's my wife and the mother of my children. It's a matter of course for me to be with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you love her?" Secretary Wang asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "What does it matter whether I love her or not? Why should I tell you? I can spare you if you tell me where the child is. Otherwise, you'll spend the rest of your life behind bars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang did not care what would happen to him. He only said, "You're the head of the Reed family. You shouldn't fall in love with anyone so that you won't have any weaknesses. Old Master was afraid you'd ruin the Reed family if you had a weakness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason walked over and grabbed Secretary Wang's collar. With a sneer, he said, "Even if I have no weakness, I can still ruin the Reed family. What's the matter? Are you still going to be Old Master's loyal lapdog after all these years?"</p></div>
