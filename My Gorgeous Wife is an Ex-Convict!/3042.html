        <h1>Chapter 3040</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He said he wants to learn piano, and I talked to him about many things related to piano, and he listened carefully," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So... if he learns to play the piano well in the future, you will like him more, won't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded her head slightly, saying that if Simon played the piano very well, she would definitely like him more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he plays better than me, would you like him more?" He spoke with possessiveness and unease in his tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This emotion is actually called jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper was thinking very seriously, while William was anxiously waiting, afraid that she would say the word "yes" out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The piano was his most powerful weapon in making her fall in love with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the very beginning, she fell in love with him because of his piano skills. So now, it seems only natural that she would fall in love with someone else because of their piano skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But besides the piano, what else does he have?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What else can he boast about? Does he have good grades or exam scores?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Or perhaps he is now the young master of the Barlow family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But it seems like she hasn't really cared about any of these things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if Simon plays better than William, I still prefer William," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William felt the tightness in his chest disappear all of a sudden. The small fist that he had tightly clenched by his side due to nervousness also relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she said, "because besides liking the piano that you play, I like many other things too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Other things?" he asked, looking puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You play dolls with me, and you always listen to me and are so well-behaved," she began counting on her fingers, listing all the things she liked about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And most importantly, William, you also like me very much! Of course, I will like you too! We promised to be forever good friends, right?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly felt a warm feeling in his heart, and his previous anxiety and fear slowly faded away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My favorite is Jasper, always!" he hugged her with all his might, as if she were the only floating wood in his world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper was stunned for a moment, then giggled and hugged William back, "I will always like William too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two little people hugged each other, giving each other warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were some things he understood too early, while she didn't understand at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">***</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a house outside the Barlow House, people inside were using a high-powered telescope to spy on the Barlow House.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to the Barlow House's security measures, they couldn't be too obvious and could only watch from the outside, afraid of being caught.</p></div>
