        <h1>Chapter 2000</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry!" said Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was silent. Eight million dollars was more than the average person could earn in a lifetime. It was a good price to see through someone&rsquo;s heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, Anthony Sherman is right in front of you. What do you want me to do with him?" Hadwin Stephenson's voice rang in her ears. "Shall we ruin his reputation or put him in jail? Even though his post didn't name anyone, eight million dollars is enough to sentence him. Or do you want him to suffer other kinds of punishment? Tell me and I'll do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could be a sharp sword that would go after anyone who had hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman's face turned gloomy as if he had expected it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at Anthony Sherman quietly. After a long while, she said, "You saved my baby and me once. When I had a car accident, you were the first to run over and send me to the hospital. I remember your kindness, so I'll just repay that with this. From now on, we're even! And we're no longer friends!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman's lips quivered as if he wanted to say something, but he said nothing in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at Lina and said, "Since you want things to be even, then so be it." With that said, he ordered the bodyguard guarding Anthony Sherman nearby, "You don't have to guard here any longer. Mr. Stephenson is a free man now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he took Lina's hand and said, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina nodded and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina!" Anthony Sherman eventually cried out in a heavy voice. "I won't hurt you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina did not reply but followed Hadwin Stephenson back to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was silent all the way. She looked down at her bulging belly in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That night, Anthony Sherman posted a clarification stating that someone paid him eight million dollars to frame Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would donate all the money to charity. He also stated that while he did get to know Lina through a blind date, they had always been friends. Nothing beyond friendship had ever happened between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He felt deeply sorry to his former friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not a long post, and the comments below it were full of various criticisms. Of course, some people also speculated about the identity of the person who paid him eight million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina saw the post, she could not help asking Hadwin Stephenson, "Did you make him post this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, he posted it himself. Of course, the police would&rsquo;ve released a statement in a few days even if he hadn't," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" Lina froze. "But... But didn't we say to make it even?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson smiled faintly. "You made it even with him, but I didn&rsquo;t plan to make it even with the people who have framed you. It seems he's not that bad after all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said hesitantly, "Then are you..."</p></div>
