        <h1>Chapter 3515</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once upon a time, she meant everything to him. His joys and sorrows seemed to revolve around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His father once told him, "Putting all your emotions into one person is a gamble. If you win, it could lead to a lifetime of happiness. But if you lose, it could be a disaster."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now... is he facing a disaster?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought she would at least believe him, but she easily trusted him and even participated in the kidnapping case, and was even one of the initial planners.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her lack of trust made him feel like he was falling into an abyss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He realized that perhaps for him, putting all his emotions on her was a disaster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he wanted to leave, to leave this place, afraid that if he didn't, he wouldn't be able to control himself from seeing her, and then...maybe his pain would only increase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really going abroad?" Last night, after he told his parents about his plan to go abroad, his father asked him this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm, I want to go abroad," he said. "As for the kidnapping case, I will come back when it's time to testify in court."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you suddenly want to go abroad? Is it related to Veronica?" Grace asked. After all, her son went out with Veronica today to the Barlow family, but when he came back, he was the only one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, this is between her and me. I don't want anyone to interfere, so you don't need to bother her or say anything to her. Tomorrow, I will leave Emerald City. I want to be quiet outside for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I'm not a kid anymore. I know what I'm saying and doing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he said this sentence, his mother didn't say anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The plane began to taxi and was about to take off. Jasper's finger pressed on the phone screen, and he finally deleted "Veronica" from his contacts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From now on, she is no longer his Veronica!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he doesn't have to be so painful anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she can't trust him, can't really treat him as the most important person, and just keeps treating him like a brother, then for him, it will only become more and more painful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And his emotions will only become more and more out of control, and may even...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, completely rejecting her is the best thing for him or for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, you are no longer the most important person to me!" he murmured, closing his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The plane soared into the sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, parting ways can be so easy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica opened her eyes, she saw a white ceiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking around, she realized that she was in a hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How did she end up in a hospital?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Jasper walked into the room as the door opened. He breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing Veronica awake. "Veronica, thank goodness you're awake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened to me before?" she murmured, but her throat was dry and had a burning sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have a fever. The doctor just gave you a shot to bring it down. If you take some medicine later, you should be fine," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you so much," Veronica said. Suddenly, she seemed to remember something and her face changed dramatically. "Oh, and Mason...," she trailed off.</p></div>
