        <h1>Chapter 1212</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had not been easy for him to find out about all of this in half an hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's expression froze a little. 'She stood in front of Brian's mansion all night last night?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed, Miss Cummins stood there the entirety of last night and now she&rsquo;s standing out here. I'm afraid she won't be able to hold out much longer, given her strength," Terrence could not help but say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason turned his head and once again looked down at the black speck in front of the building through the French window. "Go and bring her up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Terrence quickly replied and speed-walked out of the president's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It seems that Master Reed still cares about Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time Terrence got downstairs, Grace was almost on the verge of collapsing. She was barely hanging on with her last ounce of willpower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins, Master Reed wants to see you. Come with me," said Terrence. Looking at the woman before him who was in dire straits, he could not help sighing in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With Master Reed's love for her, as long as she yielded to him, he would naturally help her solve the current dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay. Sorry for the trouble," Grace parted her dry lips and answered. Her voice sounded almost as if it was packed with sand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace followed Terrence into the company&rsquo;s building, some employees looked at the scene in amazement while others who had never met Grace were wondering about her identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Grace had already attracted quite a few people's attention by standing outside for so long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence took Grace to the president's office and gently knocked on the door before opening it. He said to Grace, "Miss Cummins, please!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's hands that were by her sides were slightly clenched into fists as if to motivate herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She entered the office, more nervous than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace walked into the office, there was the sound of the door closing behind her. A tall figure stood in front of her, and he was in front of the French window not far away. She looked up and met his deep black eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason nervously. Yes, she was nervous. She was afraid that if she said or did something wrong, Jason would not lend her the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was worried because the money concerned Lina's life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was going to borrow the money for Lina no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she said, "I... I know my request today was presumptuous, but I can only look for&hellip; you. I don't know what else to do except to come and borrow the money from you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you borrowing the money to help save Lina?" said Jason. The cold voice was pleasant, but it sounded harsh to those who heard it.</p></div>
