        <h1>Chapter 2817</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took a tissue and wiped the tears on her face. "I really didn't know you'd have such a big reaction. It seems I was too opinionated and self-assertive. Let me take you back now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said while wiping away her tears. He then restarted the car to turn around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't." She pressed her hand on the back of his hand on the gear stick and took a deep breath as she stared straight ahead. "I... I want to go to the canyon." She wanted to finish the unfinished journey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never been there, but... did that also mean she had never let herself move on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew Brian wanted her to move on, and she wanted to do it too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her parents would also be happier if she were happier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at Valda Theller's red and swollen eyes. "Are you sure you want to go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I&rsquo;d like to see the canyon for myself and also my parents," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes flickered. After pondering for a moment, he said, "Okay, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car continued driving toward the canyon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they finally arrived at the destination, Valda Theller looked at the flowing stream and the greenery around. She let out a long gasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was... the canyon she finally arrived at a dozen years later. If the accident had never happened, she and her parents would have spent a happy day here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to go down for a walk?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." She nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and Brian got out of the car and walked down the avenue to the stream. There were natural rocks of different shapes along the road. The water was clear, and there were many tourists even though it was not a holiday or weekend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The stream was shallow as it was below the ankles. The weather was comfortable, so many tourists took off their shoes and played in the stream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the clear stream water, Valda Theller remembered her mom describing the fun of the canyon to Valda Theller. She also said she would take Valda Theller to walk in the stream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly turned to Brian and said, "I want to go in the water for a while. Will you wait for me here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Brian said without objection. After all, there was nothing dangerous about playing in the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took off her shoes and socks. Then, she bent over to roll up her pants. She walked into the stream with her bare feet. The cool stream water washed her feet, making her feel relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at nature and breathing in the air, Valda Theller only found her heavy mood lightening gradually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked step by step in the stream, and it felt comfortable to have her feet step on the smooth pebbles. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The laughter of other tourists, couples, and families was all around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at a little girl with her parents not far away. Small fish would occasionally swim past them, and the family of three tried catching the fish. The little girl eventually seemed exhausted from standing, so her father lifted her high to let her sit on his shoulders.</p></div>
