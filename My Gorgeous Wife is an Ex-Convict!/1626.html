        <h1>Chapter 1624</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Now, you have the Stephenson family and are living the life you wanted, which also proves that you made the right choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"My life isn't hard. I have friends and family who love me. They were there for me when I was in pain, and now my life has gone back to normal. In the future, I'll get married, have children, and have a normal but happy life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So I don't hate you. I just want to get over you. Maybe when we're old and surrounded by children and grandchildren, we can smile at each other if we ever meet on the streets. Wouldn't that be nice?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She whispered. Her tone was calm as if she were merely telling a story, but his heart ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her lack of hatred only deepened his pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had always felt that meeting her and falling in love with her was the best thing that ever happened to him. She was so nice that she was even considerate of him after their breakup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had stopped her from leaving Emerald City and not been overconfident, or perhaps if he had been better prepared&hellip; would they not have ended up like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina..." he mumbled as he slowly looked down, unable to stop himself from approaching her and touching her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the doorbell suddenly rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were in a hotel room right now. As both of them had gotten caught in a mess earlier, he took her straight to the nearest hotel and got a room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sound of the doorbell seemed to pull Hadwin Stephenson back from his trance. He stepped back awkwardly, then turned to the door and opened it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Hadwin Stephenson's subordinate outside. He respectfully handed over two sets of clothes. "Mr. Stephenson, these are the clothes you wanted. They're in the sizes you mentioned."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson took the clothes, walked over to Lina, and handed the women's clothes to her. "Go get changed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No thanks. I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you want to go home in your dirty clothes and have your parents ask you what happened?" Hadwin Stephenson interrupted her and said, "If you&rsquo;re afraid to get involved with me, then you shouldn't have entered a hotel room with me. Don't you think it's a little late to avoid arousing suspicion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina pressed her lips together and thought of her parents' nagging. She said, "I'll transfer you the money for these clothes later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There's no need for that," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's better not to owe each other money," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina took the clothes and went into the bathroom to get changed, while Hadwin Stephenson stood where he was. He could not help smiling bitterly with his head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had tried to get her to say that she hated him, thinking it might crush his ideas, longing, and desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because he did not even have the right to touch her now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, all she said was... she did not hate him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Haha... Hahaha..." Hadwin Stephenson laughed softly, but it was very depressing&mdash;full of pain and self-mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she hated him, then perhaps he could love her less...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina... Lina..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He muttered her name. They were so close, but he could not get close to her!</p></div>
