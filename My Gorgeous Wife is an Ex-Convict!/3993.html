        <h1>Chapter 3991</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong scent of perfume emanating from the woman filled Mick's nostrils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so different from the scent on Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it, even at this moment, he still thinks of her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really willing to do anything for me?" Mick asked the woman in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see too much makeup on her gorgeous face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy, on the other hand, only wore light makeup, which made her more pleasing to his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," the woman quickly assured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then hug me," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was stunned again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had prepared herself for the possibility of Mick making demanding requests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the young master of the Reed family only asked her to hug him?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, don't want to?" Mick asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no!" The woman quickly reached out and hugged Mick, afraid that he would change his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, not only the woman, but also the people around them were stunned by Mick's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone saw the woman's hands wrapped around Mick's waist, leaning against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick lowered his head and rested it on the woman's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stand still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Have you ever seen the Reed family's young master holding a woman like this in such a situation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people immediately felt envious and jealous, thinking that this woman might have gained a higher status because of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the woman's heart couldn't stop beating rapidly, feeling like she might have just hit the jackpot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Mr. Reed took the initiative to hold her, then he must be interested in her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the woman was still caught up in her excitement when Mick's voice suddenly rang in her ear, "That's enough, let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reed, what are you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said that's enough, you can let go now!" Mick said impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman reluctantly let go, her face full of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick didn't even look at her, pouring himself a glass of wine from a nearby bottle and downing it in one gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he feel nothing but disgust during the embrace just now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had wanted to use this hug to drive Nancy's image out of his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why did it make Nancy's image even clearer in his mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reed, if you didn't like the hug just now, I can..." The woman didn't finish her sentence before Mick's face darkened. "Did you not hear what I said earlier? Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman looked lost, her previous pride now replaced with defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left the private room dejectedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, other women were eager to try their luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Mick had let the previous woman hug him, so she must not have pleased Mr. Reed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed they could do better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when these women approached him, Mick impatiently said, "I want to be alone, so everyone leave now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at each other and no one dared to stay in the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick was left alone in the room, finally able to catch his breath in the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he laughed. The laughter was clear and heavy in the quiet room.</span></p></div>
