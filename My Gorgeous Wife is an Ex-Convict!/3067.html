        <h1>Chapter 3065</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a small village downstream of Deer Capital, there lies a simple house where an unconscious woman is lying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A woman's leg is in a cast, and an elderly woman is taking care of her, helping her turn over and wiping her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the old woman finished taking care of the unconscious woman and then left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, Lisa, did that woman you found wake up?" asked someone from the same village curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lisa shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why hasn't she woken up yet? She's been in a coma for over three months," said a villager. "Is she now what people call a vegetable? Why did you choose to pick up someone like her? If she never wakes up, you'll have to take care of her for the rest of your life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lisa sighed and said, "I'll just consider it as if God has given me another daughter to take care of, so I'll raise her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The villagers all know that Lisa's husband died many years ago, and she relied on her daughter for companionship. However, when her daughter was ten years old, she accidentally drowned in the river.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From then on, Lisa was left all alone. Her most frequent destination was the river where her daughter drowned. She would often burn paper offerings by the riverbank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that over three months ago, Lisa found an unconscious woman by the river, and the woman's leg was even broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lisa spent a lot of her savings to bring an old village doctor from a nearby village to treat the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the woman's legs are in casts, she has been unconscious the whole time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, many people in the village are saying that Lisa is a burden and that her family now has an "undead" person living with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people even encouraged Lisa to throw the woman out, saying that she wouldn't wake up anyway, so what's the difference between that and being dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lisa persisted and refused to give up. She said that even if the person couldn't wake up, their life was still valuable and couldn't be discarded so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Furthermore, this woman was found in the river, which made Lisa feel even more like it was her deceased daughter coming back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lisa went to the old village doctor again to get the medicine. She cooked it in a clay pot and carefully fed it to the woman lying unconscious in bed, one spoonful at a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When will you wake up? Everyone says you won't wake up, but I don't believe that. As long as my wife is alive, I will take care of you. It's up to your luck whether you can wake up before my wife passes away." Lisa muttered to herself, unaware that the woman lying unconscious beside her had twitched her left pinky finger slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A year's time has quickly passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During this year, for some people, it was just an ordinary year, but for others, it was a year of significant change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe and Whitney have been sentenced to life imprisonment, and anyone who knows the details knows that these two will not have a chance of parole. They may even suffer various forms of torture while in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But no one sympathizes with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Patrick, who had some acquaintance with Phoebe, never spoke up to plead for her even a little bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone knows that the current crown prince is colder and more melancholic than ever before. He always has a piece of rag wrapped around his right wrist, but few people know what it is or what it means.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just beside him, there was one less person, a girlfriend he had once admitted to having!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three characters of "Valda" have become a taboo in front of him, and others cannot mention it.</p></div>
