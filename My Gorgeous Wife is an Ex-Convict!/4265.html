        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina sighed and wiped her daughter's tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to say, it's okay. But Mom wants you to be happy. Whatever the problem is, I'm your mother and I will stand by your side!" Lina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she was her daughter's biggest support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina continued to cry while tears streamed down her face. She choked out, "Mom, I don't know why I feel so sad. He already promised to divorce, he didn't say anything hurtful, and he agreed to all my requests. But why am I so sad, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina cried and found it hard to catch her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina gently patted her daughter's back. "Tina, Mom just hopes that whatever decision you make, you won't regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because in this world, there are things that can be regretted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But some things can't be regretted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one day Tina recovers her memories, will she regret the decisions she's made now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, even without her memories, Tina might still end up regretting it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Tina was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know if she would regret it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she knew was that she was feeling very sad right now, a pain as if her soul was being torn apart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler returned to the villa where he and Tina had planned to get married. Many things here were arranged by Tina, and it was filled with her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divorce?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that finding Tina, knowing that she was still alive, would be the beginning of happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he never expected that it would be the start of a different kind of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trust and love they once had had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person in front of him, though she was Tina, she was no longer his Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tina suggested that they should get along well, he was genuinely happy. He felt that there was hope again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that hope shattered so quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler laughed bitterly. Now, he was only going from one pain to another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at least, Tina is still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had prayed before, that as long as Tina was still alive, he would do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it's just a matter of fulfilling his wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it's painful, the fact that she's alive brings him comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few days, Chandler saw Tina again. He stared at her almost greedily. She looked even more haggard than the last time he saw her. She had just recovered from a serious illness, and now she looked fragile as if a gust of wind could knock her over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the divorce agreement that my lawyer drafted. You can take a look," Tina took out a divorce agreement and handed it to Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler took it, but instead of looking at it, he picked up a pen and was about to sign the agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Tina quickly stopped him. "Are you going to sign it just like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm," he replied softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would give her everything she wanted, whether it was the agreement or anything else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you don't even want to take a look. Aren't you afraid that I might harm you? Aren't you afraid that the terms of the agreement might be unfavorable to you?" Tina asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay," Chandler said quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because for him, many things are no longer important!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, I will give you everything you want," Chandler said softly. He picked up the pen, signed the agreement, and handed it to her!</span></p></div>
