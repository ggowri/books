        <h1>Chapter 4061</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, he just wanted to teach her a lesson, to let her know that some words and actions shouldn't be taken lightly when it comes to giving away one's body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He deliberately made such a move, thinking that she would be scared and, with her personality, would at least calm down for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But unexpectedly, the one who learned the lesson was him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he kissed her just now, he almost couldn't control himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, if she paid a little more attention, she should have noticed the change in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You...will you never be afraid of me?" Chandler looked at Tina and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm." She responded with a very affirmative tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if in the future, you see the scary side of me, you won't be afraid?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You won't hurt me, so why should I be afraid?" she asked strangely, "I heard from my mom that my dad also has a scary side, but my mom never feared my dad!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And if her mom was unhappy, she dared to kick her dad off the bed and pull his ears!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She still remembers asking her mom if she wasn't worried about her dad getting angry?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, her mom smiled and said, "Your dad loves me so much, how could he get angry with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later, she summed it up. Her mom was arrogant because of her dad's love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But who made her dad spoil her mom? So, her mom had the capital to be arrogant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, shall we continue?" Tina asked shamelessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler suddenly raised his hand and touched his forehead, "You...you go to sleep first, I still have some work to do!" After speaking, he hurriedly left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leaving Tina with a puzzled look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Uh...did Chandler just...run away?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be that she's just not attractive enough, or maybe he still sees her as a child, so he can't make a move?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, tonight was just supposed to be a test to see if she really loved him, but now... she's the one who ran away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But, well, she doesn't mind kissing him, or him kissing her body, even more intimate actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even kind of likes it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the conclusion is, she must love him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hmm, then next time, she'll find a chance to "eat" him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like Mommy did back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mommy ate Daddy first back then, so he wouldn't be taken away by other women!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina lay in bed, thinking about how to "eat" Chandler next time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Chandler didn't go to the study like he said he would, but instead went to the bathroom for a cold shower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body was telling him that his pride in his self-control was almost shattered in front of her. If she had continued to hold onto him earlier, he might have really done something to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina!" He murmured her name, desperately suppressing his desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a long time, he wiped himself off, put on a bathrobe, and walked to the sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the mirror, his face still had a rare blush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And all of this was because of Tina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But... in the future, even if she learns about Hunter's secret and knows why he chose her back then, will she still be completely unafraid of him like she is now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If one day she looks at him with fearful eyes, can he bear it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> People are always like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If they have never tasted the sweetness and have always been in hell, then they won't find hell terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But if they have tasted the sweetness, they will crave it more and won't be able to bear the pain anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, I hope you will never be afraid of me in the future!" Chandler said in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There was an undiscovered anxiety in his eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> ...</p></div>
