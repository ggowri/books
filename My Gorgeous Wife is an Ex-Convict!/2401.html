        <h1>Chapter 2399</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was in no hurry to speak, but a voice beat her to it and said, "She doesn't have to lie. She can have as many luxury clothes and jewelry like these as she wants!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This voice...' Grace froze. The people around her looked up, and surprise flickered in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crown prince of the entertainment industry... was defending this woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not anyone could make the crown prince of the entertainment industry say such a thing. Could the woman have some unusual background?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around in a daze and looked behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a tall figure in a gray suit and a white shirt. He looked elegant and gentle. The handsome face and beautiful phoenix eyes attracted the attention of women around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When those phoenix eyes gently looked up, one would not be able to stop thinking about the scene. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pair of phoenix eyes did not have their usual indifference and estrangement but contained a look of gentleness instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the man who approached her, never expecting to meet him on such an occasion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Long time no see, Grace." The melodious voice gently escaped from his mouth. He only found out how much he missed her as soon as he saw her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he had found someone who looked similar to her, so what?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only looking for a substitute like what he used to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, do you know her?" Whitney Herrera asked. After all, she used to be in the entertainment industry. How could she not know the crown prince of the entertainment industry? Besides, she had recently decided to make a comeback. It was time for her to build good relations with the crown prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She attended the party tonight because she heard the crown prince was attending!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've known her for years. She's an important friend of mine," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the crown prince said that, no one around Grace suspected that Grace's outfit was fake. After all, the crown prince's friends were either rich or aristocratic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd began curiously speculating Grace's identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was the most embarrassed of all. She looked at Grace standing next to Brian in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The woman is... the crown prince's friend!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not have to say anything as someone started defending her. "Ah, I knew it. How could someone like Miss Cummins have an agenda?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, you can tell Miss Cummins's gown and jewelry are genuine. Some people just can&rsquo;t recognize them and think they're fake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The mistake is excusable. After all, I heard that Mrs. Gregory was brought up outside, so she doesn't know much. The eldest heiress of the Mitchell family wouldn&rsquo;t be so ignorant if she were here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's expression instantly changed when the person mentioned the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family. Hardly anyone would mention that phrase after so many years had passed.</p></div>
