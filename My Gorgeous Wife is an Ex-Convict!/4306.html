        <h1>Chapter 4304 Meeting Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes later, Tina finally entered the Hunter family mansion and arrived at the main hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter was sitting in the front, and below him on the left were Colin and Adele.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina approached and politely greeted, "Hello, grandfather. Hello, mom and dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were not divorced, so it was normal to address them this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter looked at Tina. "You and Chandler really haven't divorced?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Tina answered firmly. "If you don't believe it, you can check. It's not something I can fake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter remained </span><span>silent,</span><span> his eyes fixed on Tina as if scrutinizing her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele spoke up, "Since you haven't divorced, what is the situation between you and Chandler?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was a misunderstanding," Tina said, feeling a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Misunderstanding? What kind of misunderstanding?" Adele asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought... he didn't love me that much, but now, I believe that he truly loves me, and I also love him. So, I want to reconcile with him," Tina said bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not beating around the bush, but openly expressing her feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele was taken aback by Tina's words and couldn't respond for a moment. Colin looked at Tina, "Your memory..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hasn't recovered," Tina said, then added, "But it doesn't prevent me from falling in love with him again. After all, Chandler is someone I once loved, so it's not strange for me to fall in love with him again, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three members of the Hunter family looked at each other, unsure how to react to Tina's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the old Mr. Hunter cleared his throat and coughed a few times. "You truly love Chandler?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Tina answered with utmost certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter sighed helplessly and asked the servants to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, in the main hall, there were only Tina and the three members of the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know about the curse of the Chandler's parasite. To lift the curse, you need to have another child with him. Are you willing to have another child?" the old Mr. Hunter stared at Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the old Mr. Hunter's gaze, Tina didn't flinch or hesitate. "I am willing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really willing?" Adele suddenly became excited and rushed to Tina's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He loves me, and I love him. Why wouldn't I be willing to have another child with him to relieve his suffering? Unless..." Tina paused. "Unless he doesn't love me anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could Chandler not love you!" Adele immediately said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his own mother, how could she not know!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless he doesn't love her, otherwise, loving someone means loving them for a lifetime. During the time Tina was missing, her son almost risked his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina smiled. "So, I will have a child with him. I will definitely help him lift the curse. Mom, let me see him first, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..." Adele hesitated and turned to look at the old Mr. Hunter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter asked, "Does Chandler know about your decision today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he knows," Tina replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't agree, did he?" the old Mr. Hunter asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina smiled awkwardly and said, "No, he rejected me. He thinks I'm pitying him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you?" the old Mr. Hunter asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not. If I give money to someone, it might be out of pity, but I won't have a child out of pity for anyone!" Tina said firmly.</span></p></div>
