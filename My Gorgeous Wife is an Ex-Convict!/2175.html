        <h1>Chapter 2173</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Yeah! We can sneak him out!' Jasper accepted Mick Reed's suggestion and smiled a little. Then, she became frustrated. "But how do we know where William's daddy took him? If Daddy and Mommy take us to William, they won't let us smuggle William back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then we'll go by ourselves." Mick Reed gave his sister a reassuring look. "I&rsquo;ll find out where William is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper Reed's eyes were full of trust. "Thank you, Brother!" With that said, she gave him a kiss on the cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed touched his cheek where he was kissed. 'Umm... It feels good to get a kiss from my sister.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, he loved how his sister had looked at him with trusting eyes just now! Since he was the elder brother, he would try his best to help her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William followed Philip Barlow to the Barlow family&rsquo;s house in Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although the noble Barlow family was wealthy, they had few family members. It had always been a problem for the family. Philip Barlow was also not interested in relationships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Charlie Barlow and Chelsea only wanted their son to get a wife when it was almost time. They had no requirements for her family background and social status. They just wanted to have someone to carry on the Barlow family&rsquo;s bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, someone unexpectedly harmed their son and caused him to become infertile. It was a devastating blow to the old couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chelsea even cried every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, every cloud had a silver lining. Their son found out that he might have a child out there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, he tracked it to Lily. He later took William's blood for a DNA test, and he turned out to be an heir of the Barlow family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The old couple was so thankful that they worshipped all the deities in Deer City and instantly wanted to go to Emerald City to fetch their grandson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow was afraid that having too many people over would make the kid panic, so he let the old couple stay in Deer City while he picked up the kid himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Their precious grandson had finally arrived at the Barlow family&rsquo;s house. Charlie Barlow and Chelsea were smiling from ear to ear as they held their precious grandson in their arms. They spoke about feeding him and how he had suffered with teary eyes. Then, they started talking about how William looked like Philip Barlow when he was a kid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked blankly at the two kind-looking elders in front of him. 'Are these... my grandparents?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They were unlike his maternal grandparents, whom he had met once before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When his maternal grandparents saw him, they were disgusted with him, but his paternal grandparents seemed to... like him a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Here, here, here. This is a present for you, William. May you live a long life and be always safe," said Chelsea as she took out a longevity lock. It was made of solid gold and had exquisite workmanship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chelsea put the longevity lock on William's neck, while Charlie Barlow summoned all the servants to the main hall. He said in front of everyone, "This is your little young master William. If any of you dare to neglect or fool him, don't blame me for being strict on you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The servants immediately turned to William and greeted respectfully, "Little Young Master!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, Chelsea took William to see the room they had prepared for him. It was much bigger than the room he had in the Reed family&rsquo;s house. The furniture was decorated in a style that little boys nowadays liked. There was a playroom next door with many toys in it.</p></div>
