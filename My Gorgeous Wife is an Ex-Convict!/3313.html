        <h1>Chapter 3311</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her blushing face and couldn't help but smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Valda was sometimes contradictory. She was the one who asked him to undo the buttons, but now she was too embarrassed and blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at the same time, she couldn't help but look at him with her eyes, making it hard for him to focus on his work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Didn't she know how attractive she looked right now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian stood up and walked over to Valda. "Don't look at me like that, I won't be able to resist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face suddenly turned several shades of red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I didn't make any particular expression," she stuttered, to indicate that she really didn't intentionally seduce him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You being like this now is a test for me," he said. "If you really want me to dress more revealingly, then don't pick on me when I'm working, okay? That way, you can draw me however you want, even if it means sacrificing myself for art."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words immediately set her mind racing with thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does she really want to dedicate herself to art...? "You... You're not asking me to draw you in your most unadorned state, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used a more artistic expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As long as you want to draw, there's nothing you can't do," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda feels like he's about to have a nosebleed just thinking about it. He has an amazing physique - broad shoulders, narrow waist, long and lean legs, with just the right amount of muscle without being too exaggerated. If she were to draw him completely and accurately...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stop, stop, we can't keep thinking about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If we keep going, she probably won't be able to sleep tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Never mind," Valda thought for a moment, "if I paint it, I won't be able to bear to destroy it, but if I keep it, I don't want to risk someone seeing it one day. Anyway, your body can only be seen completely by me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she said this sentence with some rare dominance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he actually liked her dominance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, only you can see it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, after Brian kissed Valda, he returned to his seat to work. However, at this moment, he had unbuttoned several buttons and almost half of his chest was exposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian could only be grateful that there were no video conferences or anything tonight, otherwise he would probably cause a stir again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was drawing with great enthusiasm and finally finished after more than an hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was quite satisfied with her finished drawing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She yawned and put away her writing tools.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Feeling tired?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, a little bit," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you should go to bed first," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I still have some work to do," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How about I keep you company?" she suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're so sweet, but you should go to bed. Pregnant women shouldn't stay up late," he said. "Once I'm done, I'll come back to our room. If you stay up with me, I'll be too worried to focus on my work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, then hurry up and finish your work. Come back to our room soon," she grumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Got it," he said. He walked her back to their room before returning to his study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the study, the sketch she just drew is still on the easel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He walked up to her and looked at the image of himself she had drawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gentle and graceful, with a slight smile on her lips, she sits casually in a chair, holding a pen in one hand and propping her chin up with the other, her gaze directed towards the artist.</p></div>
