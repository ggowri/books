        <h1>Chapter 3872</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, the soup isn't hot." Veronica said, which was fortunate. She stood up, stared angrily at Cato and said, "Who do you think you are? Can you just do this to others?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You bumped into the soup in my hand. What's it got to do with me?" Cato lied with his eyes open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica obviously understood that the other party was a rogue. She was about to say something else when suddenly the nausea in her stomach became stronger. She instinctively covered her mouth, picked up her bag, and hurried towards the restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, Veronica, wait!" Shirley quickly followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the two left, Cato spat and proudly said, "This kind of woman needs to be taught a lesson, and she will naturally leave obediently. Alright, let's sit down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The others echoed, but another male student did not sit down. He hesitated and said, "Cato, the woman you splashed soup on just now...I...I think I've seen her before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seen her before? What, have you met her before?" Cato said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...I need to check." The other person said, and actually took out his phone and started searching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato asked strangely, "What, don't tell me that woman is some kind of celebrity? She doesn't look like one!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the male student suddenly whispered, "Yes, it's her! Oh my god!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on? Who is she?" Other people crowded around the boy's phone to see the search results.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After looking at the phone, the faces of those people began to look unpleasant. After a moment, they looked up at Cato with a strange expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was both awkward and sympathetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato felt a little uneasy being looked at like that. "Why do you all have that expression? Who is that girl?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato's girlfriend, the girl who had a conflict with Veronica at first, had an almost crying expression after seeing the search results on the phone. "What should we do? Why is it her? How could she come to the school cafeteria to eat, and she's not even wearing any famous brands? Who can recognize her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But in school, it seems that many people can recognize her..." Another girl timidly said. When they were arguing here just now, the other people in the cafeteria didn't come forward, but they all looked over here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people were even whispering constantly, presumably they had already recognized the identity of the other party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato impatiently took the phone from his friend's hand and looked at the content of the search on the phone. "Who is it? Why are you making such a fuss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice stopped abruptly because at this moment, he had also seen the content on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was... a photo. The photo showed Veronica and Mason being photographed at school, and the title was "Saw the Reed family's Mason and his girlfriend, they are really from our school!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato could confirm at a glance that the woman in the photo was the woman he had just spilled soup on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This woman... is the girlfriend of the Reed family's Mason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family's Mason, could it be the one he was thinking of... "The Reed family"?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Cato looked at the man who had searched the phone at the beginning with guilty eyes. "Which one is this 'The Reed family'?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's the richest family in our Emerald City, The Reed family." The other person replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato's heart suddenly skipped a beat, and his face became extremely ugly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the woman just now was really the girlfriend of the Reed family's Mason, what would be the consequences of his behavior just now? At this moment, he almost dared not continue to imagine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p></div>
