        <h1>Chapter 3820</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw the footage taken by the drone, she felt anxious, trembling, scared, relieved, and...admiration!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, admiration!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She admired her son for choosing to enter alone to save people in such a dangerous situation, and she also admired Veronica for choosing to stay and move the stones that were pressing on Mason, even though she could have escaped first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two children clearly loved each other so much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they were already close to the entrance, and the security guards and police officers risked their lives to seize the last opportunity before the explosion to rush in and bring the two of them out together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the timing had been a little worse, everyone might have died inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Grace still felt lingering fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Veronica finally saw Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More precisely, she saw Mason while lying in her own hospital bed, which had been moved to Mason's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Mason's room was large enough, so adding her bed didn't make it feel </span><span>crowded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bed was placed next to Mason's bed, so she could see him just by turning her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was still unconscious after the surgery, with bandages on his head and gauze on his hands and feet outside the thin hospital blanket. One of his legs was also in a cast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since he wasn't in the ICU, there shouldn't be any major problems, Veronica thought to herself. As long as he didn't have any major issues and could recover his health in the future, that would be good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked for nothing but his safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she had once complained about his sudden breakup request, it no longer mattered to her now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, his being alive was the most important thing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover...the fact that he was willing to risk his life to save her was enough for her to cherish for the rest of her life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica quietly watched Mason, unaware of when the people in the ward had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't last long, as she had just undergone surgery herself. So, without realizing it, she fell asleep again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The noisy sounds in the ward woke her up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening her eyes, she realized that doctors and nurses were examining Mason's condition at his bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica became nervous and heard the medical staff next to her say, "Miss. Barlow, don't worry, Mason has woken up. Dr. Larson is now examining his basic condition after waking up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica breathed a sigh of relief and looked at the nurse who was guarding her bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse smiled, "I am responsible for taking care of you in the ward. If Miss. Barlow needs anything, just call me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica understood that this was arranged by the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, thank you." Veronica said, "When can I drink water?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of thirst had become even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can drink a small amount of water now." The nurse said, then brought a cup of warm water and a straw for Veronica to drink while lying down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drinking the water, Veronica felt a little better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, it seemed that Mason's examination was also over, and the people around the bed gradually dispersed. Veronica finally saw Mason's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just like what she had seen before. But at this moment, his eyes were open, and he...really woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if feeling her gaze, Mason turned his head slightly and looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Veronica's mind went blank, and it seemed that only his existence was left in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p></div>
