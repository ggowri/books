        <h1>Chapter 3884</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although there was no one else in the private room at the moment, and there were even bodyguards sent by the Reed family outside, Shirley still instinctively lowered her voice when she mentioned the pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, at the moment, people at school only knew that Veronica was going to marry into the Reed family in two months, but the pregnancy was still a secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My health is still good for now. I plan to take a break from school after the wedding, go on a honeymoon, give birth to the baby, and then see how my body is doing before deciding when to return to school," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was also the decision she and Mason had made after discussing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, after the wedding, her belly would become more and more noticeable. It would be more eye-catching to walk around the school with a big belly, so it was better to take a break from school, give birth, and then return to school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm looking forward to your and Mason's baby. I'm sure it will be very cute," Shirley said with anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After the baby is born, how about being the godmother?" Veronica asked. Shirley looked surprised and asked, "Are you serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I'm joking?" Veronica laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But can I really be the godmother of your child?" Shirley asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why not?" Veronica asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're the eldest grandson of the Reed family, and I..." The difference in status is too great.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Mason were just an ordinary person and I were pregnant, would you still have a problem being the godmother?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" Shirley was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica continued, "You're my friend, you've helped me a lot, and you were the first to find out about my pregnancy. If it weren't for you reminding me, I might have taken stomach medicine or other drugs, and this child might not have been born. So it's only right for you to be the godmother of this child, isn't it?" Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shirley smiled awkwardly and said, "Then...I'll be the godmother of this baby for real!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not just this baby, if I have other children in the future, you'll be the godmother too!" Veronica said. "And your child's godmother, I've already decided."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great!" Shirley smiled broadly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Veronica's phone rang, it was a text message about her bank card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when Veronica saw the contents of the message, her expression became blank, as if she couldn't come back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Shirley leaned over and glanced at her friend's phone, and then she too looked stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this...a real message or a prank?" After all, the amount of money transferred in the message was too shocking. At a glance, there were n zeros after the 2, was it 20 million? Or...uh, 200 million?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... will make a phone call to ask," Veronica said, and dialed the bank's customer service number directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The answer she received confirmed that the 20 billion transfer was indeed real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica quickly called Mason to inquire about the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing the news, Mason simply said, "Your parents mentioned that they wanted to give you a sum of money as a dowry, so you can buy whatever you want with it. If it's not enough, just let them know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Veronica suddenly felt speechless. 20 billion, and it still might not be enough?</p></div>
