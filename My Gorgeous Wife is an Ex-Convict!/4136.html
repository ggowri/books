        <h1>Chapter 4134</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unmentionable things... um, Tina's mind recalled the scene of her hugging Kit in the elevator. If Kit's fans were to know about it, it would surely cause an uproar!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Tina silent, Eugenia was shocked, "No way, you didn't really do something to betray Chandler, did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina rolled her eyes, can't Eugenia think of something more meaningful?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Tina could say anything, a voice suddenly sounded behind the two, "What betrayal are you talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina turned around and saw Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eugenia was a bit embarrassed and quickly said, "No, no, Tina would never do something to hurt you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the more she said that, the more it felt like she was trying to cover something up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eugenia seemed to realize that she was making things worse, so she decided to keep her mouth shut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was a brief awkwardness in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How did you come here?" Tina broke the silence and asked Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I just happened to pass by your school and decided to come find you. I was actually about to call you and ask where you were." But before I could make the call, I saw her first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How about we grab a meal together later? It's been a while since we had a meal together," Chandler suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But I promised Eugenia to treat her to a big meal. So maybe..." Tina's words were interrupted by Eugenia, "No need, treat me to a big meal next time. I won't be a third wheel!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Eugenia left cheerfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina was speechless about her friend's "consideration." She turned to Chandler and said, "Let's go then. Is your car parked in the school parking lot?" After all, classes were already over for the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two of them walked towards the parking lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once they got into the car, Tina said to Chandler, "By the way, my parents wanted me to tell you that day at my house, don't take it too personally. And when you meet them, don't feel awkward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler's hand on the steering wheel tensed up as he mumbled, "I understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was difficult for him not to feel awkward after his future in-laws heard him say those things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But if one day, you really cry and cling to my leg, I'll definitely soften up. Whatever you want, I'll promise you," Tina sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler froze again. Why did he sense from her tone that she seemed to really want to cry and cling to his leg!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you have any place in mind for dinner?" he quickly changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If they continued on this topic, it would only get more awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Whatever works," Tina replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, Chandler took Tina to a well-known VIP restaurant in Emerald City. This restaurant was exclusive to members only.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because of its strict membership policy, many wealthy people liked to dine here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as Chandler and Tina passed by a private room, a voice suddenly called out, "Wait!"</p></div>
