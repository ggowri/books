        <h1>Chapter 2264</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the woman had helped Kyla in prison, she was too full of schemes now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such a thing happened to Kyla when she went to the temple with this woman. Was it really just a coincidence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door of the room opened and Jacqueline Bowman walked out with red eyes. After seeing Martin Weiss, Jacqueline Bowman repeatedly said, "Mr. Weiss, it's my fault. It's all my fault. I asked Kyla to wait for me in the car and left to look for my phone. I didn't think Kyla would run into car thieves in broad daylight&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Jacqueline Bowman coldly. His cold gaze made Jacqueline Bowman shudder, and a chill rose up to her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, it's your fault." Martin Weiss's voice rang out coldly. Then, he walked past Jacqueline Bowman and began to talk to the officers handling the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman shuddered, her face turning increasingly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn thought Jacqueline Bowman was remorseful, so she comforted her with red eyes and said, "Don't... mind what Martin said. He's just worried about Kyla. If he must blame someone, he should blame it on me. I shouldn&rsquo;t have asked Kyla to go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman then pretended to comfort Mrs. Corbyn while contemplating how much Kyla would suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had joined forces with Mr. Lambert, who arranged for those two car thieves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and Mr. Lambert instructed the two car thieves to rape Kyla and cause her to miscarry. Then, Mr. Lambert would &lsquo;accidentally find&rsquo; Kyla and bring her to Martin Weiss to claim the credit. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Martin Weiss wanted to cover up this scandal, he would have to give Mr. Lambert some business deals. Then, Mr. Lambert would give her some money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This way, she could vent her anger, get paid, and see Kyla suffer. It would be killing multiple birds with one stone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman felt smugger at the thought of this, but she pretended to look guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she had to do was show she had nothing to do with it. Mr. Lambert would handle the rest...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jacqueline Bowman was slightly dumbfounded an hour later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several groups of people came to the police station. Besides Martin Weiss, Emerald City's famous Young master Reed Jason and his wife, Grace, came as well. The chairman of Stephenson Group, Hadwin Stephenson, and his wife, Lina, were also here. Emerald City's chief of police, deputy chief of police, and various criminal investigators had arrived as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was taken into an interrogation room, but this time, it was with a different policeman than the one who first took her statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two interrogators looked at her like she was a suspect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was terrified. 'What... What's going on here? Isn't this just a regular car theft case? Even if it&rsquo;s a big deal to Martin Weiss, why are Jason and Hadwin Stephenson involved now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it... not because of Martin Weiss that Kyla got to attend the Stephenson family's full moon party and have Mrs. Reed stand up for her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought it was all because of Martin Weiss that the Stephenson and Reed families were polite to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now... It seemed to be because of Kyla!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police looked like they were trying to solve a serious crime!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Can Mr. Lambert still proceed with our plans smoothly? Will we get caught?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman could not imagine what would happen to her... if the truth was exposed.</p></div>
