        <h1>Chapter 2925</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Beep... Beep...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of waiting came from her phone. Every moment of waiting was agonizing for her. Suddenly, the phone was answered, and a familiar voice came from the other end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes... it's me..." Valda Theller sniffled and choked, "Brian Hart, can you help me find Camille? We were together at the bar today, but I went to the restroom... and when I came back, she was gone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke intermittently, and all the worries and fears she had accumulated burst out when she heard his voice. Tears rolled down her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you now?" Brian Hart asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm still at the bar..." she sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the name and location of the bar?" Brian Hart asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Valda Theller reported the address and name of the bar, Brian Hart asked, "Where are you now? Where in the bar are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm at table 29. Camille and I were sitting here before. The last time I saw Camille was also at this table," she said, her voice trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, stay where you are, don't move, I'll be right there!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian Hart, will you help me find Camille?" she asked, her voice choked with tears. He was her last hope. "I'm so afraid that something will happen to Camille, so afraid..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I will help you find Camille Strickland! Don't worry! Wait for me!" he said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call ended, Valda Theller stood nervously in place. Brian Hart said he would come, so he would definitely come! As long as he came, Camille could be found!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, although her heart was still uneasy, she no longer felt as lost as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the manager she had previously spoken to walked up to her, accompanied by a middle-aged man in a suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The middle-aged man respectfully said, "You must be Miss Valda Theller."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I am," Valda Theller replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, I am the manager of the bar. I'm sorry your friend went missing in our bar. We will definitely take responsibility and help you find your friend!" he said, in stark contrast to when Valda Theller had previously spoken to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at him blankly. "Did Brian Hart contact you?" she asked, thinking that was the only possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Mr. Hart and I spoke on the phone. He will be here soon. We are also checking the surveillance footage. Can you tell me the time you and your friend were at table 29, the last time you saw your friend, and the time you discovered she was missing?" the manager asked, starting to ask Valda Theller about the key time points.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a figure rushed over, and it was Brian Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller burst into tears again when she saw Brian Hart. "Okay, don't cry, don't cry!" Brian Hart hugged Valda Theller tightly. "I'm here, nothing will happen, we will find Camille Strickland soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda Theller tried to stop crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The group went to the surveillance room, where they had already found the relevant time points. Sure enough, after Valda Theller left, a woman came to their table and seemed to be talking to Valda Theller. Although the woman's face was blurry in the surveillance footage, Valda Theller could roughly determine that she did not know this woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While the woman was chatting with Camille Strickland, Camille suddenly looked up and looked towards the stage. At this moment, the woman's hand reached for the glass in front of Camille Strickland, as if putting something into the glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Camille Strickland continued to drink, and soon after, she collapsed on the table. The woman then helped Camille Strickland up and walked out of the bar.</p></div>
