        <h1>Chapter 2584</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes were teary. Then, her tears could not help rolling down from her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did this happen... How did this happen..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss asked us not to tell you about the second liver transplant before the operation. We agreed after considering your condition." After all, it was her husband's request, and the hospital could not refuse him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla closed her eyes as she cried harder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Martin Weiss not let the doctor tell me because he was afraid I would be psychologically burdened? Was he afraid that I wouldn't agree to the operation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The man has forgotten his feelings for me. Why did he endanger himself like that? If the operation had failed, he might have died on the operating table!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's more, even though the operation was successful, his health will plummet. His quality of life will never be the same!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why... Why would he do that?' Kyla opened her eyes and looked at Grace beside her with tears on her face. "Grace, why didn't you tell me earlier?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Like what the doctor said, you weren't in good health at that time, and Trista was in the neonatal care unit. If we told you about Martin Weiss then, we were afraid you'd get too emotional and it wouldn&rsquo;t be good for your recovery."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Grace said, "I saw that your body has almost recovered and Trista is like a normal child now, so I wanted to tell you soon. I didn't expect Martin Weiss to get a lawyer to begin the divorce procedures."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla asked with a sob, "Do you know how Martin is doing? Is he... okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the lawyer Martin Weiss had entrusted said Martin Weiss was doing okay, Kyla could not believe the lawyer now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "He&rsquo;s been recuperating in the Weiss family's mansion. He also handles many of the company affairs in the mansion. He rarely goes to the company, but he has professional medical staff taking care of him in the mansion." This was what she found out from Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla trembled slightly. She knew that Martin Weiss had always been eager to outdo others and was dedicated to his career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had to stay in the mansion for more than two months to recuperate. She could imagine the state of his health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla returned somewhat dazed to the store from the hospital while accompanied by Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was shocked to see her daughter's face covered with tears. "What... What's come over you? Why are you crying like that? What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said bitterly, "Mom, I owe Martin Weiss so much. Martin Weiss donated his liver to me twice, but I only found out now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, how ca I pay him back? How?" Kyla held her mother in her arms and wept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn gently patted her daughter on the shoulder, soothing her like when she was a child. No matter how old her daughter was, she was still a child to her.</p></div>
