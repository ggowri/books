        <h1>Chapter 1585</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie instantly shuddered and turned to look at the person who just appeared. 'It's... Jason!' Instantly, all she could think of was that... she was done for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you done with your conversation?" asked Grace as she looked at Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah," he answered and stepped forward. "What's the matter? Is someone bothering you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's nothing much. Miss Menzie probably doesn't know that I'm a lawyer. Since she wants to slander me, I'll take legal action. It&rsquo;s inevitable that I&rsquo;ll sue Miss Menzie," Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyebrows raised slightly. It seemed that his wife was tougher than he expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had previously thought of helping her if anyone dared to give her a hard time at this banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it seemed she would give others a harder time if they dared do so!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie hurriedly explained when she heard this, "Mr. Reed, don't get me wrong. I... I didn't mean to slander Mrs. Reed. I was just... worried that your wife will be misunderstood, so I thought I'd ask her to talk about what she's been doing the past five years after leaving Emerald City."]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Misunderstood?" Jason stared at Simona Menzie coldly. "Who misunderstood? Anyone who misunderstood should step forward now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who dared to step forward?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie was alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Reed... Really... I just said that because many people have misunderstood your wife. I... I meant no harm. Believe me..." Simona Menzie said with a ghastly pale face. No matter how stupid she was, she knew she had now become cannon fodder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What are you? Who are you to ask my wife to tell you her whereabouts in the past five years? Since when does the Menzie family have the right to ask about the Reed family's affairs?" Jason asked without mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie could hardly continue standing when she heard him speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, a man in his 50s quickly walked over. It was Simona Menzie's father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After hearing that his daughter was giving Grace a hard time, Mr. Menzie had come over at once. Then, he happened to hear Jason's previous sentences. His face immediately turned pale like his daughter's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He quickly said to Jason, "Mr. Reed, it's all a misunderstanding. Of course, we dare not ask about your family affairs, Mr. Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie felt a little more confident when she saw that her father was here. "Yeah, it's a misunderstanding. Mr. Reed, I only did it for you. I was just worried that the Reed family will be badly affected if people misunderstand that your wife did something bad. So I asked your wife to tell&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Menzie was instantly dumbfounded when he heard his daughter say this. He was apologizing, but his daughter was adding fuel to the fire. 'Why did I give birth to such an idiotic daughter?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Shut up!" Mr. Menzie slapped his daughter. Simona Menzie stumbled and almost fell to the floor from the slap.</p></div>
