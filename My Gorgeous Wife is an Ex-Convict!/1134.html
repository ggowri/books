        <h1>Chapter 1133</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to say no, but looking at Brian's serious expression, she swallowed the refusal back in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The phone in her hand seemed to have gotten a little heavier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Come on. I'll send you home first. I'll look into what happened today! You won't be set up for nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We've reported it to the police, and they'll look into it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't be rest assured if only the police are looking into this," said Brian. If anyone tried to harm her, then he would take care of the snake in the grass. "I won't spare anyone who harms you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly asked, "What if the person who wants to harm me is Stella? You won't spare her too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stiffened. This possibility was the last thing he wanted to think about. He could punish others severely and make them pay for it a thousand times over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after all... Stella was the one he had longed for more than 20 years and the one who saved his life when he was a child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he could, he wanted to give her a lifetime of wealth and peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Grace laughed to herself. "Forget about it." She walked out of the police station as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked more slowly because of her shoes&mdash;one had a shoelace while the other did not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was walking down the steps outside the police station, she lifted her foot and the shoe with no shoelace flew straight out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Grace gave a low cry. She was about to go down and pick up the shoe when a figure came forward a step faster than her and picked it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took the shoe and walked over to her. He crouched down and placed it carefully on her foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she slipped her foot into the shoe, his hand pressed on it carefully, helping to hold it in place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Thank you." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian got up. "If there&rsquo;s no shoelace on your shoe, you'll easily kick it off your foot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, before Grace could respond, he picked her up and headed to his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. After all, one of his hands was still wrapped in gauze. "Your hand is injured. Put me down!" She panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "I broke my wrist, not my arm. I can still carry you like this." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said hastily, "Even so, what if you hit your wrist? What if you make your wrist injury worse, which will only make it harder to heal? Bone injuries can be serious!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because her broken finger bones did not recover properly back then that she was left with these sequelae, and she suffered terribly because of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her anxiety brought a smile to Brian's lips, which turned the usual indifference on his face into some kind of pure youth-like joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "It's nice that you worry about me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze. "What's nice about that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "This means that you have me in your heart. Even if it&rsquo;s just a very, very small place, it exists!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She had no way to counter what he said because... he was Bryn! The Bryn who had gone through thick and thin with her!</p></div>
