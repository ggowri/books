        <h1>Chapter 3410</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica shuddered and walked up to him, saying, "Let's go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he replied, packing up his backpack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he stood up, he also picked up her backpack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching Mason carry two backpacks, Veronica forgot when he started doing this alone, as if he had been doing it since elementary school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she was older than him, she should have taken care of him more, but somehow she ended up being the one taken care of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them walked to the school gate, where a car was waiting for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Mason currently lived with the Barlow family, the Reed family sent a car to pick them up and drop them off every day, and if the Barlow family needed a car, they could contact the driver directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car arrived at the Barlow family's neighborhood, which is a luxurious community in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow family lives in a 200 square meter house in this neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If converted to market price, it would cost at least 30 million or more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These were undoubtedly given by the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyone who knows the Barlow family says they've had a stroke of luck, as they were fortunate enough to adopt the second son of the Reed family who was wandering outside. Now they can live off this parasite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Parasites... Yes, Veronica sometimes feels that the current lifestyle of the Barlow family is indeed very much like that of parasites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although my father claims to have a job, it's really just a business opportunity that he's able to secure thanks to his relationship with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's not that the father does business, it's just that those people want to please the Reed family through the Barlow family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the stepmother, on the other hand, spends her days extravagantly, dressing up beautifully every day, and indulging in shopping or playing cards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My half-brother, who has the same father but a different mother, is the same age as Mason. However, he is still in junior high school and always likes to buy various branded items. Moreover, she knows that her brother likes to act like a big shot outside and spends money recklessly, often treating classmates to meals and such.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when at home, especially when facing Mason, she would put on a subservient and smiling face. Despite being only 14 years old, she acted this way, sometimes even making Veronica uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? What are you thinking about?" Mason asked as he got off the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much," she said. "Let's go upstairs, I still have homework to do later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pursed his lips and followed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he grew older, he inexplicably became more and more uneasy, feeling as though the distance between him and her was gradually widening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the two returned home, the other family members had not yet arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The hired help brought in by the Barlow family was preparing dinner, so Veronica and Mason went to Veronica's room to do their homework, as they usually did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Veronica was about to take out her homework book from her backpack, her eyebrows furrowed and she let out a small sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the movement involved the shoulder, I suddenly felt pain again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Veronica's unusual behavior was subtle, Mason noticed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with your shoulder?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned, "I don't like it when you always say 'nothing' to me," as if she was shutting him out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I really..."</p></div>
