        <h1>Chapter 3092</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda widened her eyes, feeling his breath all over her face, making her extremely confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, their faces were very close, as if his lips would kiss her in the next moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, you will hold yourself responsible for me, won't you?" He whispered, not only his eyes, but even his voice was unusually seductive, "I know you won't just play with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." She was speechless for a moment, not knowing how to respond to his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Playing around... in the vast Emerald City, who dares to just "play around" with this entertainment industry prince!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, Grace was shocked when she heard the news that Valda had returned to Emerald City. She stared at Jason with disbelief written all over her face and asked, "What did you say? Valda... is back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, they arrived in Emerald City a few days ago, but only met up with Brian the day before yesterday," Jason shared the information he had received.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was puzzled, "Valda...how come you came back to Emerald City but didn't look for Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In theory, it shouldn't be like that. If Valda returns to Emerald City, the first person she should look for is probably Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, she..." Jason's voice paused, and he looked at his wife because he knew that if he said the rest of the sentence, Grace would have a certain reaction. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent for a moment, then nodded and said, "Okay, let her come."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong with her?" Grace asked urgently, feeling a hint of unease rising in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She has a limp in one leg," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With just this sentence, Grace was suddenly shocked and then her eyes turned red and tears welled up and flowed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why...?" Grace choked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was due to delayed treatment. She was hit by water and her leg hit a hard object, causing a fracture. The leg wasn't set properly and the nerve damage wasn't detected and treated in time, so this happened," Jason explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had started investigating related information as soon as he found out that Valda had returned to Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda had previously been taken to the hospital for consultation by Brian, and Jason now had a copy of the consultation data.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can it still be treated?" Grace asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's unlikely," Jason said. "Brian took Valda to see the best orthopedic and neurological experts in tMason Swansonty two days ago, and the conclusion was that the chances of a full recovery are extremely low."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, this leg will be disabled for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Extremely low, but there's still a chance, right?" Hope flickered in Grace's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In medicine, there are no absolutes. Doctors never speak in absolutes. It's just that whether it can really be cured or not, it can only be left to luck in the future," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Grace understood that if Jason said this, it basically meant that it was impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She did it for Jasmine, for Jasmine," Grace cried. "If it wasn't for saving Jasmine, her leg wouldn't be lame. Jason, we owe Valda a leg. Valda... she's not even 30 yet!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know, I will find a way to do everything I can to make it up to her," Jason said, wiping the tears from Grace's face with a tissue. "Grace, please don't cry. Now that Valda is back, I will contact renowned doctors abroad to see if there is still hope for her leg. As for anything else, no matter what troubles Valda may face in the future, I will help her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I want to go see Valda right now," Grace said. It had been a year, and every day she had been thinking about Valda and the debt of gratitude she owed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll take you there," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Immediately, he instructed someone to prepare a vehicle and then verified Valda's current location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace and Valda arrived at Valda's apartment, Valda was momentarily stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Brian had not left the apartment, and the four of them were looking at each other.</p></div>
