        <h1>Chapter 360</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Evelyn stared at the painting in front of her. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before this, when she walked past this atelier and wanted to take a look, she got stopped by Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once more, she could not control her curiosity. She pushed open the door and walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect to see Grace&rsquo;s portrait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not Grace when she was an adult, but rather it was her when she was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a little girl carrying a little boy on her back in the painting. The little girl was Grace when she was young.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The floral dress the little girl was wearing... Evelyn recalled seeing the same dress in Grace&rsquo;s photo album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Why is there a portrait of Grace in Brian&rsquo;s atelier? What&rsquo;s the relationship between Brian and Grace?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Too many questions appeared in Evelyn&rsquo;s brain. Panic rose in her heart. This feeling was even more intense than what she felt just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as Grace was about to snatch away everything she had worked so hard to obtain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No! No way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not let this happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter what relationship Grace had with Brian, she was still Brian&rsquo;s girlfriend! She would be married into the Hart family in the future. She was the one who was going to be the matriarch of a rich family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went back to Reed Residence and walked to Jason&rsquo;s bedroom. After hesitating for a few seconds, she knocked on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the door was opened. Jason was wearing a bathrobe, and his hair was still wet. It was obvious that he had just taken a shower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Um&hellip; Goodnight,&rdquo; she said before turning around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the one who requested she does this every night after she came back. He wanted her to come and say goodnight to him if he was at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the next second, he grabbed her arm and pulled her into the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Do you only plan to say goodnight to me, Sis?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips together. Her almond-shaped eyes looked at him innocently. Her expression was evidence that she only came here to say goodnight to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sighed and bent down. He wrapped Grace into his arms and buried his face between her neck and shoulder. He took in the sweet scent that was coming from her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if her smell could baffle all of his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I miss you so much, Sis. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you the entire day,&rdquo; he muttered. His deep voice sounded like he was chanting something beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as if her heart was getting struck by something. It felt numb and fuzzy. Feelings were coursing through her entire body through her bloodstream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Sis, do you miss me?&rdquo; His breath hit the skin of her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip and did not know how to answer him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In an instant, the room fell silent.</p></div>
