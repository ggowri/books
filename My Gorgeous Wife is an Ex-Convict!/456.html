        <h1>Chapter 455</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, let's eat," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The four of them started eating their lunch. Jason offered to help Grace peel the prawns when they were eating this particular dish. Grace was a little embarrassed. After all, they were now in front of her best friend and Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina, in particular, even winked at her, making Grace a little speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked so graceful while peeling the prawns for her that he did not seem to care about other people's opinions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the meal was over, Jason reminded Grace, "Don't forget to take your medicine 20 minutes after lunch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sick?" Lina was shocked and asked with immediate concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's just some health-restoring pills. It&rsquo;s medicine for the pain in my joints," answered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. She knew about her best friend's imprisonment for three years. After she was released from prison, she suffered from rheumatism. Her joints would hurt when the weather was cold and gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had advised Grace to go to the hospital to check it out and treat it, but Grace always gave a lot of excuses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew Grace thought it was too expensive to treat it and that it would be over soon if she just hung in there. She tried to pay for the medical expenses once but was refused by Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that Grace was starting to take care of her body and health, it must be Jason's doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's fondness for Jason increased suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace's ordeal in prison was somewhat related to Jason, he did not know Grace back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could see that Jason was really nice to her best friend. It would not be the worst outcome if Jason could be her best friend's happy ending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, Grace could finally enjoy life after all her sufferings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was time to take the medicine, Jason gave Grace a cup of warm water. Then, he took out the medicine, placed it on her palm, and made her take it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at his delicate and gentle movements. She could feel how Jason doted on her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How much a man doted on a woman was not judged from how much money he gave her or how well he could talk, but how much he would do for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace finished taking her medicine, Lina dragged Grace to the washroom and curiously asked, "Are you and Jason really together now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace nodded unabashedly, confessing her feelings in front of her best friend. "Lina, I thought I'd never fall in love with anyone anymore, but now I want to try to date him and see... if we can make it to the end?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her feelings were careful. She took every step with more caution because she had once been hurt in a relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why wouldn't you?" Lina patted Grace on the shoulder and said, "Before this, I would have thought it was impossible between you and Jason, but today, I can see that he's serious about you. I mean, people say all kinds of things about Jason, but when it comes to women, he has kept his hands to himself. It seems that he only had one fianc&eacute;e, Jennifer Atkinson..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina stopped short and glanced awkwardly at Grace. After all, Jennifer Atkinson was not only Jason's former fianc&eacute;e but also the victim of the car accident.</p></div>
