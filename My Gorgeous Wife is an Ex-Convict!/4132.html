        <h1>Chapter 4130</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Kit, can you still hear my voice? Adjust your breathing, take deep breaths, inhale...exhale...inhale again, exhale..." She repeated tirelessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She kept talking until her mouth felt dry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't know how long had passed, but his breathing finally started to calm down, no longer so rapid, and the trembling of his body gradually ceased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina finally breathed a sigh of relief, at least this comforting seemed to have some effect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, all they could do was wait for rescue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit felt like he was trapped in an endless darkness, where there was nothing but him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And he, doesn't know when this darkness will dissipate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why is it him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why does he have to go through all this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why does he have to endure this kind of pain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So many whys, but only one answer - this world is inherently unfair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he just holds on a little longer... just a little longer...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just like he used to endure, if he endures, everything will be okay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He waits for that familiar deepening sense of unbearable pain, but this time, something feels different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Inhale... exhale... inhale again... exhale again..." A gentle voice, through layers of darkness, echoes in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That is... Tina's voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her voice keeps pouring into his ears, making the darkness seem less terrifying!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That lonely and fearful terror slowly dissipates because of her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He slowly opens his eyes, and through the faint yellow light of the phone flashlight, her face appears before his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It's really her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he was scared and helpless, she accompanied him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How are you? Feeling better?" Tina asks with a worried expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyelashes tremble slightly, "Much better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's good." Tina takes a breath, "You have no idea how scary you looked just now, but now you're okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looks at the hands wrapped around him, "You... have been holding me all this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah, I thought maybe it would make you feel like you're not alone, I'm here with you!" Tina says, then she seems to think of something and quickly adds, "I'm not trying to take advantage of you, really, I'm just doing this because you said you have claustrophobia..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I know," he says.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But have you sought treatment for this condition at a hospital?" she asks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He purses his lips and doesn't answer immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm not trying to pry into your privacy or anything, I just want you to be well," Tina reiterates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His gaze falls on her, "I know you mean well, I have sought treatment at a hospital, but it hasn't improved much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina also knows that this kind of claustrophobia is mostly caused by some unpleasant experiences in the past, which leads to the development of this illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This kind of psychological illness is not something that can be cured just by saying it's cured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Since you're fine now, then..." she said, releasing her hands that were holding him. But just as she was about to retract her hand, he suddenly reached out and grabbed her right hand.</p></div>
