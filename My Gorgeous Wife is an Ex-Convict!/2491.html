        <h1>Chapter 2489</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Not really. Someone left a file at my hotel room door and rang my doorbell. I opened the door and saw the file. There was a detailed description of how you lost your finger and a list of people who were there at the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was shocked. "Who left the file?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I'm not sure. That person wore a cap and a thick coat. They left after making sure I had seen the information. They took a taxi outside the hotel and deliberately avoided the surveillance cameras on the road. The car had a fake number plate, so we couldn't find it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said. All this was seen on the surveillance footage afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who is it?" Amber Mitchell was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whoever it is, they probably gave it to me to help you or because they have a grudge against Louise Mitchell." Grace surmised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Help me? Who else would help me but Grace and Kyla?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'the Moss family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But the Moss family probably won't do such a thing. Even though Herman's car accident wasn&rsquo;t an accident, the Moss family will only focus on finding the real culprits rather than trying to prove that Louise Mitchell did cut off my finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Then... who else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who did that for me now that I have nothing?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, when are you leaving?" Amber Mitchell stopped thinking about who helped her and asked Grace about her plans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "The day after tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll arrange for my lawyer friends in Deer City to contact you. You can consult them about any legal matters."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," Amber Mitchell said gratefully. She had said thank you many times these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank me? You can come to us anytime if you're willing to come to Emerald City later," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll think about it," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace left Amber Mitchell's apartment and was about to get into her car when a car suddenly pulled up and stopped in front of her. A woman got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace saw her face, there was a flash of surprise in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman looked 70% like her. The way she dressed was also similar to hers, and that added a little more similarity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must be Grace." She smiled at Grace and said, "Hello, I'm Whitney Cooper, Brian's private secretary. I've been looking forward to meeting you. I knew you were in Deer City, but I didn't know where you were staying. I only found out where Amber Mitchell lived, so I came here to try my luck. I didn't expect to really see you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, she had intentionally come to look for her! Grace could not help pressing her lips together as she looked at the face similar to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian's private secretary... Is Brian looking for substitutes again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is the woman in front of me my substitute?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she knew Brian had kept one substitute after another by his side during their years apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You wanted to see me?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I would like to talk to you, Mrs. Reed. I wonder if you'll allow me to have the chance?&rdquo; she said politely. However, Grace was disgusted by the person in front of her.</p></div>
