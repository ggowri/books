        <h1>Chapter 1081</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason reached out and picked up the ancient sword.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was immediately taken aback. The sword&hellip; was giving her a sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Remember when I told you that someone from the Reed family used to keep a woman here? That woman fell in love with him, but she still killed that man with this sword,&rdquo; Jason said lightly as if it was just a story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... This actually happened!' Grace was shocked. What he was saying now was a plot twist from what he said last time. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought the woman left with the man from the Reed family after falling in love with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It never occurred to her that the woman... would use this sword to kill the man she fell in love with!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why? Shame? Remorse? Regret?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Because she fell in love with another man when she had someone else she loved deeply?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was that why she made this choice?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are the mottled marks on the sword... blood? Is the blood from back then still on the sword?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it called&hellip; Splashes of Blood because blood is spattered on the sword?" she asked incoherently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's not all," he said and walked to the wall lined with heavy curtains, giving them a jerk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The wall behind the curtains immediately caught Grace's eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This wall was different from the other several walls. It was not renovated and looked just like what it looked like back then. The splashes of discolored blood on the wall were so obvious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt an urge to throw up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The many bloodstains on the wall were preservation of incriminating evidence! 'Is it called Splashes of Blood because of the wall?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to leave, you can kill me just as the woman did and then you may leave," he said as he came up to her and held out the sword in his hand with its hilt toward her. "Do you want to kill me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a touch of madness in those bright black eyes. He was like a gambler who was gambling what place he occupied in her heart, and the wager was his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the man in front of her. 'Kill him? I&rsquo;ve never thought of it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even... Even if she had thought he was going to lock her up for life, she never thought of killing him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her shocked eyes with a stunning, relieved smile on his lips. "You can't bear to do so, can you? You don't want me to die, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her throat was dry. She wanted to refute him, but even spitting out a word seemed so difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You still have me in your heart, so one day, you'll fall in love with me again. Grace, let's make a bet whether you'll fall in love with me again. I'll bet you the rest of my life," he said firmly.</p></div>
