        <h1>Chapter 624</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on here?' What the childish voice said in her dream just now was so similar to what Brian said to her in the small restaurant this evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because I heard those words that I&rsquo;m having such a dream now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but frown at the thought of this and felt her head hurt again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? Are you not feeling well?" Jason's voice rang in Grace's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, just a small headache," she answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand. The tips of his warm fingers gently pressed against her forehead and temples, massaging her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The strength of his fingers was just right and the rubbing made her feel better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Feel better?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, better," she answered as she nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I take you to the hospital tomorrow to have a check-up and see what's causing the headache?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. My headache is probably due to the dream I had. I think it&rsquo;s because of what Brian said," answered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's hands immediately stopped what they were doing. "What did you just say? What Brian said?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He came to the restaurant today. He probably still thinks of me as the person he has been looking for and said some strange things. Then... I had a dream just now. I dreamt of two children and they seemed to be saying the same thing Brian said to me today." Grace explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's expression sank. "What exactly was your dream about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then told him about the scene she saw in her dream. "It's probably influenced by what Brian said. That's why I had this dream. Brian told me I said that to him, but I have no memory of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's because... She forgot!' Jason said to himself. It was because she had a high fever and forgot all about the day she disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reason why he knew this was he had sent someone to investigate this matter when he came to the realization that she might be the person Brian was looking for. After a long search, he found out from the hospital records that she was hospitalized back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hospital records, he learned that she had lost her memories of that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A day's worth of memories was nothing to others. It was just that she could not explain why she had disappeared that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was all right, so the adults did not pursue it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some people, they only lost a day's worth of memories. For others, it was 20 years of searching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had not lost her memories from that day, she would have remembered Brian. Maybe... Brian would have already found her and they might even be together now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As such, he was thankful that she had forgotten about that day. Her medical records and her hospital records had all been tampered with already.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Brian looked into it, what he would find was only what he would like to show him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In that case, you must stop thinking about him. Let me rub your head a little more," Jason spoke in a soft voice.</p></div>
