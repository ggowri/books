        <h1>Chapter 2462</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guards&rsquo; expressions changed slightly at this. Finally, one of them reluctantly made an internal call. "There are two people who claim to know Mr. Moss and want to enter..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before the security guard finished speaking, Jason took the phone and said to the other end of the line, "I'm Jason. My wife Grace and I would like to see Mr. Moss now. Would you please put Mr. Moss on the phone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was silence on the other end of the line. Moments later, Daley Moss's voice came. "Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's me. I'm sorry to bother you so late at night, but I happened to learn that you're in the cemetery. My wife and I are just outside the cemetery. We&rsquo;re here to take Amber Mitchell back to the hospital," Jason said calmly as if they were having an ordinary conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take her back?" Daley Moss's voice sounded vaguely displeased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else could it be? If something happens to her in your family's cemetery, you probably won't be able to explain yourself. After all, her issue is such a big deal right now. Who knows how the media will write about her and your brother's history if something happens to her in the cemetery?" Jason said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss seemed to speak through clenched teeth, "Jason, are you threatening me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'm just talking about a possibility," Jason said gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Daley Moss said, "Okay, give the phone to the security guard. I'll ask them to let you in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled and handed the phone to the security guard. After listening for a moment, the security guard ended the call and respectfully let them into the cemetery with another guard leading the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace saw Amber Mitchell, she was kneeling in front of Herman Moss's grave while surrounded by scattered incense sticks and lit candles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss, his wife, and the cemetery's security guards were standing nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss looked at Amber Mitchell coldly and said sharply, "So what if you came to pay your respects? Is my brother going to come back to life if you get on your knees? He won't come back to life. He never will. He shouldn&rsquo;t have died to protect a woman who didn&rsquo;t love him at all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell knelt motionlessly as if she were a sinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked up to Amber Mitchell. "Come on. Let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell slowly looked up, her lips quivering as she said, "I... I want to finish burning the incense for Herman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glanced at the half-burned incense scattered on the ground and sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's voice rang out again. "Amber Mitchell, who are you to offer incense to my brother? If you hadn't told him that you didn't love him, how could he have been so desperate that he gave up his life in such a way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The words stung Amber Mitchell like the most piercing ice pick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell shuddered as she looked imploringly at Daley Moss. "Let me... finish burning the incense. I know I did him wrong. I did him wrong!" If she could, she would give her life for Herman to come back alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out the cruelest thing God could do was to make one realize who one should cherish the most only after they were gone! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not take it anymore, so she said, "Mr. Moss, if your eldest brother did love Amber Mitchell, I think he decided to give his life to protect her not out of desperation but... wanting his loved one to live a good life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's face was icy.</p></div>
