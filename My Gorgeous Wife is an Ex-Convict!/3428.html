        <h1>Chapter 3426</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a voice sounded, "You've been waiting for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica snapped out of it and only saw Daniel walking over with a tray in his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, I didn't wait very long," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here you go, this is the B combo you wanted," said Daniel as he placed a B combo in front of Veronica and sat down. "What were you thinking just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much, just thinking if this counts as a date..." Veronica blurted out, but as soon as the words left her mouth, she realized something was off. Her face turned bright red. "I...I didn't mean it like that, I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's face also turned red, but he confidently said, "It's a date!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was surprised and looked at Daniel in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel scratched his head awkwardly, "Of course, it's just for me. You agreed to come out with me today, and I'm happy. I hope today can be considered a date."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica blushed and lowered her head, burying herself in her lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel smiled and ate lunch with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing their meal, Daniel checked the time and said, "Shall we go to the square later? There are usually street performances on weekends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Veronica replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them left the mall and headed towards the nearby square.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, an electric scooter swerved to avoid a pedestrian and headed towards Daniel and Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica instinctively tried to dodge, but the scooter was moving too fast. She closed her eyes, thinking it was going to hit her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a force suddenly grabbed her arm and pulled her to the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she ran into a wide embrace, while the electric bike crashed into the green area behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was breathing heavily, still in shock. She heard Daniel's concerned voice in her ear, "Are you okay? Did the car hit you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica realized that it was Daniel who had saved her earlier by holding onto her, allowing her to escape danger. Now, she found herself completely enveloped in Daniel's embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank...thank you, I'm fine. The car didn't hit me," she said, her face slightly blushing as she tried to pull away from his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great, I'm so glad you're okay!" exclaimed Daniel as he hugged Veronica tightly with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her body stiffened, and her hands were placed between her and his chest. At this moment, she could have pushed him away, but she didn't.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I can't express my feelings at this moment, but... she knows that she doesn't really want to push him away, to push away this big guy with a bright smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica and Daniel, at this moment, did not notice that a car was parked nearby. Inside the car, Mason was sitting in the back seat, watching the scene through the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This scene made him feel extremely uncomfortable, and once again he heard Jasper's words in his ear, "If a girl is willing to risk getting hurt or even hit in order to protect another guy, it means she likes him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So... does Sister really like Daniel?</p></div>
