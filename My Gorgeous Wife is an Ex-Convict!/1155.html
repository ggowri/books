        <h1>Chapter 1154</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on, I'll send you home." Brian took Grace by the hand and led her out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Out of the corner of his eyes, Jason glanced at Brian and Grace's figures as they left. Then, he lightly ordered Patrick, "Ask all your staff to leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? They..." Patrick pointed to the waitress with the injured finger and Mr. Lee, who was still on his knees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let them stay," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Patrick asked the staff inside and outside the private room to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the only people left in the private room were Jason, Patrick, the waitress, Mr. Lee, Terrence, and several of Jason's bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took the waitress' hand and gently caressed her index finger that was wrapped in gauze. His lowered eyes seemed to be thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's face appeared bashful, and a hint of surprise flashed through Patrick's eyes. 'Is it true that Jason is interested in this woman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, what Jason said surprised Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want your nails pulled out so badly, then go ahead and pull them out. You&rsquo;ll get to fulfill your wish too," Jason said lightly as he loosened his hold on the woman's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman instantly turned pale, and her body trembled a little. "Master Reed... I... I don't get what you mean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't get it?" Jason ordered Terrence who was nearby, "Let her understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence stepped forward and said to the waitress, "You and Mr. Lee are old friends. One of your relatives went to prison and was in the same cell as Grace. I think you learned about Miss Cummins having her fingernails pulled out from your relative and asked Mr. Lee to help you put on such a show."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Jason's former relationship with Grace was no secret in high society, and those who were keen could naturally find out about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Terrence said this, both the woman and Mr. Lee, who was kneeling on the ground, suddenly trembled like shaking sieves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No, Master Reed... I... I really..." The woman wanted to say something, but Jason did not even bother to listen. He just turned to Patrick and said, "I gotta go. You know me, I'll have people pay back double of what they did to me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick and Jason had known each other for so many years. How could he not know his temper? Looking at the woman with a frightened face and trembling body, as well as the man who was kneeling on the ground in a daze, Patrick shrugged. He did not have much sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, many women wanted to snag Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this woman should never have tried to use Grace to get to the top.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was naive to think that pretending to have her fingernails pulled out would arouse Jason's interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was the one most meticulous among them. Who in Emerald City could set Jason up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Ye! Help me!" The woman suddenly rushed toward Patrick and grabbed his arm. With a flustered face, she cried desperately for help, "I... I'll do anything as long as you'll save me, Young Master Ye!"</p></div>
