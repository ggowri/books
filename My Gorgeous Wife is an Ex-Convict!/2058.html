        <h1>Chapter 2056</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I got it!" the lawyer replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Kyla hurried over to the police station. As soon as she saw her son, she rushed forward and examined him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although her mother had said that Nelson only suffered skin injuries and was alright, Kyla teared up at the sight of her son's bruised face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Does it hurt?" she asked with a sore nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn shook his head. "No." However, his face scrunched up when he spoke as the movement tugged at the swollen parts of his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's heart broke again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn blamed herself as she said, "It's all my fault. If I had realized he was in there for too long and got someone to go in sooner, Nelson wouldn't have gotten beaten up like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's not Grandma's fault. I'm... not strong enough," said Nelson Corbyn. He was not strong enough to fight those people. If he were stronger, he would not have gotten hurt and upset his grandma and mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla stroked her son's little head as she said to Mrs. Corbyn, "Alright, I'll take care of this, Mom." With that said, she walked up to the police officer handling the matter. "Hello, I'm Nelson Corbyn's mother. May I leave with the child now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We're done with taking the statements. This lawyer said he&rsquo;s Nelson Corbyn's attorney and will handle the matter. Are you going to handle this privately or file a lawsuit?" the police officer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at the statement before looking at Roy Soto, who took the lead in bullying Nelson. She had already settled the matter behind closed doors with them, but it unexpectedly happened again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss deliberately found a lawyer, and she knew what he was up to. She did not want to get too involved with Martin Weiss, but for the sake of her child...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sue them," said Kyla as she wrote down her refusal. She signed her name and wrote her contact information on the statement record.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When those parents saw that Kyla refused to settle it privately, they immediately looked gloomy. However, they dared not say anything due to Martin Weiss's presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla left the police station with her son and mother without glancing at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they were outside the police station, Kyla was about to lift her hand to hail a taxi when someone suddenly grabbed her arm. "Are you going to leave without even saying hello to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla turned to look at Martin Weiss, who was grabbing her. "Mr. Weiss, I'm going home. Please let go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss stared at Kyla but did not loosen his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There seemed to be an air of depression in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn stepped forward. His little hands tried to pull Martin Weiss away. "Let go of Mommy! Don't grab her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss glanced at his son and said to the subordinate following him, "Take Aunt and Nelson away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," the subordinate replied and said to Nelson Corbyn as he grabbed him, &ldquo;I'll take you two home first, Little Young Master."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn resisted, while Mrs. Corbyn looked anxious, not knowing what to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla clenched her teeth as she said, "Mom, take Nelson home first. I'll go home after talking things through with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm not leaving. I want to go home with you," said Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Be good. I still have some things to take care of. Go home with Grandma first. You haven't finished your homework today. I'll be home soon. Don't worry, I&rsquo;ll be fine," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Nelson was still visibly worried.</p></div>
