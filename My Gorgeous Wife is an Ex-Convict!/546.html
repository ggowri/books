        <h1>Chapter 545</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels smiled and said, "Hello, I'm Paisley Daniels, Wenming's fianc&eacute;e."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, Mr. Reed. I&rsquo;ve something to do, so I&rsquo;ve got to go. See you next time," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Jason answered with a half-smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss and his partner left, Jason turned to Grace and said, "All right, we've found Nelson. Why do you still look worried?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That man&rsquo;s Martin Weiss," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what?" Jason asked lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson is his child, but he has no idea that the child standing in front of him is his flesh and blood," said Grace with an indescribable sadness in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had carefully compared Nelson and Martin Weiss's looks just now. Nelson and Martin Weiss were somewhat similar in appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, don't get emotional about other people's business. This is between Martin Weiss and Kyla. There's no need for us to meddle in it," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and looked down at Nelson. Nelson's cochlear implant had fallen out and he could not hear, so she did not have to worry about Nelson overhearing what they were talking about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three of them went back to the lounge, and after Grace said goodbye to Howell Webb, she followed Jason out the side door again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the cochlear implant had fallen out and Grace did not know how to put it back on for Nelson, she put it away first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want something to eat?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found out it was late, so it was no wonder she was hungry. Nelson was probably hungrier than her, but the little one did not complain at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, are you hungry? How about I take you to dinner now?" "Grace asked Nelson in sign language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one immediately gave a heavy nod.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace remembered that there was an internet-famous family restaurant nearby, which was popular among mothers. She said to Jason, "Why don't we go to the family restaurant nearby? I've seen some pretty good reviews about it online."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." Jason agreed immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pulled out her phone and searched for the address of the family restaurant. It was indeed quite close, only a few hundred meters from where they were now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, the three walked to the family restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The furnishing and decoration of the restaurant were indeed as expected. It felt very &lsquo;childish&rsquo; as if they were at a small playground instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The entire restaurant was divided into the eating area and the play area. There were a lot of toys at the play area as well as slides, an ocean ball pool, a sand area, a trampoline, and so on. Besides that, there were also a variety of building blocks, rocking horses, and other small toys. Anyway, there was a mix of food and fun for the kids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over at the dining area, the paintings on the wall, tableware, and some display cabinets were also child-friendly. The paintings on the wall were of all kinds of fairy tales and fables. You could also tell stories to the children while you were eating.</p></div>
