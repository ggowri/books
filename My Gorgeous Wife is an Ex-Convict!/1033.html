        <h1>Chapter 1032</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She continued saying, "If&hellip; If I really get pregnant someday and the Stephenson family isn't stable yet, we don't have to get married. You don't have to marry me with some grand gesture. I can give birth myself and protect the baby. Just let me have my day once you find it safe!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was stunned. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not afraid of rumors. They can't hurt me at all! I want you forever. For better or worse, I want it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice was so crisp, and the look in her eyes was so determined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson immediately held Lina into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His Lina was stronger and braver than he had imagined. He had belittled her, thinking she needed his protection. It never occurred to him that she could be independent!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just realized the woman I fell in love with is so great!" Hadwin Stephenson chuckled and said, "It's great to have fallen in love with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only wanted to open up a world of possibilities for her so that she could always be happy and carefree!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not expect Jason to bring her to the mourning hall in Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a mourning hall for Jason's father where his memorial tablet was. Grace had only come here twice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Jason brought her over without saying anything. He just stared at the tablet with his eyes lowered. He was holding her hand so tightly that she could not even leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What on earth did you bring me here for?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you remember what you said to me here?" he asked slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned as memories of the past recurred to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's been a long time. I don't remember anymore," she said. Even though this was only a lie, she would eventually forget it someday!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would forget everything about him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don&rsquo;t remember?" He chuckled suddenly. It sounded a little harsh in the mourning hall. "But I remember it very well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said while slowly turning around. His eyes were as dark as the deep night as he stared at her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he stared at her made her a little uncomfortable, so she turned away and said, "Thank you for the two bodyguards' help, but it's late now and I need to go home! If you want to discuss the past with me, you needn't. I think I made that very clear last time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he merely took her hands in his and pressed them against his cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stiffened slightly. Her hands were full of the warmth from his face. His hands were pressing the back of her hand so that she could not move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was forcing her hands, pressing them against his face. If one ignored his hands, it looked like she was holding his face out of her own will.</p></div>
