        <h1>Chapter 2325</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly. "Thank you, but you can't help me with this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper scratched his head. "Take good care of yourself, then. No matter what kind of difficulties you encounter, life will always go on. Maybe in a few years, you'll look back and realize that today's difficulties aren&rsquo;t a big deal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they approached the hotel, Chase Harper looked at the towering hotel with surprise on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a fancy hotel. He thought Kyla was staying in a regular hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you&hellip; staying here?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My friend arranged it," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Chase Harper's stomach made a rumbling sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper smiled in embarrassment as he said to Kyla, "Well... Uh, my belly is already growling. I haven&rsquo;t had dinner yet. Since you&rsquo;ve arrived at your hotel, I'd better go get something to eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't we eat together? I happen to be a little hungry too," said Kyla. There was a small noodle restaurant right in front of them. They entered the restaurant and ordered two bowls of noodles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Chase Harper ate the noodles, Kyla asked, "You came to L City this time. What about Juliet? Who's looking after her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There&rsquo;s a woman living next door who&rsquo;ll help me look after Juliet when I'm busy with work. She accepted 2,000 dollars as a one-time payment," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren&rsquo;t you going to remarry Juliet's mother?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper said, "We only divorced because we couldn't take it anymore, so why would we remarry? I can raise Juliet by myself anyway, but it's a pity that Juliet has to suffer because I can't give her a complete family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A complete family?' Kyla bit her lip. She could not give her children a complete family too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I'll be staying in L City for a few more days. What about you? When are you returning to Emerald City?" asked Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know yet. I guess it depends on when I'm done with my business," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While they were chatting, Chase Harper received a message on his phone. He tapped on the message. It was a voice message from his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Dad, I miss you so much. When will you be back? Also, don't forget to buy me a present!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The childlike voice was so adorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper said to Kyla after he replied to his daughter&rsquo;s voice message, "I told her I would buy her something that would make her happy when I came over, but I don&rsquo;t know what to buy. What can make a child this age happy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper started worrying again at the thought of the gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I accompany you to choose a gift for Juliet when you're free? I want to give her a present too," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... it would be great if you can accompany me to choose a gift. How can I let you spend so much money, though?" said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like Juliet very much, so it's nothing. Besides, you&rsquo;ve helped me a lot too. Alright, that's settled, then. Let me know when you're free," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they finished their noodles, Chase Harper sent Kyla to the hotel&rsquo;s entrance. "I'll... contact you, and we can pick out gifts for Juliet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." Kyla smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two people at the hotel&rsquo;s entrance did not notice a pair of eyes watching them in a car parked in the corner not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly found it ridiculous.</p></div>
