        <h1>Chapter 2593</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom entered the mansion and met Martin Weiss, who was sitting on the couch going through the company's documents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chairman Weiss, I just met your wife outside the mansion. Mrs. Weiss would like to meet you," said Mallory Malcom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's hand holding the pen paused instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She still came!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She came even though he had made it clear on the phone with the lawyer that he was not going to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had deliberately stopped himself from thinking about her and removed her from his mind. However, her voice and face kept recurring to him whenever he calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything that ever happened in the past flashed past his mind one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I was hypnotized! I've forgotten this relationship. Why does this woman still dominate my mind?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chairman Weiss?" Mallory Malcom could not help asking after Martin Weiss's long silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since she wants to see me, I'll see her. Take her to the living room. I'll go downstairs to see her," said Martin Weiss,</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'll bring Mrs. Weiss in," Mallory Malcom said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although others did not know what Chairman Weiss's attitude was toward Mrs. Weiss, he knew that Chairman Weiss cared about Mrs. Weiss even though he seemed indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, why would he instruct him to help make arrangements for Mrs. Weiss when she came to L City back then? He even went to the hotel often to see Mrs. Weiss and spent some time with Mrs. Weiss in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As far as he knew, Chairman Weiss had donated his liver to Mrs. Weiss in Emerald City! As a result, he was now in poor health and had to recuperate in the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not many men would sacrifice their health for a woman. Even old married couples might not be able to do that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom arrived at the entrance and took Kyla inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they reached the living room, Mallory Malcom said to Kyla, "Mrs. Weiss, wait here for a moment. Chairman Weiss will be downstairs soon." With that said, he dismissed the servants and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was suddenly empty, and Kyla became nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not nervous on the way in or when security stopped her at the mansion&rsquo;s entrance. Earlier, all she could think about was seeing him. She wanted to see how he was doing. She had so much to say to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she suddenly became nervous as she did not expect to see him soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Footsteps suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened instantly as she looked toward the stairs, where a slender figure descended the stairs step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked blankly at the man who stepped down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was dressed in a suit and tie with his black hair combed neatly. His graceful step was not as slow as she imagined. He seemed to look the same as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he came down the stairs and walked slowly toward her, she noticed that he had lost weight and his face was a little pale. Even the suit seemed baggy on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Kyla only stared at Martin Weiss until his voice sounded. "Did you come from Emerald City to find me just to stare at me like this?"</p></div>
