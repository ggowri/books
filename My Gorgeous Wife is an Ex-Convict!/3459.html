        <h1>Chapter 3457</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with Veronica, is she uncomfortable?" Mason walked up to Veronica and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...I feel like there are a lot of people here," Veronica awkwardly chuckled. But what really made her uncomfortable were the looks she was getting from the Reed family's relatives in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sympathy, pity, mockery... It's like watching a clown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll accompany Veronica for a walk outside," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it is said to be outside, it is still within the boundaries of the Reed House. After all, the Reed House is quite large, with pavilions, towers, corridors, and waterside pavilions, covering a wide area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's been a while since I've seen Veronica. Veronica, have you missed me?" Mason suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course I have," replied Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you thought of me, yet you didn't come to find me at the Reed family," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned, his words hit her face like a piston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the two of them passed by the ancestral hall, Mason suddenly stopped in his tracks and turned towards the hall. "Veronica, do you know what? Many people say that I look more like my grandfather. The older I get, the more I resemble him. Even my father sometimes stares at me in amazement."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" said Veronica. She wasn't a member of the Reed family, so she had never been inside their ancestral hall or seen a photo of their grandfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, if Mason is really like his grandfather, then his grandfather must have been a very handsome man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, my grandfather didn't have a good ending," Mason's voice continued, "He died because my grandmother left him, and he couldn't survive. He froze to death in the icy and snowy wilderness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was startled, and her heart suddenly contracted strongly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the first time he has heard from his own mouth about the reason for his grandfather's passing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I never imagined that it would end up like this, with such a tragic death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, I wonder if I'll also have an unfortunate ending in the future," Mason said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't believe that!" Veronica quickly denied, "You will definitely have a good outcome in the future, there won't be anything bad happening to you, it will be a very good outcome!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she pulled him aside and said, "Quickly 'spit, spit, spit' and pretend you never said that." After all, it's not auspicious to say such things during the New Year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her anxious appearance seemed to amuse him a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he spat out a "pui pui pui" as she instructed, he gazed at her steadily and asked, "So, Veronica also believes that my future will be good, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His beautiful eyes, with a burning intensity, suddenly made her heart beat faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes...yes," she said, then changed the subject and said, "Let's continue walking around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they walked towards the back garden, they happened to see the Barlow couple and the Reed family's relatives having an argument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What...what did you say?" Archer's face turned red and he pointed at the other person with one hand, clearly furious.</p></div>
