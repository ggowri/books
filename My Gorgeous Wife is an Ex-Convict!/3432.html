        <h1>Chapter 3430</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" She was taken aback, and then suddenly remembered that he had previously thrown the ointment Daniel gave her, which was the same as this ointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her expression let him know that he had guessed correctly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems that you prefer to use the ointment given by Daniel. Do you like Daniel that much?" He approached her again and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I-" Even if she really likes Daniel, it may only be 3 points, but now in his mouth, it seems like it's worth 10 points.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hand took the ointment directly from her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, what are you doing?" She urgently wanted to take back the ointment, but now he was half a head taller than her, and his agility was much more flexible than hers. She couldn't get the ointment back at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want you to use his ointment," said Mason, as he held the ointment in his hand and suddenly closed his hand, squeezing the ointment in his palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just a moment, the ointment from the tube flowed out of his fingers, indicating that he had accidentally squeezed the tube and caused it to burst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... How could you do this!" she glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why can't I do this?" he asked back with a cold tone. "If I do this, Veronica won't be able to use this ointment anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, she felt a chilling sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like... once something doesn't meet his expectations, he chooses to destroy it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He made her suddenly feel a sense of unfamiliarity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though they used to have some disagreements, she never felt this sense of unfamiliarity before. And now, she doesn't know what to say to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this unfamiliar feeling because he has grown up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is no longer the little brother who always followed her and listened to her, but the second son of the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica and Mason are in a cold war. Since Mason destroyed that ointment, Veronica hasn't spoken to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Mason, unusually, hasn't actively sought reconciliation. The two of them are just cold to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the Barlow family members have keenly sensed this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Archer had a chance, he said to Veronica, "What's going on between you and Mason? I warn you, if you make Mason angry and leave the Barlow family, I won't spare you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And then? Are you going to slap me like last time?" Veronica retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer paused for a moment and then said, "Anyway, you need to quickly appease Mason for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica heard the word "interfere", she felt a bitter taste in her mouth. "Mason is my brother, and I will handle things between us on my own. I don't need you to 'guide' me, Dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... Have your wings grown stronger? Do you think that leaving the Reed family makes you something special? Have you ever thought about why you can live in such a house, have luxury cars to pick you up, teachers who treat you well at school, and people calling you Miss He with respect?" Archer said unkindly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if her father didn't say it, Veronica knew very well why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, have you ever considered the fact that Mason is the second son of the Reed family while you're using him?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean?" Archer stared at his daughter.</p></div>
