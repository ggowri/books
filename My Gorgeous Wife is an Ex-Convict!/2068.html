        <h1>Chapter 2066</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was about to speak when Kyla's phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla picked up the phone, and Martin Weiss caught a glimpse of the words &lsquo;Chase Harper&rsquo; on the caller ID.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Chase, what's the matter?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, keep an eye out for me and see if Juliet went to your place. If you see her, call me immediately." Chase Harper sounded anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. "What's wrong? Is Juliet missing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I brought her to the shop today. Then business got busy and she disappeared in a blink of an eye. I checked the surveillance footage and saw her riding her bicycle onto the street. She got out of the surveillance range. I've called the police. Juliet said she wanted to play with Nelson again, so I thought you could keep an eye out in case she goes over there," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even Chase Harper thought it was unlikely. After all, Juliet was only a three-year-old child. Although he had brought her to the store once, how could such a young child remember the route?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I'll keep an eye out for her. I'll look around the neighborhood too. Let me know if you find Juliet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," replied Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla called toward the back of the store for Mrs. Corbyn, and her mother came out to help keep an eye on the store. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Mrs. Corbyn walked out, she was a little stunned at the sight of Martin Weiss. Then, she asked her daughter, "What is he doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He just came to talk to me about Nelson. Ignore him." Kyla then told Mrs. Corbyn about Juliet's disappearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn immediately said, "Then hurry and find her! I'll look after the store, you can look around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla had just left the store when Martin Weiss said, "Get in my car, I'll drive you around. It's faster that way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla hesitated a little but got into Martin Weiss's car anyway. After all, finding Juliet was what mattered now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss started the car and drove slowly along the nearby road, while Kyla looked left and right to see if she could spot Juliet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you care about this child very much?" Martin Weiss asked somewhat jealously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The rare look of anxiety on her face seemed to be telling him silently how much she valued the child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I adore Juliet," replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss almost asked whether she just liked the child or if it was because her father was Chase Harper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla became more and more worried as they had driven three blocks but there was still no sign of Juliet or news from Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Children at the age of three were the most likely to be abducted and trafficked. Although Emerald City was pretty safe, they were still afraid of accidents happening to the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just as Kyla was about to call Grace to see if she could help find Juliet, Martin Weiss suddenly said, "Would you rather ask Grace for help than me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze before turning to look at Martin Weiss. Martin Weiss turned the steering wheel and parked the car at the roadside. Then, he took out a phone and dialed a number.</p></div>
