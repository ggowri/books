        <h1>Chapter 4064</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> While the two were chatting, Zabulon suddenly walked over with his senior sister to Tina and Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, can you help me with something?" Zabulon asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was taken aback, "What do you need help with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Well, since you haven't taken off your makeup yet, I want you to change your clothes and take a few photos with Kit to help him find his groove. Of course, since this is just a spur-of-the-moment idea, the client may not use the photos in the end, but if they do, you will be paid accordingly," his senior sister said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia was even more excited than Tina when she heard this, looking at Tina with anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina knew that if she didn't agree, Eugenia might make things difficult for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay," Tina agreed. After all, she also wanted to try what it feels like to shoot with her idol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> For her, it was also a fresh experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was taken to change her clothes and the makeup artist touched up her makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When everything was ready, she walked out and Eugenia was immediately impressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Oh my god! Tina, you look...so handsome!" Especially with the wig, black shirt, and matching pants with red gem accents, it exuded a neutral beauty. "If you were a man, I would really be willing to be an enemy with Chandler! The enemy of the rival!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was speechless. "Okay, do you have to be so exaggerated?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's really good-looking! It makes me so excited that my best friend is going to shoot with Kit!" Eugenia was still in an excited state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina walked up to Kit. "Hello, Kit, we meet again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You are..." Kit frowned, obviously not recognizing Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was only informed by his assistant that someone else would be shooting with him later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He didn't really care who he was shooting with, after all, since his debut, he had countless experiences shooting with other models or celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But when he saw the person in front of him, he was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This person's temperament and makeup were very eye-catching, making it hard to look away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "We met at the Reed family's wedding. You even gave me an autograph, remember?" Tina reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Is it you? Miss Stephenson?" Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, Tina was the only one who asked for his autograph at that event.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But is this person in front of him really the same as Tina? It was hard for him to imagine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, it's me!" Tina grinned. "I'm glad to be shooting with you today. I hope the rest of the shoot goes smoothly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I hope we have a pleasant collaboration," Kit said in a formal tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if a rich young lady has the best makeup and styling, how good can the photos be if it's just a hobby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit lowered his gaze, hiding the disdain that flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, in his eyes, Miss Stephenson probably bribed the photographer to shoot with him because she was a fan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, as the photographer said, "Let's begin!" Kit was suddenly stunned.</p></div>
