        <h1>Chapter 554</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could tell that Grace loved Jason very much. She thought about it but did not say anything. After all, Grace had been through a lot like her, and Grace must have thought about the concerns that came to her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only hope in her heart that Grace could have a happy ending, unlike her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina chatted with Grace in her spare time during the afternoon. Then, she let out a series of exultations when she learned that her best friend had gone to see the premiere of Howell Webb&rsquo;s movie. She only wished she had been there yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she started asking about Grace's meeting with Howell Webb yesterday and her photo with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sent Lina the photos she had taken on her phone yesterday. As for the signed photos and the posters Howell Webb gave her yesterday, she would have to take photos of them and send them to Lina after she got back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wow, I envy you so much for getting to see Howell Webb up close. I heard that he has a few more roadshows in Emerald City. I wonder if I can meet him!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to meet Howell Webb, talk to Hadwin and he'll find a way for you," said Grace. After all, Hadwin was the patriarch of the Stephenson family. He must have connections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It should be no trouble to arrange for Lina to meet Howell Webb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He..." Lina trembled. "Forget it." Hadwin pulled a long face every time she watched a video about Howell Webb as if she owed him millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Howell Webb was not the only one. There were also other idols and celebrities she was obsessed over. He would give her a dirty look as long as the celebrities were males.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she could only fangirl over them secretly. Was anyone as aggrieved as her in a relationship?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, she and he were just &lsquo;fake&rsquo; dating. If they were really dating, then she would probably have to stop being a fangirl. Lina thought of this and once again despised herself at the bottom of her heart. What came over her that she slept with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not have to be such a wimp now if she had not gotten drunk and slept with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To put it briefly, a single slip was causing her lasting sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help laughing when her best friend sent her a helpless meme. She still felt that Hadwin was not dating Lina for revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, there were many ways to take revenge, and Hadwin did not have to choose such a troublesome method. Even when they went to S City together last time, judging from Hadwin's words and deeds, and the way he looked at her best friend, she believed that Hadwin must have some feelings for Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, when Grace got back from work, she put the posters and signed photos that Howell Webb gave her on the tea table. Then, she took some photos and sent them to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chatting about celebrities with her best friend made Grace feel like she was back to who she was before the incident. It was a long-lost sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Jason was sitting on the sofa watching Grace typing and chatting with Lina. She was smiling while her hand occasionally touched Howell Webb's face on the poster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was the actor so attractive? Jason's eyes were fixed on Grace's hand, she... Was still touching it. She was still touching Howell Webb's face on the poster...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Big Boss Reed began to turn into the green-eyed monster, stretching out his arms to pull Grace into his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you done with them?" he asked.</p></div>
