        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him. So, did he really mean that she should do that intimate action to him like in the TV drama just now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And could she do it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most intimate thing between them before was probably just a kiss, but the TV scene just now was even more intense than a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However... it's true that if she wants to figure out what kind of feelings she has for him, being more intimate might help her make a better judgement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it okay that I did those things to you on TV?" Veronica murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to try it?" he asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another "try"?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She licked her dry lips and said, "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her in a daze. Although her face was blushing, her eyes showed a hint of determination. This contradictory and complex expression unexpectedly gave him a "seductive" feeling. In that moment, he felt his breathing become unsteady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was... a stirring feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been so long since he had felt this way. Perhaps this feeling that he had once </span><span>had was buried in the hypnotized emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." He simply answered with one word, and then his beautiful and deep black eyes stared straight at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica took a deep breath and leaned towards Mason, their lips touching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips were slightly cool, but soft. The scent emanating from his body was a faint smell of grass, which was quite pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They used to be the most familiar people, but now they were like strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her kiss unconsciously wanted to go deeper, and he cooperated by opening his lips, as if deliberately leading her to continue deepening the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt the blood rushing to her face and her heart beating faster. Could she have these feelings towards a "little brother"?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she really only saw him as a "little brother," then she should feel disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, not only did she not feel repulsed, but there was a faint sense of anticipation?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When this realization flashed through her mind, she was startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was she anticipating? Was she hoping for a scene from a TV drama where one person undresses the other?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her fingers were really unbuttoning his shirt, and her lips were kissing his neck and collarbone...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was something she had never done before, even when she was dating Daniel, they had never been this intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her most intimate act was given to him, and he was the most familiar male body to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica kept kissing the person in front of her, as if she was addicted to it, her mind even became blank, everything was done by instinct and heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until a moan brought her back to reality, she realized that his shirt had been torn open, revealing his tempting chest, and there were some faint red marks on his skin, probably caused by her kissing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his handsome face was now like a colorful cloud, especially charming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her want to do more to him... Oh my god, stop, stop! Veronica quickly stopped herself in her mind.</span></p></div>
