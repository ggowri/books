        <h1>Chapter 2454</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and Jason had not left the hospital at the time. When she came to the emergency room after hearing the news, she saw Martin Weiss sitting there. A doctor was stitching up his wound, while Kyla was lying on the hospital bed beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of the doctors from the hospital was treating Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were supposed to be in separate wards for two different treatments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss was in the same ward as Kyla. One side of Martin Weiss's cheeks was covered with blood, but his eyes kept looking at Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was not even worried about his injuries. He was only worried about Kyla's safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The reporters who stopped you yesterday were fake. They were impostors. We don't know what they want, but... it probably has something to do with the Mitchell family," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No matter who they're linked to, I'll find them," said Martin Weiss. Although Deer City was not his territory, it was not difficult for him to do this. "What about Kyla? How is she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She has woken up and agreed to return to Emerald City to wait for labor," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss chuckled at that. "Sure enough, she'll only listen to her friends." She did not even care about what he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "But the first thing she did when she woke up and saw me was to ask about how you&rsquo;re doing. Kyla isn't indifferent to you as you think she is. She cares about you more than you think."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyelashes quivered slightly. However, moments later, he looked up at Grace with sarcasm in his eyes. "Why are you telling me all this? Do you want me to feel something for her again? Is it because her liver is already failing and she might need a transplant after giving birth?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's expression froze. She had seen Kyla's examination report, so it was natural that Martin Weiss had seen it too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They shared a tacit understanding and told the doctor not to tell the patient about the need for another liver transplant as stated in the report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She needed a liver transplant, but Kyla had a special blood type. Donors who fit the bill were hard to find, and Martin Weiss was the most readily available choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss had already undergone a liver transplant, and the risk would be doubled if he were to donate his liver again. Besides, with Martin Weiss's feelings for Kyla now... Grace was not confident she could persuade Martin Weiss to donate his liver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's up to you whether you donate your liver or not. I only want you to know that Kyla has feelings for you. It's just like how she's willing to risk her life to have your baby because of her feelings for you. Otherwise, why would a woman risk her life for a man she doesn't love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss said to Grace, "I don't care if she loves me. As for donating my liver, why should I put my life in danger to save a woman who once hurt me like that? If I owe her, then I would&rsquo;ve already done enough by donating my liver, reversing her case, and saving her from the kidnappers.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, he looked coldly at Grace. "I, Martin Weiss, don't owe Kyla anything. So, you don't have to tell me anything. I'm tired and want to rest. Please leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Martin Weiss closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A look of worry was seen on Grace's face. If Kyla ever reached the point where she needed a liver transplant and Martin Weiss was unwilling to donate, then Kyla might... not be able to make it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace happened to see Jason's car as soon as she got out of the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason got out of his car and hurried over to her. "What happened? What's with the long face? You look like the sky is falling."</p></div>
