        <h1>Chapter 1298</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Her face was red as she bit on her lower lip. A few strands of hair fell down her cheeks. Her comely and sweet face gave off a wonderful sense of serenity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if just looking at her in silence would calm you down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the person in front of him with fascination. The thought of her wanting him and how she was blushing and feeling shy because of him made him happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to be more attracted to him, to have her heart beat for him, and to have her physically and mentally infatuated with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe this was the only way to make him feel more at ease and make sure she could not live without him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... not that you can't," he muttered, using one hand to unbutton his shirt while he used the other to take her hand. He let her hand slowly caress his cheek and then his jaw, neck, collarbone, chest...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little stunned. Her palms were also getting hotter and hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like it?" He smiled beautifully as if to catch her eye. He was willing to show her his beauty to captivate her gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was burning, and his smile was like the most intoxicating wine that was about to get her completely drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ye... Yes..." Her voice faltered a little, but she spoke frankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He breathed softly at her. "As long as you like it. See, everything I have is yours, and you can have it whenever you want. If you don't have enough strength, why don't I help you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This is pure seduction!' Grace felt as though she was going to get a nosebleed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body slowly moved closer to her, pleasing her in the gentlest way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she was willing to be tempted and enamored by him, he could give it all...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know how much I want her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know how much I love her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was uneasy, wondering if she would truly fall in love with him again one day and tell him she &lsquo;loved&rsquo; him as plainly as before instead of just trying hard to love him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He murmured the words that were lying in the deepest part of his heart. He was willing to give up his life to love her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace woke up the next day, her face immediately turned red as she recalled everything that had happened the night before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I was&hellip; Um... A little bold last night!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was unusually seductive, which made her understand a little why so many emperors in ancient times would skip the morning court and even give up their kingdom for beautiful women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out when one person was captivated by another, their body and mind would seem to be out of control and they would indulge in that tender feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that they were getting along more and more like before. She found their moments together sweet, and the feelings of estrangement and caution from before were slowly reducing. The two were getting along more and more naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He and she... were really starting over, and it was moving in the right direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her marriage was actually going better than she had imagined.</p></div>
