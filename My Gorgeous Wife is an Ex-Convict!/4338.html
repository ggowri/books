        <h1>Chapter 4336 Not So Liked</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley said lightly, "I'm doing quite well here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the person in front of her, who was a few years younger than her. Although her memory had not yet recovered, she also knew that they had been childhood playmates before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because of the age difference, we don't spend much time playing together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down in her heart, she had a natural liking for Harley, and she must be a very nice person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She is now able to reconcile smoothly with Chandler, and Chandler has not led out the insect in such a brutal way, and Harley has also helped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you like Lornell, why don't you take the initiative? "Tina said." Emotions sometimes rely on striving. If you really like that person, then you should be more proactive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it </span><span>like</span><span> the way you chased Chandler back then? "Harley said, and soon she realized she had said the wrong thing and couldn't help but apologize." Sorry, I forgot about you and my memory hasn't been restored yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, "Tina smiled." Although I haven't remembered the past, I've also learned a lot about my past with Chandler. You're right, just like when I chased Chandler."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley laughed mockingly and said, "But Tina, I'm different from you. Chandler has always liked and loved you since then. Your proactive pursuit will naturally receive a response, but I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, turned her head, and turned her gaze to Lornell, who was talking to someone. "Lornell, he doesn't like me. For him, the engagement with me was just a matter of curiosity and necessity. If I hadn't been dying and needed the Quentin family to heal me, I'm afraid I wouldn't have had this engagement at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's tone was filled with a sense of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina listened and remained silent for a moment: "So what about you? What do you think? If you really like him so much, then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, I realized that I don't seem to like it that much anymore, "Harley suddenly smiled, Tina, thank you for enlightening me. To be honest, I envy you and Chandler. You grew up together, faced difficulties together, and finally got together again. However, not every marriage contract made at a young age will have good results in the end. In those movies and TV dramas, many unmarried couples who have made contracts also end up breaking their contracts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was startled and said, "Do you want to break your engagement with Lornell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's tone of voice clearly suggests this idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The engagement of the Quentin family cannot be easily dissolved, "Harley said slowly." Perhaps as you said, since you like it, you need to work hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, she is already trapped in a contradiction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the one hand, she knew that Lornell didn't love her, and even didn't have that kind of male-female relationship with her, but it was just a habit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similarly, she also understood that emotions are not something that comes with hard work. Just one person working hard cannot succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, there was still a reluctance in her heart. She really liked Lornell, but after being treated with indifference time and time again, this liking gradually cooled down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, terminating the engagement would bring significant losses to the Hart family, and as a last resort, she did not want to terminate the engagement like this.</span></p></div>
