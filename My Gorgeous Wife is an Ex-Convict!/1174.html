        <h1>Chapter 1173</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared somewhat blankly at him. The man's face was full of worry for her. There were faint dark circles under his eyes. He must not have slept well last night. Besides, he had told her he had many things to handle at the Stephenson family&rsquo;s house, but now, he was back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina held Hadwin Stephenson's face with both her hands. "Let's get married. I'll marry you once you've settled the Stephenson family&rsquo;s matters!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although they had talked about getting married, for the first time, she desperately wanted to marry him and be with him after going through a life-and-death situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to spend as much time with him as possible, even if it was just a minute or a second more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she cherished him more now after experiencing such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when they were just standing face to face and holding each other while looking at each other, she thought that this was all a blessing from God!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stared at the person in front of him and bent down, pressing his forehead gently against hers. "We'll get married. I want to marry you into the Stephenson family so you can be my wife gloriously!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gave a sweet, tearful smile. She did not care whether it was glorious; she only cared whether they could be together forever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to be with him for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the living room of the Sweeney family's house, the tears in Lina's eyes were not yet dry. She sat in the living room with Hadwin Stephenson and faced the interrogation of her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to get married?" asked Mr. Sweeney as he looked at his daughter and future son-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He and his wife were satisfied with Hadwin Stephenson and were supportive of their daughter's relationship, but marriage... was a little too fast. They had only been dating for less than a year!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I want to marry Lina. I hope you two can give us your blessings," said Hadwin Stephenson. His hand had been holding Lina's since they entered the Sweeney family's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Sweeney could not help saying, "Hadwin, you haven't been dating Lina that long, have you? It's not that you're not good, but... marriage is for life. You should get to know each other well before making a decision. We don't want you to take marriage too lightly and casually get married on a whim."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney's opinion, if a couple got married in haste, then maybe the couple would get divorced in haste too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, getting to know someone doesn't only depend on the length of time you know them. I think I know Hadwin quite well!" Lina could not help saying. She even knew his underwear size. "Didn't you keep pushing me to get married when I didn&rsquo;t have a boyfriend? Now that I'm going to get married, you're... asking me to slow down?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Sweeney glared at her daughter. They were only thinking of her, but their daughter was not understanding at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's too soon, regardless!" Mr. Sweeney made the final decision. "We're not against you dating, but you should think through a big deal such as marriage!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney spoke. Then, he looked at Hadwin Stephenson again and said, "The situation of the Stephenson family now... is a bit of a mess. It's been in the news a lot. I don't want my daughter to marry and get involved in a rich and powerful family&rsquo;s feud."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, knowing his daughter, she would turn out the loser if they fought like it was a palace drama.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said with great affirmation, "I'm not going to let Lina get involved in any of it. In two months at most, I can solve everything in the Stephenson family. Then I'll let Lina join a peaceful Stephenson family. Besides&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused and turned to look at the person beside him. "I've loved Lina for far more than a year. It should have been more than four years since I first met her. My decision to marry her was never one made lightly but more seriously than any decision I&rsquo;ve ever made!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze returned to Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney again with an incomparable determination in it. "I want to marry Lina. She's the only one I ever want to marry. It has nothing to do with time!"</p></div>
