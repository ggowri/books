        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the bodyguards quickly left, while the other bodyguard blocked Calvert's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you don't want me to take you home, then wait here, "Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's eyes flashed with confusion, not understanding what she wanted him to wait for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he did not refute but obediently stayed where he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she doesn't go to his house, it's okay to stay for a while. At least, he actually wants to spend more time with her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An inexplicable emotion slowly spread through his body, but he didn't understand what this emotion was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because she saved him twice?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or is it because a princess like her is so towering that if it were normal, he wouldn't have had the opportunity to have such contact?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or perhaps she seems somewhat different from those women who approach him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those women always look at him with a greedy gaze and deliberately approach him, but once they find trouble and lose interest in him, they will not hesitate to discard him, like garbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> the woman's gaze made him feel extremely nauseous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had never looked at him with such a gaze. Her gaze was just the ordinary one, without lofty charity or that disgusting desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's like he's just an ordinary person in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This makes him feel more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you help me? "Calvert hesitated for a moment, breaking the silence at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley asked strangely, "Don't you want me to help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! "He quickly denied," I just don't understand why you helped me, after all, I shouldn't be of much use to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it not common for me to come forward and help someone who I know when I see them being beaten? "Harley said</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it average? Calvert pursed her lips, perhaps for her, it was just a simple matter, just like ordinary people casually throwing something to eat when they see a kitten or puppy on the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you often help others like this? "He couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not often, I'm not actually the kind of person who is willing to help others, "Harley said, after all, born into a family like hers, there are too many people who approach her for for-profit purposes, and there are too many people who pretend to be pitiful in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, when she was a child, she was a very compassionate person, but after so many years, she gradually became indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless she is familiar with someone, she rarely takes the initiative to help others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Calvert, helped twice, which is quite rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because of his numbness when he was beaten that she couldn't help but want to help him once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Hart family's bodyguard returned, carrying a plastic bag with something inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard handed the bag to Harley, who looked at the contents of the bag and then said to Calvert, "Here is some medicine. You can apply it to the wound after you go home, but it's only for external use. If you still have any discomfort, you should go to the hospital promptly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert took the plastic bag in a daze and looked at the medicine in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is the medicine she gave him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, some women gave him things, such as chocolates and various snacks to express love, as well as clothes, gloves, and scarves. However, she was the first woman to give him medicine!</span></p></div>
