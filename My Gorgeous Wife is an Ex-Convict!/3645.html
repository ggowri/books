        <h1>Chapter 3643</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence inside the carriage prompted him to make this phone call, wanting to hear her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you on my side of town now?" Jasper asked anxiously, "At the front door?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you planning to come in?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's already late," he murmured, "I just really want to hear your voice, Jasper. Can you talk to me for a little longer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice carried a sense of brokenness, sounding different from usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suddenly felt a sense of unease, unsure of why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up, holding her phone, and walked out of the room, quickly descending the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, what's wrong? Did something happen today?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing happened, I was just staying in the villa alone and got a bit bored, so I came out for a while," he said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she knew him too well and naturally sensed his deliberate act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Jasper quickened her pace, "Then wait for me outside now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came out to find you," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, it's already late, I'll drive back in a while," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me, I'll be there right away!" she insisted, "I want to see you, I really want to see you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her footsteps had changed from walking to running. When she reached the iron gate of the mansion and opened it, she saw a silver-gray car parked right at the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was William's car!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And sitting inside the car, William also saw Jasper. He immediately opened the car door and got out quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper put away her phone and looked at William's pale cheeks. She lifted her hand and suddenly placed the palms of her hands on his cheeks, instantly feeling a cool sensation coming from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your face is so cold," she said. "And your complexion looks really bad. Something must have happened, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her in a daze, feeling the warmth of her hands on his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, we're boyfriend and girlfriend. If something unhappy has happened to you, please tell me. I don't want to be completely clueless about what's going on with my own boyfriend," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently rubbed his cheek against the palm of her hand and slowly opened his thin lips. "I went to the hospital and met Harold and Rate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was shocked. "You went to see them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wanted to ask them why they came to Emerald City and why they disturbed my life!" William's voice was filled with bitterness. "Ironically, their reason was that they missed me so much, that I am their only flesh and blood. They wanted me to forgive them for abandoning me in the past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Jasper remained silent, looking at the intense bitterness on his face, feeling a wave of heartache in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do they have the right to easily abandon me and then so easily disrupt my current life, asking me to forgive them?" William said. "If this is what blood ties are, then I'd rather not have their blood running through my veins!"</span></p></div>
