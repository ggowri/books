        <h1>Chapter 1104</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the end of the day, his heart was still in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I hope you can cherish me and me alone. I'll cherish you more than anyone else..." Jason said as drowsiness gradually swept over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Holding her hand like this made him feel secure and satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, Grace slowly turned her head and looked at Jason who had fallen asleep on the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no idea when she fell asleep. All she remembered was that she seemed to be watching Jason's face and as she watched on&hellip; she fell asleep?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a good thing Jason was not in the room now, and that saved her some embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got out of bed and washed up. She walked out of the room and went downstairs, only to find Jason in the kitchen preparing breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're awake. Breakfast will be ready in a minute," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him as he busied himself in the kitchen. During her few days here, he did all the cooking except when he had a cold, and that was when she would prepare the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had never watched him prepare the food and it was something new to see it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, as he had said, it was ready in a minute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">White porridge, steamed buns, a few dishes, and dried beancurd sheets&mdash;it was a very Chinese-style breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the breakfast in front of her, Grace guessed that few people in Emerald City had ever eaten breakfast prepared by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you... sleep well after I fell asleep yesterday?" she could not help asking as she ate the white porridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's my line. I probably went to sleep earlier than you yesterday," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was rendered speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But when I woke up this morning, you were..." Jason wanted to speak but stopped on second thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said quickly, "What did I do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. You were just leaning over the edge of the bed with your face in my direction like you had been watching me all night," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face immediately turned red. 'No way. I... never changed position after falling asleep?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Were you watching me after I fell asleep yesterday?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face immediately turned redder. 'Come on, how am I going to answer that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled and looked at Grace with an enchanting look in his eyes. "So, you really were watching me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not all throughout, just for a while..." Halfway through the sentence, she stopped immediately. 'God, am I stupid? I can't believe I said that. Isn&rsquo;t that admitting that I was indeed watching him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, after she said that, the enchanting gleam in his eyes seemed to grow stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Uneasily, she continued to eat her porridge. Once she finished the porridge in her bowl, she said, "Don't you have to go to work?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he was the president of Reed Group! Was it a good idea for him to stay here with her like this? She did not seem to have seen him leave the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "I can handle the company here too. If I said I&rsquo;ll stay here with you until you fall in love with me, I will."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly. "Keeping me here won't make any difference."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There&rsquo;s a difference. At least, you&rsquo;re not rejecting me as much as you did at the beginning, right?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned.</p></div>
