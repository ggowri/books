        <h1>Chapter 2129</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Give her to me," the little boy said to the doctor, who was holding the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor hesitated. After all, she had seen the little boy feed the mother blood. She immediately regained consciousness after that and delivered the baby. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... she would be held responsible if something happened after she handed the baby to the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Give him the baby. I'll take responsibility if anything happens!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After what happened, her faith in the boy had increased. Something told her the boy could save the baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor then handed the baby to the little boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy took the baby, lowered his head, and kissed the baby that was not breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah!" Everyone was taken aback at this sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The boy's lips pressed against the baby's lips. Upon closer inspection, Grace realized it was not as simple as just a kiss. Instead, the boy seemed to be sucking something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Finally, his lips parted from the baby, and he spat something out. It was a muddy discharge mixed with amniotic fluid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctors and nurses seemed shocked. They had already cleaned the secretion from the baby's throat with instruments. Who knew there was still residue?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A baby's cry rang out in the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Everyone was finally relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After hearing her daughter cry, Lina finally fainted with a smile on her lips!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, Lina, what's come over you? Don't frighten me!" Hadwin Stephenson shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor, who had been treating Lina, said, "Mr. Stephenson, the mother is stable now. She probably just fainted from exhaustion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson let out a sigh of relief at this. 'As long as Lina is okay!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson and Lina went to the ward first, while the newborn underwent examinations and evaluations by the doctors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Kyla felt like they had gone through a battle. However, when they came out of the delivery room, the little boy was gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where's the kid?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla shook her head. She was so focused on Lina and the baby that she did not know where the little boy had gone either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They got out of the delivery room. Jason and Martin Weiss walked up to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did that kid really save Lina and the newborn baby?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace nodded. Though she witnessed it herself, her head felt like it was in the clouds. Everything... seemed unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"By the way, did you see that little boy come out?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, a couple of men picked him up," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Picked him up?" Grace froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They were very respectful to him. His family probably sent them. The kid's probably no ordinary person," said Jason. Then, he looked at the time. "Alright, it's late now. Let's get something to eat first. The doctor said Lina won't wake up for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked apologetically at Kyla as if she had just come to her senses. "I'm sorry to have kept you starving, Kyla."</p></div>
