        <h1>Chapter 1818</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Take responsibility. How are you going to take responsibility?" Mr. Sweeney snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If I live, I'll marry Lina. If I die, then Lina will be the beneficiary of all my fortune after my death," Hadwin Stephenson said directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The three members of the Sweeney family were immediately stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina only thought that what Hadwin Stephenson said was strange. Who would say things like that? It was as if he was going to die at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're taking responsibility?" Lina asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at Lina. "Then why don't you take responsibility for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What he said instantly made Lina speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney's anger was slightly calmed by what Hadwin Stephenson said. "Are you really willing to take responsibility?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes!" Hadwin Stephenson said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney looked at the man in front of him. He was previously extremely optimistic about him and even thought that this man was worthy of taking care of his daughter. However, what happened afterward was like a hard slap in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Was he going to hand over his daughter to this man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you knew it would come to this, why did you do that in the first place? If you really had feelings for Lina, you wouldn't have broken up with her when she was still in the hospital. Do you know how she survived during that period?" Mr. Sweeney felt heartbroken as he recalled the way his daughter looked lying on the hospital bed back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Dad!" said Lina. She knew what happened back then was a wound in her parents' hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry," said Hadwin Stephenson. All he could say were these few words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The Sweeney family doesn't need your apology. That's all for today. You can go home first!" Mr. Sweeney said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pressed his thin lips slightly and turned to look at Lina. "Lina, I have to go. And... a week. All I'm asking for is one week."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina frowned. She had no idea why he wanted one week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson left the Sweeney family&rsquo;s house. Mr. Sweeney looked at his daughter and said, "Hadwin Stephenson's willing to take responsibility. What do you think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I don't know," stammered Lina. She was conflicted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You don't know?" Mr. Sweeney's voice rose abruptly. "You're already pregnant, and you don't know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney also said, "Lina, just tell us whatever is on your mind. We're on your side no matter what!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I know marrying Hadwin Stephenson is the best choice for me, our family, and the baby. If I have a baby out of wedlock, the neighbors will probably spread horrible rumors, and people will judge us, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's voice could not help breaking a little as she spoke, "I'm scared that even if we marry for the baby, perhaps he&rsquo;ll ask for a divorce over something else at some point. I don't know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she and he were madly in love, she never thought that they would break up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, reality had whacked her in the head and told her that nothing was impossible!</p></div>
