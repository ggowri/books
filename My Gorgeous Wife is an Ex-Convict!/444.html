        <h1>Chapter 443</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;The kitchenware and bedding can be sold at the second-hand shop later when I pass by it. As for the clothes and shoes, I can still wear them, so I&rsquo;ll take them back.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the clothes and shoes that Grace wanted to take back. They were old clothing. Although the quality looked good, the styles were outdated and some of the colors had faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason understood that these clothes were probably those she owned before going into prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not say anything. After all, even if he wanted to give her money to spend and told her to buy new ones, he still had to do it slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that if he rushed into it, he would frighten her. She was only beginning to let down her defenses in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you wait for me here? I&rsquo;ll be back soon,&rdquo; Grace said. Then, she picked up the kitchenware and bedding that she had packed to bring them to the second-hand shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was quicker than her and took the stuff from her. &ldquo;Let me carry them. Please open the door for me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she responded and went to the door to open it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked out of the house while carrying the bag of kitchenware in one hand and the bedding in the other hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly closed the door and caught up with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I carry something? My hands are empty.&rdquo; Grace offered as she felt bad seeing Jason with his hands full.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need. You just lead the way in front.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tone was firm when he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not argue further and led the way. The corner of her eyes occasionally glanced at Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked like a laborer working in the city on his way back to his hometown for the festive season. Yet with his suit and tie, coupled with his handsome facial features, it was a contrasting image.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;I suppose that he has never done this before.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They finally reached the junction. Grace saw the man who usually collected old stuff and went forward. &ldquo;Mister, I have some kitchenware and old bedding. Will you take them?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; The man smiled widely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he saw a well-dressed Jason carrying the bunch of old stuff in, he was stunned for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man checked the items and mumbled to himself. Then, he pulled Grace to the side and whispered, &ldquo;Young lady, don&rsquo;t be fooled by appearances. The man might dress well and look good, but he may not be good on the inside. He may look well-dressed, but if he&rsquo;s truly rich, he would not ask you to sell these items to get some money. He would have asked you to just throw these away.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace understood that the uncle was just on the lookout for her, thus she said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my boyfriend, and I think I know him quite well.&rdquo; She knew his family background, his personality, where his house was, and his family members... She had seen his old man as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although, she could not say that she had a good experience meeting Old Master Reed for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man sighed, thinking that Grace was in too deep that he could not help her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace managed to sell that bunch of old items for 100 dollars. After she received the money from the man, she and Jason went back to the rented unit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What did the uncle say to you just now?&rdquo; he suddenly asked. He had noticed the man speaking to her in private earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace teased. &ldquo;The uncle advised me to be careful so that I won&rsquo;t be cheated by you. Would you lie to me?&rdquo;</p></div>
