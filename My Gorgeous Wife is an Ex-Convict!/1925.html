        <h1>Chapter 1923</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's eyes instantly widened as she thought of the moment her hand was about to slip between his fingers after the building exploded. He had said... "Grace, how could you... How could you do this again? If... you&rsquo;re gone, how can I live..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What does he mean by saying again? Does he remember...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace shuddered as a touch of disbelief flashed across her eyes. She was scared that she was overthinking it when it was not the case at all...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As if seeing the confusion in her eyes, he said, "You chose to fall into the sea at the cliff back then to save me. I couldn't hold your hand at the time, so I didn't save you. This time, I had to grab your hand. I&rsquo;ll always hold your hand and never let go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stared blankly at Jason as her eyes reddened. 'So he has really regained his memory? Does he remember the truth of why I fell into the sea?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason took Grace's hand with some difficulty, placed her hand on his cheek, and rubbed it gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His movements were slow, but there was infinite tenderness and affection in every move. "Grace... I won't let go of your hand, and you can't either... Got it? I have no reason to live if you no longer exist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;But our children. They&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace typed on her phone with her other hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason asked, "Do you want me to live and raise the kids because we have them? But Grace, do you know that... it was the cruelest thing when you wanted me to keep on living? I would probably... have lost my mind if my memories weren't erased from hypnosis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Have you really... recovered your memories? Do you remember everything?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace typed, feeling anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I've recovered my memories. When I watched your hand slip out of my fingertips, all those memories that I didn't remember before came flooding back into my mind," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not until that moment did he realize that what she said back then was all true. The woman loved him with everything she had! She never wanted to run away from him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason muttered, "Grace, some people can survive losing the people they love the most, but some can't. So don't ever give me such a request if that happens."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she was no longer around, all he wanted was to be with her. Whether in heaven or hell, he just wanted to be with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The end of his life had never been scary to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The only thing he was afraid of was losing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stared blankly at the man in front of her. Her hand was full of his temperature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a long time, she finally said yes, and tears could not stop falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This man's love for her made her so distressed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's injury was much less severe than Jason's injuries. He needed help to get out of bed.</p></div>
