        <h1>Chapter 1493</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace calmed herself down and said to Lily, "If you let me go, I'll forget everything that has happened between us. I can also ask Jay to let you go and help the Atkinson family go through this crisis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What she had to do now was try and tempt Lily with these conditions to make her hesitate. Only in this way could she create more opportunities to escape. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was just that no matter how good Grace&rsquo;s offers were, Lily did not seem to care. "Grace, I just want to know if Jason is willing to risk his life for you! This man didn't even shed a tear when my sister died! Don't you want to know how far he&rsquo;ll go for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily's eyes burst with hatred as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She hated Grace! How did she, the Atkinson family's second heiress, turn out like this just because of a nobody like Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had stolen Sean from Grace back then. She thought Sean would love her deeply, but he abandoned her just like he did Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I'm Lily, the goddess in the hearts of thousands of men! How can I be less than Grace? Jason will also discard Grace and sacrifice her. I'm sure of it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, if she did as that man surnamed Wang told her, she would receive enough money for her to live happily abroad!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, several black cars drove over one after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace saw many people getting out of the cars, and Jason was among them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason also saw Grace and the current state of the car she was in. His face instantly paled as he rushed toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't come over! There are bombs around the car. They'll explode!" cried out Grace, stopping Jason from running over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's steps came to a sudden halt, and so did those following him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace momentarily breathed a sigh of relief and looked at the men standing just a dozen meters away from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not expect this to happen in only a few hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was lucky that the car windows were not rolled up, so her voice could still be heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, don't be afraid, I... I'll get you out of here!" Jason said with a pale face, his hands trembling slightly at his sides. At this moment, he seemed more afraid than Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help feeling assured. She believed that he would be able to save her. She and the children would be safe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lily brought me here! My hands are tied to the steering wheel and handbrake. I can't move. Lily is on a video call with me on the phone..." Grace quickly explained her current situation to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could sense that Lily was now a little abnormal. It was impossible to persuade Lily to disarm the bombs and let Grace go through video call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Frowning, Jason suddenly grabbed Secretary Wang, whom the bodyguards had carried out of the car. "You got Lily onboard?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang smiled. "Yes, you and Grace have made her so miserable. Of course, she's bent on getting back at you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pondered for a moment and instructed his subordinates, "Call the police and ask them to send over their bomb specialists."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang smiled and said, "It's no use. It's too late. The bombs around the car would&rsquo;ve already exploded when the experts arrive. Of course, if you don't want Grace to be blown up or fall into the sea, you can choose to save her life."</p></div>
