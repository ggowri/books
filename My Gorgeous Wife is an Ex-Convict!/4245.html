        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know either," Tina replied honestly, "maybe just do nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Kit had already refused her help and didn't want to see her again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, it would be best if they didn't meet at all given their current relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever she saw Kit, she would think of the time they spent together, and it would also remind her of how he deceived her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to do something, I can help you," Chandler offered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at him strangely, "Would you help me no matter what I want to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" he replied without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it's something bad? Something that would make you uncomfortable, would you still help?" she continued to ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," he affirmed again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina bit her lip slightly, "Why are you willing to do this? Just because you love me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you are Tina," he said softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the fact that she was Tina was more important to him than the fact that he loved her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt somewhat helpless, his kindness towards her was simply beyond her comprehension.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because of her amnesia, she couldn't understand why he loved her so much!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, Tina and Chandler made plans to go see a photography exhibition together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina arrived at the venue first, only to unexpectedly see a familiar figure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Kit!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback, she hadn't expected to run into Kit in a place like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit was standing in front of a group of photos, completely focused and engrossed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina hesitated, considering whether to pretend she hadn't seen him and continue looking at the exhibition or go and say hello, or perhaps just leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could make up her mind, someone walked up to Kit, grabbed him by the collar, and seemed to say something menacing. Kit's expression immediately changed, and they both left together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina furrowed her brow, a sense of foreboding lingering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way that man looked at Kit was filled with violent cruelty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Kit had some sort of enemy?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, Tina instinctively followed them, but when she reached the entrance of the venue, she didn't see Kit or that person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she felt somewhat disappointed, she suddenly heard someone passing by hurriedly say, "There seemed to be a fight in the alley just now, it was really brutal. I didn't dare to intervene!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you stop it? If you had intervened, you might have been beaten too! Didn't you see that the person who was fighting had several accomplices with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we call the police?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of calling the police? Aren't you afraid that the person who was fighting will find out your phone number and come after you for revenge?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Tina's sense of foreboding grew stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that the person who was beaten up was Kit...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which alley?" she grabbed one of the people who were talking and asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's this alley right next to us," the other person pointed in the direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina immediately rushed towards the alley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey!" a passerby tried to shout at her, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, two passersby stood there, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she going to save the person who got beaten up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the person who got beaten up her friend? But if she goes over, others might beat her up too!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't we call the police?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another voice rang out, "What did you guys just say?"</span></p></div>
