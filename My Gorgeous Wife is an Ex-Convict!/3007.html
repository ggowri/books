        <h1>Chapter 3005</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason's next sentence made the couple tense up again after they had just relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, these two are the President of Hart Group, Brian, and his girlfriend Valda, who happens to be Miss Theller's former art teacher."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The couple was dumbfounded on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hart Group?! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be that this Brian is the entertainment industry's young master?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now they have provoked... the Crown Prince?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yvo immediately raised his hand and slapped Wendy in the face, saying "Look at what you've done! How dare you accuse others of falsely accusing you? You need to go back to school and apologize to the teacher."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wendy covered her cheeks, angry but unable to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yvo bowed to Brian and Valda, saying, "Mr. Hart, Miss Theller, I'm sorry about this. We will handle it properly and make sure that Miss Theller's teacher gets justice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His attitude was completely different from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the Reed family, Valda remained silent and didn't speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just feel like some people's attitudes change too quickly, like flipping a switch," Valda sighed. "If it was just me standing in front of them today, they probably wouldn't have paid any attention. And if I tried to clear Mr. Yeats' name through normal channels, I would probably face a lot of obstacles and it wouldn't be so easy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just feel like power and status are really useful," Valda sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she didn't like using her status to solve problems, she had to admit that it was the fastest way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's only useful against people who are opportunistic and afraid of power," Brian murmured. "If you meet someone who is upright and unyielding, it may not be useful. Besides, there are many things in this world that power and status can't buy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was slightly startled, as she could only see his profile due to him driving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thing that couldn't be exchanged... could it be referring to Grace? This thought crossed her mind at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that he had spent many years of his youth for Grace, and she also knew how much he longed for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was treating her well now, and she was extremely certain of his affection for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But that feeling he had for Grace, for them, perhaps it was still like a time bomb, not knowing when it would explode.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, it's also possible that he had already fallen in love with her before this bomb exploded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least, the future has endless possibilities, and at the moment she decided to date him again, she had already thought through everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyway, she had to try her best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? You've been staring at me." His voice sounded, pulling her out of her trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing, I just think what you said is right." Valda said, then changed the subject, "By the way, when will the Yvo couple clear Mr. Yeats' name and let the school revoke the decision to transfer him?"</p></div>
