        <h1>Chapter 2561</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of Amber Mitchell, Grace began to frown again. "You said the last time that Simon isn't doing okay. Can Amber Mitchell really save the child if she helps him with the transfusion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's a certain possibility, but it isn't very high," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That... That boy..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"With the Gregory family's ability, they can keep the child alive even if the transfusion isn't successful. He's just not going to be that healthy," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed, now thankful that her triplets were healthy despite the rough labor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a mother, what she wanted most was for her children to be healthy and safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect Simon to be George Gregory and Amber Mitchell's child. Amber Mitchell thought she gave birth to a stillborn child. If George Gregory had saved Amber Mitchell when she was admitted to the mental hospital, everything would have been different," Grace lamented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There aren't so many what-ifs in this world. George Gregory is doomed to live in regret and pain for the rest of his life." The deeper the love, the deeper the pain and regret!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed. "George Gregory has hurt Amber Mitchell too much. Even though they have a child together, Amber Mitchell... won't forgive him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After spending time with Amber Mitchell, Grace learned that Amber Mitchell was a woman who had a clear-cut stand on what she liked and what she did not. Once she made up her mind, she would never go back on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she could see that there were no more past feelings in Amber Mitchell's eyes when Amber Mitchell faced George Gregory. It was clear that Amber Mitchell no longer loved George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I can't believe that Amber Mitchell would choose to marry Herman Moss. Is it alright for her to wallow in the past like this?" In her opinion, one should always look ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "How would you know a person's true feelings if you're not them? Maybe this is the best for her. If she loves Herman Moss, it won&rsquo;t be a bad thing. At least she&rsquo;ll be happier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze slightly before chuckling. "Since it's what Amber Mitchell wants to do, maybe... it's good for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, her gaze fell on Jason's face. "Jay, let's not have any misunderstandings. Look, it&rsquo;s so sad that George Gregory and Amber Mitchell got to this point because of a misunderstanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We won't." He raised his hand and pulled her into his arms. "We'll never become that way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never be as stupid as George Gregory, ruining all his good chances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Deer City. Amber Mitchell continued to stay in her rental house as if she had nothing to do with the chaos outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not care whether George Gregory and Louise Mitchell got divorced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the person who harmed her had been jailed and punished. She had married Herman as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even had Herman's things in her place now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were Herman's clothes in the closet. That photo of her and Herman that was taken secretly and a photo of Herman alone were on the nightstand. Herman's favorite books were also on the shelf.</p></div>
