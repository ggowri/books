        <h1>Chapter 1530</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed adopted Oriel Lynch because Little Young Master saw the Lynch mother-and-daughter pair being bullied. He said he wanted a little sister," Terrence quickly explained. He was afraid Grace would misunderstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Little Young Master is Mick, right?" Grace got excited when she brought up the son she had yet to meet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, you can meet Little Young Master when he comes back from kindergarten later," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What about the other child? I was pregnant with triplets. I only had Jasper with me when I woke up in the hospital. Do you have two kids here?" Grace asked hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence and Uncle Kwan showed a regretful look on their faces. "No, we only have Little Young Master here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace only felt her heart suddenly being emptied out. A sore tingling feeling spread from her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she had thought about the possibility, it still hurt when she found out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I was carrying three babies! And now there are only two left? Is the other child alive or dead? Where are they?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"When Secretary Wang handed Little Young Master to the Reed family, he said only one child had survived but isn't Little Young Lady alive too? Perhaps the other child's alive as well," said Uncle Kwan. He had already addressed Jasper as &lsquo;Little Young Lady&rsquo;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, she was the Reed family's true heiress!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace heaved a sigh of relief. 'Yes, maybe the other child is alive too! Secretary Wang should know about all this best. Secretary Wang must know whether the child is alive or dead!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you know where Secretary Wang is?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence said, "After hypnotizing Young master Reed, Secretary Wang was arrested by the police for wounding and kidnapping. However, he escaped before the trial and no one knows where he is now. I went to the police station with Young master Reed today because we got word from the police station that they had a lead on Secretary Wang's whereabouts. We went to confirm it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace shuddered, and her breathing quickened again. "Are they going to find Secretary Wang soon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, the Reed family will also send people to assist the police in tracking down Secretary Wang's whereabouts!" said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That was when they thought only Little Young Master had survived, but now it seemed that it was not the case. Even if for no other reason than finding out the whereabouts of the last child, they would dig three feet deep to find Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, there was a sudden scream from the second floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The three in the living room looked up and saw a maid standing not far from the stairway. She was staring hesitantly at a room at the end of the corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Where's Little Young Lady?" Uncle Kwan looked up and saw that the maid was the one he had assigned to take care of Little Young Lady, so he asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The Little Young Lady... entered Young master Reed's study," the maid said, looking reluctant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Young master Reed's study was not somewhere everyone could enter. Even Little Young Master could upset Young master Reed if he barged into the study randomly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Little Young Lady had just returned. If she made Young master Reed mad... Terrence and Uncle Kwan could not help but worry when they thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At the moment, the adult and the child were staring at each other in the study.</p></div>
