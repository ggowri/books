        <h1>Chapter 3087</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you saying that her feelings for me are now unable to overcome that sense of inferiority?" Brian interjected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda now has a limp in one leg. Patrick analyzed that her mindset may change due to this and also due to her disappearance, which may have caused some experiences that could affect her mindset."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian murmured, "Is it because of insecurity?" Is it because of her insecurity that she doesn't want to believe him when he says he loves her? Is it because of her insecurity that she doesn't want to see him? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But the feeling of inferiority is completely unfamiliar to him, something he has never experienced before, yet it has always been present by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How much about their past relationship does he not know?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After guessing this possibility, all that remained in his heart was more pain... pain for this foolish woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille helped Valda move all her things back to the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Brian often cleans the apartment himself, so there is no accumulation of dust or anything like that. Everything is normal, and now we can skip the step of cleaning the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you like me to stay here with you for a few days?" said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't need it," Valda said. "Camille, I know you're worried about me and want to take care of me more, but... really, I don't need it. Even though my leg is injured, I still want to try to be as normal as possible. If you keep trying to take care of me like this, I'll only feel more uncomfortable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, I, I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I understand," Valda smiled slightly. "You don't need to apologize to me. Everything can be just like before! By the way, now that I'm back, I want to start working hard again and earn money to support myself. As an editor, you wouldn't want to let me go, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could that be? I'll help you come up with a work plan so that you can gradually return to your normal work," said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thanks!" said Valda. "Also, over the years, I've saved up some money and I want to buy another apartment of around 90 square meters with two bedrooms and two living rooms. When it's time to look at properties, I may need you to come with me and give me some advice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What, you don't live in this house anymore?" Camille asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This place is a bit small and only has one bedroom. I plan to have my godmother come and live with me in the future, so I want to buy a bigger place. As for this house, I will rent it out in the future and collect some rent." said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Godmother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's the person I told you about who saved my life. She saved me when I was like a vegetable lying there for 10 months. She didn't give up on me and did everything she could to save me, which allowed me to recover." Valda said, deeply grateful to Lisa. "If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be alive. So later on, I recognized her as my godmother. She has no children and lives alone in the village. This time I came back, I wanted to settle down here first, and then bring her over to live with me."</p></div>
