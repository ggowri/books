        <h1>Chapter 2179</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The person took Jason and the rest to a private room. They respectfully opened the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when Jason, Grace, and the rest went in, they found that Philip Barlow was the only one in the private room. William was not there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper Reed's expression, which had been full of expectation, instantly sank. "Where's William? Why isn't he here?" Jasper asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William has a class today and can't come, but he knew you were coming and asked me to take good care of you," Philip Barlow replied to Jasper with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper said, "Where is he having his class? I'll go to him. I have something to give him in person, and I want to apologize to him. I... I found out he didn't push Nelson down the stairs but saved him instead. Otherwise, Nelson would have been shot with an air gun."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow raised his eyebrows and looked at Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace then told Philip Barlow about what exactly had happened. "It's a misunderstanding. Everyone misunderstood William. I came over to talk to William about this, and the two children want to apologize to him as well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow smiled slightly and said, "It's good that everything has been cleared up. I'll tell William that you apologized when I get back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he looked at Jasper Reed. "If you have something to give to William, I can pass it to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Pass it?' Jasper froze for a moment before shaking her head. She wanted to hand her apology card to William in person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">More importantly, she wanted to see William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Uncle Barlow, I want to see William. Tell me where he's taking his class. I... I'll go and find him!" Jasper pleaded with him. Her big almond-shaped eyes were already a little wet with anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow gazed at the little girl in front of him. She was pretty but not exactly stunning. However, his only son cared very much about this little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Does my son long for this kid because she... showed my son kindness when he was at his worst?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It seems a little dangerous.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, Philip Barlow said slowly, "Let's just say that William doesn't wish to see you right now. I had arranged for him to come here with me today, and I helped him take a day off from his class, but he would rather go there than come here. You needn't go look for him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper widened her eyes with surprise on her face. "He... He doesn't want to see us?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, even though you&rsquo;ve found out you misunderstood him, what&rsquo;s done is done. He's upset that he was misunderstood, so he doesn&rsquo;t want to see you for a while. How about this? I'll ask him if he wants to meet you after some time. If he wants to meet you, I'll bring him to Emerald City to meet you. What do you think?" Philip Barlow spoke kindly, looking just like a kind uncle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes, understanding that Philip Barlow was trying to cut off contact between the children so that their affection for each other would fade naturally. When they saw each other less, they would be less important to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Speaking of which, Philip Barlow had the same idea. Neither of them wanted their children to be close with each other.</p></div>
