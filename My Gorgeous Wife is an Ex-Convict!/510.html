        <h1>Chapter 509</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was back then, and it was still the same now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So what if Jason treated Grace like a delicate treasure now? Grace might not be able to stay by Jason's side in the future. After all, there were things enough to destroy everything Grace knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was no stranger to banquets, having previously accompanied Sean to a few. It was just that she was a little different now than she was then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having spent more than three years in prison, she had not taken much care of her skin. Her skin was rougher than before, and her hands were full of calluses. Her hair was not as silky smooth as before either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as if to erase this layer of worry in her, a professional stylist and a makeup artist came to Reed Residence in the afternoon to give Grace a makeover for the banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lilac-colored evening gown looked elegant. The crystals and crushed diamonds on the gown made it more eye-catching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A dress like this was probably worth a lot of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The stylist only said to Grace, "This is the dress Mr. Reed has prepared for Miss Cummins. Mr. Reed said it&rsquo;s your size."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but blush at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew her size perfectly well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace changed into the gown, she was impressed with Jason's ability to choose the gown and its size. It was not too tight or loose on her body, and the color complemented her skin tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she had not put on any makeup, her whole complexion seemed enhanced by her just wearing the gown. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the stylist styled Grace's hair. With the stylist's skillful hands, her hair was braided into a half-up hairstyle. The hair on her sides was braided and pinned up while the rest of her hair was let down and styled into wavy curls, making her look ladylike and also a little lively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the makeup artist was done, Grace stared at herself in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The makeup artist did not put on too much makeup on her. The makeup was pretty light and was focused on her eyes and lips, accentuating her features. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It made her feel like she was back in her prime days. This was how she had looked before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, she was more beautiful now than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You look so beautiful..." A mutter rang in Grace's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly came back to her senses and saw Jason in the mirror. No one knew when he had come up behind her. His hand was now lightly pressed against her shoulders, and his bright eyes were looking at her reflection in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was when Grace found out that the makeup artist and stylist were no longer in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where did they go?" she asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked them to leave," said Jason, slowly leaning down as his face inched closer to hers. "Do you like the gown? I thought it&rsquo;d suit you as soon as I saw it."</p></div>
