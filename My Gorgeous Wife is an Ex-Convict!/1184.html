        <h1>Chapter 1183</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the same as last time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost in anger, Stella left the room while Grace sat down by the bed with an apple and a paring knife. She began to peel an apple for Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you run into your former colleague downstairs?" Brian asked casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, you've seen him before. It's Chase Harper. You met him when I had that incident at the film studio," said Grace. She answered Brian casually without being defensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Chase Harper...' Brian's eyes glimmered. He still remembered that she had gone missing that time. Chase Harper's face had looked so anxious. That kind of care and concern... He could see that Chase Harper was probably interested in her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, he was worried about you," Brian said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's a nice man." A faint smile appeared on the corners of Grace's lips. She remembered that Chase Harper came to the hospital today to bring those Transformers toys to Nelson. She did not expect Chase Harper to keep such vintage toys so well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although new versions of Transformers toys were released all the time, Chase Harper's vintage Transformers were not necessarily available even if you had the money. Nelson must be delighted to see them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was so considerate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nice man?" Brian raised his eyebrows a little. A sour feeling slowly spread in his heart. 'Is she smiling because of Chase Harper?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yeah, he's nice. He's honest, kind, and doesn't judge people. It's nice to be friends with someone like him. People like him are rare these days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could say that she admired Chase Harper's qualities. Even though she did not love this man, she still wished him a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone at the Sanitation Service Center judged her when they found out that she had been to prison, but Chase Harper did not mind her sitting down with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many ordinary people were able to do that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only through those setbacks and being treated differently that such kindness became more valuable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace handed the peeled apple to Brian. He took it but did not eat it right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why aren't you eating?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was thinking about how seldom I hear you say people are nice. It seems that Chase Harper is pretty good," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "He's pretty good. It's a pity..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's a pity?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing." She shook her head and lowered her eyes gently. 'It's a pity Chase Harper seems to have misplaced his feelings on me, but... maybe Chase Harper has let it go.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got up to put the fruit knife back on the table. As she got up, the Bumblebee she was carrying in her pocket fell out and landed on Brian's hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She reached for it, but Brian grabbed it first. "This is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Transformer toy from a long time ago. Chase Harper gave me one as a souvenir when I met him today," she said, taking the Bumblebee from his hand and resting her eyes gently on it.</p></div>
