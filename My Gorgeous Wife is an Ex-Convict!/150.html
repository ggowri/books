        <h1>Chapter 149</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were still perplexed by the material evidence and the unanimous testimony provided by the witnesses to this very day.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How dare those people treat you that way! They only criticize others from a moral high ground without knowing anything at all," Lina said indignantly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace calmly replied, "It means nothing to me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina recalled all the pain in her friend's body and could not help sighing. "When I first welcomed Grace after she had left prison, I noticed all the wounds on her. There were both fresh and old ones. Although Grace has never told me about what she endured in prison, I can probably guess.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm afraid Grace went through all sorts of hardships in prison."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is Jay really Jason?" Lina asked, changing the topic of conversation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes." Grace nodded.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But... if he's Jason, why would he pretend to be a homeless person and stay with you in the rental apartment for so long?" she asked. "I can't seem to figure out this point. Does Jason have some peculiar interests?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's nothing but a game to him," Grace replied rather bitterly. "When I heard him say that with my own ears, I felt as if I was suffocating.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jason, who treated me so well, warmed my hands, waited by the door for me, and quietly listened to my woes, was nothing more than an illusion he created for a game. How absurd, and yet, how real!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"A game?" Lina was perplexed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes. Those rich people are probably bored by their lives and wanted to play a game to kill time," Grace replied softly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina was momentarily unsure of how to comfort her friend. "I know that my friend hates and fears deception the most.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jason undoubtedly dealt Grace a heavy blow."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace raised her head and gave Lina a faint smile. "I'm fine, don't worry. Besides, I don't have a relationship with him anymore. His game is probably over. Anyway, I didn't lose much. I've just returned to living by myself."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But her smile gave Lina an urge to cry. "Then I'll move in and live with you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You don't have to, Lina. I don't want you to fight with your family members over me again," Grace said. "I know you're nice to me but I'm sure you wouldn't want me to feel guilt over you whenever we spend time together. I already owe you enough..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't say anything about owing. We're best friends! When someone lost money in class, you were the only one who believed me and helped me to catch the thief. Grace, you believed me then and helped me. Now, I believe you and I'll help you too!" Lina exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ever since that incident all those years ago, I've known that Grace will be my best friend for life!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thank you," Grace muttered. "When I helped Lina all those years ago, I was barely lifting a finger, but now, Lina has sacrificed so much to help me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's right, what are your plans for the future?" Lina asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What else can I do? I'll go back to work at the Sanitation Service Center after the holidays," Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But the news of you being surrounded at the hospital entrance has already been uploaded to the internet. By now the Sanitation Service Center must know all about the incident from three years ago. How will your colleagues treat you...?" Lina said worriedly.</p></div>
