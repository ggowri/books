        <h1>Chapter 3344</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, it should get better in a few days," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina and Valda finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, I came to see the baby today and his eyes are finally open. His eyes really look like Brian's," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The baby's pair of phoenix eyes are exceptionally beautiful, with big eyes that when grown up, could easily captivate a lot of men with just this pair of eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yep," said Valda. When she saw her daughter open her eyes, and they looked like Brian's eyes, she was actually quite happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's beautiful eyes are such a shame if they didn't pass down to his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, compared to her happiness, Brian doesn't seem as happy. Instead, he looks regretful and says, "If only my eyes were like yours, then I would be a complete copy of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She completely ignored his regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few children are gathered around the baby at the moment, all looking at the little one. Mason, on the other hand, seems to be the least interested in the baby among the group of children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just glanced and then looked away, seeming to look at Veronica standing next to him. Throughout, he held Veronica's hand and never let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica seemed to be used to Mason's gaze, and quietly reminded him, "The baby is very cute. You should take a closer look. We came here today just to see the baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I just looked at it a moment ago," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That... could you take another look?" Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason reluctantly took a few more glances at the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina, who was nearby, saw the situation and said to Grace, "Why do I feel like your Mason is becoming more and more attached to Veronica?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I used to think that it was because the child was young, and maybe as they grew up, things would slowly change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Mason is 10 years old and Veronica is 12 years old, yet Mason's attachment has not decreased but rather increased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's the situation," Grace said, with a hint of worry in her eyes. As Mason grows older, his attachment to Veronica has become somewhat unhealthy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My second son is very intelligent and I don't have to worry about his studies at all. However, he is extremely socially inept and only wants to communicate with Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although in recent years, I have been willing to gradually communicate with my family, most of this communication is silent and limited to simple questions and answers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And anything related to Veronica, Mason cares about it. There was even a time when Mason got into a fight with a classmate and injured the other child, causing them to be hospitalized. Veronica then said a sentence, hoping that Mason wouldn't fight easily in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, some older kids got into a fight with Mason and started hitting him, but he didn't fight back at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the other party is just a child, so there haven't been any serious consequences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was during that time that Grace truly realized the influence Veronica had on her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she currently doesn't have a good way to change this, which is also causing her concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more Mason behaves this way, the more it means that the two children are tied together. If they were to untie, Mason might react strongly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... if the two children have to be tied together all the time, it's just not fair to Veronica.</p></div>
