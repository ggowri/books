        <h1>Chapter 3759</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because to her, he was no longer a little brother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of surprise flashed in his eyes, as if he didn't expect her to say that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And also..." She paused, reached out and held his face, "You said you wanted to truly </span><span>be in a relationship with me, I'm actually very happy, really."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, she took the initiative to tiptoe and kissed his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that her greatest hope was to become a family with him, not as siblings, but in a more intimate relationship, to become a family and then...be together forever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyelashes trembled slightly, his half-closed eyes looking at the face so close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he happy? Is he really happy to be in a relationship with her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then what is this wave of emotions in his heart? Is he also happy like her when he heard her say this and kissed him like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her kiss seemed to be slowly smoothing out the pain he had forgotten from the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even, he couldn't help but wonder, if he hadn't chosen to have his memories hypnotized back then, would the time they spent apart have been much shorter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, could they have been like this a few years earlier?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to have feelings for her... If he hasn't forgotten, how would he feel hearing her say this now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he suddenly had this curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley never expected to have dinner with the rumored Mason from the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Shirley had already seen Mason at school that day, sitting face to face with him made her see him more clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, this is my good friend from college, Shirley." Veronica made a simple introduction. "Shirley, he is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, Mason Reed, your boyfriend!" Shirley smiled and said. She only said this because she wanted to have dinner with Mason. She and Veronica had agreed that if they both had boyfriends, they would bring them along for a meal to "evaluate" them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't really expect to actually have dinner with Mason, but it became a reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, I'm Shirley." Shirley said to Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello." Mason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really dating Veronica? I heard you've been together since childhood, but then you didn't contact each other for several years?" Shirley asked. After all, she had known Veronica for three years, but before that, Veronica had never mentioned Mason's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason stared at Shirley with a slightly darkened face and didn't seem to have any intention of answering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was awkward and suffocating for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was about to intervene, but Shirley had already spoken first, "Are you and Veronica serious about your relationship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason squinted his eyes, and Shirley suddenly felt a chill run through her body. However, she still widened her eyes, waiting for his answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that her friend would get hurt. Although Veronica seemed very strong, Shirley had seen her friend secretly cry before. Sometimes, the stronger a person appears, the more fragile they are when they encounter something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica lightly nudged Mason's elbow, afraid that he would scare her friend. She said, "Shirley, let's change the topic. What do you want to eat..."</span></p></div>
