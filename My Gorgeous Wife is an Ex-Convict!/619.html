        <h1>Chapter 618</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Children... In particular, families like his paid more attention to their lineage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what? When we first started dating, I already told you it&rsquo;s all right even if I&rsquo;ll never have children of my own. I love you, not the children.&rdquo; She was the only thing in the world that mattered to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However..." She was still in two minds about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Does this really not matter? How many men in this world can accept having no children for the rest of their life?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace! Children are only the future heirs to the Reed family to me. I&rsquo;m not a man of love. If you and I have children in the future, then I might love them. If we don&rsquo;t, then we can adopt one at the orphanage or from one of the Reed family&rsquo;s collateral relatives. It doesn't seem like a problem to me. All I care about is whether you&rsquo;ll marry me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the end of his sentence, his eyes stared at her with a burning intensity. She felt as if she had been caught in a net by him. She could not get away nor escape from him, and more than that... She would not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, she loved him too much to break loose or run away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I will." The two words spat out of her mouth just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A smile came over his face. Then, he took her hand and kissed her fingertips. "I'll never let you go for the rest of my life..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only felt waves of warmth pouring into her heart from her fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a wonderful thing to be loved by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... Never let go of me, Jay." As she said so, she bent down, took his face in her hands, and kissed him once more on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the kiss of their vows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were going to grow old together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? You and Jason are getting married?" Lina did not expect to hear such sensational news on a date with her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace had a sweet smile on her lips as she said to her, "You know I don't have many friends, so I'd like to ask you to be my maid of honor. I wonder if you'd like to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'd love to be your maid of honor, but..." Lina looked at Grace, hesitating to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Lina thought Jason was a scary man when she learned that he was probably the culprit behind Evelyn&rsquo;s scandal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her best friend had nothing on Jason in terms of scheming, artifice, and ruthlessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it a good idea for Grace to marry Jason? Once some bumps in their marriage annoyed Jason, how would Grace protect herself then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could she only depend on Jason's love for her? How deep was Jason's love?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That fellow Hadwin said Jason was the inferior one and the one being dominated in their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina could not help but worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Just say what you have to say," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hesitated a little. "Do you love Jason enough to marry him, Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect to get married so soon either," Grace said with a chuckle, "However, it seems quite natural. I love him, and he loves me. Since he's willing to accept all of me, for better or worse, then I think marrying him is the best choice for me."</p></div>
