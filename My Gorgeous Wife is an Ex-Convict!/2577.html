        <h1>Chapter 2575</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said bitterly, "Louise Mitchell? If I had defended Amber Mitchell when she got into trouble, Louise Mitchell wouldn't have cut off her finger like that. I... I gave her that chance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you feel sorry for Amber Mitchell, you didn&rsquo;t have to do that. We can compensate her with more money. Since you're divorcing Louise Mitchell... you can marry her!" Old Madam Gregory said. The Gregory family already knew that their grandson's biological mother was Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Old Madam Gregory did not object to her son marrying Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory seemed to have heard a joke after hearing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, do you know how much I want to marry her? But it's impossible! She won't forgive me, let alone marry me. She won't look at me twice even if I give her my life," George Gregory said mournfully. The pain on his face looked as if he was already in hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Madam Gregory gave a sharp gasp and staggered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Gregory quickly grabbed his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you..." Old Madam Gregory tried to say something, but all the words seemed stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory got out of the hospital bed. He rushed straight out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Madam Gregory watched her son disappear while she was in a trance. She eventually fell into her husband's arms as she cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did this happen... Why..." Old Madam Gregory muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Gregory could only pat his wife on the shoulder and comfort her by saying, "Maybe things aren't as bad as we think. Don't overthink it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That being said, he had an intense feeling of unease. He kept having a premonition that maybe the Gregory family... would always be shrouded in gloom in the future...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory went all the way to the police station. The police finally released Amber Mitchell after he explained things to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry," said George Gregory. However, he froze again as soon as he spoke. He had been apologizing to her non-stop since some time ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Such a thing wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if you had stopped showing up in front of me,&rdquo; Amber Mitchell said indifferently as her eyes fell on George Gregory's right hand, which was bandaged and in a cast. "And don't ever say such silly things again. Even if you lose all your fingers, my cut finger will never recover. It's pointless for you to do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only felt another throb of pain in his heart. "Is there no way I can make it up to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't. There's no way we can start over," she said, taking her eyes off him. She walked toward the police station exit as if he were nothing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's uninjured left hand held his heart tightly. He felt a growing pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is there no way we can start over?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it impossible?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was like a prisoner sentenced to death. He had nothing left but despair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell commissioned a lawyer and filed a lawsuit to reclaim the shares that Louise Mitchell stole. Louise Mitchell became her guardian after claiming that she was mentally ill, so Louise Mitchell naturally took over her shares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that leading experts had cleared her of mental illness, she could get her shares back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, due to the restructuring of Mitchell Group&rsquo;s and Gregory Corporation's assets, it had become difficult to distinguish the shares. They needed to be re-calculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, the Gregory family did not make things difficult and offered a generous amount in court. Finally, the lawsuit could be said to have ended without any fuss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell did not go to court because she had given the lawyer full control of her case.</p></div>
