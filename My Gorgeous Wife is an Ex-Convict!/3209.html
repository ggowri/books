        <h1>Chapter 3207</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the wedding reception, Valda was taken back to the villa that had been set up as their new home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, a housewarming party was also held. After everyone had left, only Valda and Brian were left in the bedroom of their new house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must be tired," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Somewhat," Valda replied. During the busy and bustling wedding today, she didn't feel it much. But now that everything has suddenly quieted down, a sense of exhaustion has slowly crept up on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You go freshen up first, I'll help you put away your clean clothes," he said. As he spoke, he took out her clothes from the wardrobe and placed them in the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he came out of the bathroom, he saw her struggling to take off her wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll help you," said Brian, walking forward and pulling down the zipper on the back of Valda's wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding dress was removed, revealing the undergarments underneath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt a bit embarrassed and blushed, "Then I'll go in and take a shower first!" she said, about to walk towards the bathroom, but he suddenly picked her up horizontally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" She paused in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He held her tightly and walked into the bathroom with big steps. Then he carefully placed her on the ground next to the bathtub.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you wash up. I'll step out first. If you need anything, just call out to me," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, I see," said Valda, blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she had already lived with him for a period of time and they had been intimate more than once, at this moment, she couldn't help but blush and feel her heart race.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had already prepared the hot water for her. When he left the bathroom, Valda undressed and soaked her body in the warm water. She felt the exhaustion in her body slowly dissipating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From now on, she is Brian's wife! They will live together from now on! In the future, they will have their own children!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What will their children look like?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she was filled with anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the hot bath was ready, Valda put on her bathrobe and blushed as she walked out of the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was sitting on the couch, flipping through a book.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you reading?" she curiously asked as she approached him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The places we're going for our honeymoon. My company has a week off, so we can leave tomorrow. If you want to rest at home for a day, we can leave the day after tomorrow," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's leave tomorrow," Valda said. The destination for their honeymoon had been decided between them earlier. They chose a foreign country because they were afraid of being recognized while traveling domestically after the wedding, which would be inconvenient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Brian said. "I'll go take a shower first. You can look at the tourist attractions in the travel guide and decide where we'll go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda replied. After Brian went into the bathroom, she looked through the book next to her. TMason Swansonty they were going to for their foreign honeymoon was full of a cartoonish atmosphere, which was a place she had always wanted to visit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, being able to go there with him was really great!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for which attractions to visit, she had already made up her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda picked up the booklet and sat on the bed, looking at the bright red sheets and pillows... The feeling of being married hit her once again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was really married!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today was her wedding day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she lightly stroked the soft sheets, her blood rushed to her face again, making it even hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh my god! Valda, why are you blushing? She scolded herself in her mind, it's not like it's the first time!</p></div>
