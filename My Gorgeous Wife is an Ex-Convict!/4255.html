        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled. "You want to fall in love with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, otherwise why would I always want to be with you?" Tina said, "I've lost my previous memories and don't remember what happened before. Everyone tells me how much we loved each other and how much you loved me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her hand and gently touched his cheek. "I don't know how much I loved you before, but I can feel how much you loved me. </span><span>So</span><span> I also want to love you, even if I can't remember the past, I want to fall in love with you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her expression became more and more determined. "I want to love you, not because others keep telling me that we used to be in love, but because I want to love you on my own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler stared at </span><span>Tina,</span><span> his mind almost blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never expected to hear such words from her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it just because she wanted to love on her own?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, did you understand what I said?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you won't be afraid anymore," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina smiled, cupped Chandler's face, stood on her tiptoes, and kissed his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, she wanted to kiss him now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was startled, but he didn't push Tina away. Instead, he responded to her kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kiss reminded him of the past when Tina used to kiss him like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After who knows how long, the kiss finally ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler gazed at the person in front of him. "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't blame me for kissing you just now, right?" Tina asked with wide eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you suddenly kiss me?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just suddenly wanted to kiss you, so I did. If you find it unpleasant, then I won't do it again in the future," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with deep affection. "I really like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He liked her initiative and her honesty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked and breathed a sigh of relief. "Also, tonight I don't want to sleep in the guest room. I want to share a room with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were already husband and wife anyway, so it shouldn't be a problem to sleep in the same room at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to resist the feelings she had for Chandler in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wasn't clear whether it was love or not, she enjoyed being close to him, holding him, and kissing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler hesitated when he heard this, his face showing a hesitant expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Can't I share a room with you?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that you can't share a room with me, it's just..." he hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just what?" she widened her eyes, waiting for him to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was afraid that his symptoms would suddenly flare up. These past few days, the cursed pain would intermittently occur, and he wasn't sure when it would happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his pain suddenly flares up when he's with her, can he really restrain his impulse toward her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when pain strikes, the reason is fragile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she, she is the one he desires the most, the one who drives him crazy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though we are already married, you haven't fallen in love with me yet. If we share a room, I'm afraid I'll act on impulse and end up hurting you!" Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pondered for a moment, "So, if I fall in love with you, then we can sleep in the same room?"</span></p></div>
