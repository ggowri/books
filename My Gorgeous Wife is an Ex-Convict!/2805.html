        <h1>Chapter 2803</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want to raise any money for you. Cousin, the house is your business. I have no obligation to raise money for you. Buy a house if you can afford it. If not, you should discuss with your girlfriend about renting a house," Valda Theller said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You get to live a lavish life with Young Master Hart, but you&rsquo;re asking your cousin and his wife to rent a place?" Rowena Santiago asked, her voice rising suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, don't do that. You'll freak Valda out," Wynne hurriedly said. Then, he said to Brian with a guilty expression, "Young Master Hart, don't mind her. My mother just didn't expect Valda to say that... She lost her temper for a moment. After all, we've always thought that we should find ways to deal with difficulties together when a family member is in trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, a family?" Brian raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne said, "Yeah, Valda would&rsquo;ve ended up in an orphanage if my family hadn't adopted her. I thought I would rent a house with my girlfriend if I had no choice. But... didn't Valda become your girlfriend, Young Master Hart? I'm worried that people will accuse Valda of being heartless and preoccupied with her own luxurious life if they find out I&rsquo;m renting a place. So I thought I should buy a house instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After that, Wynne said with a &lsquo;sincere&rsquo; look, "If Valda doesn't want to borrow me money, then... Why don't you lend me some, Young Master Hart? I can write an IOU and pay you back in the future. I don't want the outside world to get the wrong idea about Valda."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke so earnestly as if it came from familial love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Wynne's opinion, Brian was bound to give them money or a house after he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With Brian's wealth, he probably would not ask him to pay back the millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Wynne with a half-smile. "In that case, how thoughtful of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, no, I'm Valda's cousin. I have to be considerate of Valda, of course," said Wynne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? What do you want me to do?" Brian turned to look at Valda Theller and let Valda Theller decide. It was as if he would follow her wishes no matter her decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you don't need to lend them money because of me," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, don't go too far!" Wynne panicked. He thought he had persuaded Brian, but his cousin sabotaged it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll only tell you the same thing. I won't lend you any money," said Valda Theller as she looked at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You stupid girl. Do you think you're all that just because you've gotten a wealthy boyfriend?" Rowena Santiago habitually slapped Valda Theller's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she used to slap Valda Theller whenever she found her annoying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had become a habit for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she forgot that Brian was still there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stopped Rowena Santiago's hand in mid-air. Brian, who had looked nonchalant, now had indifference on his face. "No one can hit her in front of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian waved his hand when he finished speaking, and Rowena Santiago staggered and fell to the floor. Her hand that had been about to hit Valda Theller hurt terribly.</p></div>
