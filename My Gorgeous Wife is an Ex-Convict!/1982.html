        <h1>Chapter 1980</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you think?" he asked nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well... We met on a blind date, but we're just friends. Even though... we did go on dates with marriage as the end goal, we didn't do anything intimate..." Her voice grew quieter under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Come on. Why do I feel guilty?' Lina thought to herself as she bit her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was single then, so there was nothing wrong with going on a blind date!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, she and Anthony Sherman had never done anything that crossed the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is that so? Does that mean you have never even held hands with him?" Hadwin Stephenson's voice lazily rang out in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yep," she answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, he was breathing on her cheek, and that handsome face was magnified before her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin, what... What are you doing?" she asked in a stammer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He ran his fingers gently over her chin. "You&rsquo;ve never been this close either?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"... Yeah." Her face flushed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His lips were close to her ear while his warm breath sprayed on her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina only felt that her ears were getting hotter and hotter. She wanted to raise her hands to cover her hot ears, but he pulled her hands down first. "You didn't do this either?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As he finished speaking, his lips touched her ear. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's face instantly reddened, and she felt her blood surge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Come on! Does he know he's tempting me to do things I shouldn&rsquo;t do in my current condition?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you do it?" His voice muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No... No way!" she stammered, trying to put some distance between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was pregnant. She could not get too &lsquo;excited&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He seemed to smile with satisfaction. His fingers grabbed her chin, forcing her to look at him. He used his other hand to wrap it around her waist and drew her closer to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, since you're pregnant with my child and want to pester me forever, you're forbidden from being intimate with other men, got it?" He stared at her with a straight face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well... Can I at least shake hands and hug my idols?" She thought it over and bargained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He frowned slightly. She... seemed to have a lot of idols, and she would have new ones almost every year. He could figure out just from the photos of her idols on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There were probably dozens of them. If she shook hands and hugged each of them...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's scalp tingled just from his imagination alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Of course, I promise there&rsquo;ll be nothing more than handshakes and hugs," added Lina.</p></div>
