        <h1>Chapter 1368</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only hoped he could treat Nelson kindly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After taking a few pictures, the little one said, "Mommy, come take pictures with Daddy and me too! Can we, Daddy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one looked up at Martin Weiss expectantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was about to say yes, but Kyla Corbyn spoke first, "Our photos will be taken automatically when we&rsquo;re on the rides in this amusement park. I'll take those photos out for you when we get home, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one immediately nodded excitedly and did not bring up the topic again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn breathed a sigh of relief. She just discovered that the amusement park had such a function, and it saved her from having to force herself to take pictures with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it was her son's wish, it was a torment to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression sank. &lsquo;Does this woman not want to take pictures with me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I should be the one to not want it. How dare this woman...' However, Kyla Corbyn did not even glance at him. She just talked to her son with her head down. The adult and the child kept pointing at the landscape outside through the Ferris wheel's glass window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly had the feeling that she was treating him like air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At noon, the three found a restaurant in the amusement park and sat down. Kyla Corbyn stopped eating after just having a little of the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you stop eating?" he asked when he saw that she had stopped eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm full," she said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His brows could not help furrowing. 'She hardly ate a few mouthfuls and she's already full?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one requested to go to the restaurant's playground after finishing lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn nodded, and the little one immediately ran toward the playground excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the restaurant's playground area was not far from where they were sitting, Kyla Corbyn did not follow him. Instead, she sat in her seat and watched her son who had gone over to play with other children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, children had to learn to be independent. She could not be there for him forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not even have much time left to accompany him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn asked the waiter for a glass of water and took out the pill organizer from her bag. There were eight pills in the organizer, each of a different shape and color. She began to take them one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned even more at this sight. "Why do you need to take so many medications? What's wrong with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn swallowed the pills with the water. "I don't need to tell you what's wrong with me, do I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face darkened, and he suddenly grabbed her hand that was holding the pills. He asked sternly, "What's wrong with you? Why are you taking so many pills?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A bad feeling suddenly surged in his heart, and the way she had turned pale in pain the few times before recurred to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not have to take so many medications at once if it was just an ordinary illness!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, what is this? Are you concerned about me? Aren't you supposed to hate me to the death? Why do you care what's wrong with me?" she sneered and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened. "Don't flatter yourself. I just don't want you to die in front of me and irritate my eyes. If you're going to die one day, die somewhere I can't see you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he violently shook her hand away as if it was filthy.</p></div>
