        <h1>Chapter 2049</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, I thought I've made it clear. I thought we agreed not to disturb each other from now on? What are you doing now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What am I doing?" Martin Weiss laughed bitterly at himself. "I love you too much and can't get over you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I don't love you anymore. I got over you a long time ago!" said Kyla as she struggled to push him away, but he still kept a grip on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So are you going to be with Chase Harper?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She glared at him. "Who I'm going to be with is none of your business!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes instantly narrowed, and the look on his face turned cold. "What's so good about a man like Chase Harper? What can he give you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's so bad about a man like him? At least he won't hurt me and send me to prison!" she blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His face instantly paled, and his grip on her loosened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla took the opportunity to shove Martin Weiss away and hurried out of the car. Just as she was about to make a quick getaway, Martin Weiss's voice rang out behind her. "Kyla, you can't be with Chase Harper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She instantly paused and turned around, only to see him standing beside the car in silence. He exuded a sense of danger and loneliness. He spoke indifferently as if he were merely stating a fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She bit her lip. "Martin Weiss, it's up to me who I can be with, not you! You're not some high and mighty god, and I'm not a lowly pest that's at your mercy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, she left without looking back, leaving Martin Weiss standing alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a long while, Martin Weiss slowly raised his hand and caressed the cheek Kyla had just slapped. His cheek was still tingling, but he enjoyed it because she was the one who did it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Who's the high and mighty god? Who's the pest? I'm the one who's at her mercy!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Weiss, here's the information you asked for." They respectfully handed Martin Weiss a stack of information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss took the information and looked through them. Most of the information was the investigation results on Chase Harper, including Chase Harper's career, marriage, and children in recent years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If Chase Harper saw it, he would be surprised at the details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Martin Weiss saw that Chase Harper and his ex-wife were divorced, and it was because she cheated on him, Martin Weiss's eyes darkened as if thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The information at the back was from the playground that day, including surveillance footage of Kyla, Chase Harper, and the children in the amusement park. It was stored in a flash drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Martin Weiss saw the video of his son and the little girl Juliet surrounded by other children in the play area, he suddenly felt a pang in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He read the information and learned that the children called Nelson deaf because they saw the hearing aid in Nelson's ear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Deaf... Deaf! How ironic is it that they called my son that!</p></div>
