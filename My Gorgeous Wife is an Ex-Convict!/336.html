        <h1>Chapter 335</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, watching Kyla Corbyn's beaming face, Grace sighed to herself and put the order on the electric bike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With more orders, Kyla could make more money and get Nelson a cochlear implant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she thought of Nelson, Grace could not help but feel a pang in her heart. An adorable boy like him had such a defect. Plus, she had never seen Nelson's father after all this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was also a Corbyn, so she could guess something. Maybe Kyla was alone with the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In this case, of course, it was more difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Riding on the electric bike, Grace reached the entrance to the Reed Group building. Several security guards were already familiar with Grace. When they saw Grace coming, they enthusiastically put all the food onto the trolley and even helped push it into the building all the way to the elevator. They also kindly pressed the elevator button for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the receptionist, she greeted Grace with a smile and even bowed in respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was probably the only delivery girl to enjoy this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She, of course, knew that it was all because of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door of the elevator opened, and Grace got out with the trolley. Jason's secretaries surrounded her, consciously taking the food and politely bidding her hello.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outsiders might even think she was an executive in the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked toward Jason's office with two lunch boxes. She knocked twice at the door and opened it as usual when she heard him reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was dumbstruck the next moment because there were a lot of well-dressed people in the office. As she was walking into the building, she noticed pictures of these people on the bulletin boards&mdash;they were all executives of Reed Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Grace was staring at them with two lunchboxes in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There you are. Take a seat." Jason pointed to the sofa in the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked over to the sofa almost numbly, put down the lunchboxes, then... sat down and stared at the executives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can eat first. I'll come and eat when I'm done here," Jason said in a gentle tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless. How could she eat in front of so many people?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each of these executives felt complicated right now. There had been a rumor going around in the company that the president would take lunch with a delivery girl every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many of them did not believe it and found the rumor ridiculous. However, the rumor turned out to be true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman was wearing a mandarin jacket with the words &lsquo;Yan Yan Restaurant&rsquo; on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, these executives were curious about this Yan Yan Restaurant. Did the president... particularly enjoy the food at this restaurant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason's voice immediately caught their attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Redo the budget and keep on discussing the acquisition with the company. Get it done in three days, and..." Jason's voice was as cold as usual. It was a far cry from the gentle way he had been talking to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After that, Jason announced the end of the meeting. The group of executives filed out and Jason went over to Grace. "Aren't you usually in a hurry to eat? Why aren't you in a hurry today?"</p></div>
