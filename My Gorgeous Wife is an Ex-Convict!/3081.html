        <h1>Chapter 3079</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda walked over to the sofa in the living room and lovingly hugged her old pillow, then she touched her comic book.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you hungry? I'll have someone prepare dinner for you. We'll also have someone clean and set up the new bedroom. Your clothes and belongings from before are still here, and I'll have someone move them to the new room," he said, then instructed the servants to carry out his orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tenderness now seems to have an added layer of caution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But the more he acted this way, the heavier it weighed on her mind, and she... didn't want him to be so careful around her. It only made her more aware that she was different from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Brian's phone rang. He saw that it was Camille calling and answered the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I heard Camille's urgent voice coming from my phone, "Are you currently with Valda?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Right," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you let Valda take the call? I want to talk to her," Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced at Valda, who was still looking down, and handed her the phone. "It's Camille's call. She probably couldn't reach you, so she called my phone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda suddenly realized that her phone was still at Camille's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking the phone, she heard Camille's urgent voice on the other end. "Valda, I'm sorry I had to tell you about your return today. But if I didn't, I was afraid someone might get hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille briefly explained what happened at the restaurant and added, "You and Brian haven't seen each other for a year. You should talk and sort things out. You can talk about anything and everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I understand," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call ended, Valda handed the phone back to Brian and noticed the torn cloth wrapped around his right wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only then that she realized that the cloth was a remnant of her clothes that they found after she was washed away by the water. Brian had kept it wrapped around his wrist for a year, treasuring it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, he even got angry and lost his temper when the cloth was accidentally stained with a drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong?" Brian asked, following her gaze to the bandage wrapped around his wrist. Then he seemed to remember something and said, "Did Camille tell you about what happened in the restaurant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh-huh," Valda nodded. "Actually, it's just a piece of torn cloth, there's no need to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if it's just scraps of cloth, they were left by you. It took me a lot of effort to find them, and I don't want them to be dirtied by anyone," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda raised her hand with mixed feelings and slowly untied the piece of cloth wrapped around Brian's wrist under his gaze. "Don't wear it again in the future. I... have already come back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She doesn't want this piece of torn cloth to become something that holds him back. She hopes he can move on from the past and not lose control or go crazy because of something she did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared fixedly at Valda and murmured, "Yes, you've come back." Back to his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instinctively wanted to avoid starting a conversation and to avoid his gaze. She felt that if she kept staring at him, she would fall for him again and might not be able to say what she wanted to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But his fingers held onto her chin, forcing her face to be directly in front of him.</p></div>
