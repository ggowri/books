        <h1>Chapter 638</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Forgive me, Grace. Forgive me no matter what, all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could only beg when she was asleep because he did not dare to say it in her presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was done changing her clothes, he covered her with a thin quilt and was about to get up when her fingers grabbed his sleeve. Then, her eyes drifted open. "I forgive you, Jay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was shocked. His deep eyes looked at her in surprise. 'Did she know what she was saying?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The corners of her lips were raised as if she were smiling, and her eyes were red from the crying earlier. It formed a strange contrast. "I... Don't know why you'd ask me to forgive you, but I'll forgive you. I'll forgive you... Because... You're Jay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she finished talking, she wearily closed her eyes and fell asleep again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared blankly at her, then bent down and kissed her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm Jason, your Jay..." he murmured. 'Even if... You won't forgive me, I won't let you go!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she had become indispensable to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace woke up the next day with bursts of pain in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's what happens when you drink too much!' She could not help but close her eyes and rub her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have a bad headache?" A voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately opened her eyes and saw that he was in the room too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a little painful, but not much," said Grace. In other words, the pain was tolerable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked the servants to prepare hangover soup. They&rsquo;ll bring it over later. You can wash up first," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and was about to get out of bed when Jason picked her up in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" she screamed, "I&hellip; I can walk by myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You still have a headache. You might fall after a few steps," he said. Then, he took her into the bathroom, got the bath ready, and squeezed the toothpaste for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt like a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was drunk yesterday. Did I do anything strange?" She had drunk a little too much, so her memory was a blur. She vaguely remembered a woman interrupting them when she was drinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then&hellip; She seemed to have gotten into the car with him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no memory of what she said or what happened to the strange woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you wish you had done something strange?" Jason asked without answering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was rendered speechless. 'All right, forget it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace picked up her toothbrush and cup before starting to brush her teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly said, "You lifted my chin and kissed me in the bar last night to warn other women not to have any funny ideas about me, remember?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ahem!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nearly swallowed all the toothpaste in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was&hellip; Was I that bold?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Rinse your mouth before you swallow the toothpaste." He kindly warned.</p></div>
