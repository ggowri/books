        <h1>Chapter 1870</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At first, she was driven to a corner by her family's debt and almost sold herself in a nightclub. However, someone suddenly approached her and told her she could make a fortune if she gave birth to a child through in vitro fertilization to an important man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Not only would it pay off her family's debt but it would also be enough for her to live a wealthy life. It was so much better than making a living in a nightclub.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was intrigued and began to contact the middleman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She thought the man who wanted her to carry his baby must have some flaws, but the man who appeared before her was a tall, handsome man. Besides, she also secretly found out online that the man was the crown prince of the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed like a dream that the crown prince wanted to have a baby with her, so she agreed to be his surrogate. She had specially dressed herself up today just so she could climb up the social ladder. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she wanted was not just to be a surrogate but to be able to take this opportunity to get to the top.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, to her disappointment, Brian just looked at her indifferently. It was as if he had seen through her conspiracy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll repeat myself. I only need a child, and it doesn't matter who the mother is because I won't have anything to do with her. The baby will solely be born through IVF, and you won't have anything to do with them," Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The woman's eyes glimmered. He spoke as if he was just using her as a living tool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I just supposed to be a surrogate like what the contract says? I can't accept it! I finally have a chance to turn my life around and change my fate. Why would I be willing to settle for that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking down, the woman carefully hid her thoughts. "I... I see, Mr. Hart. I won't have any funny ideas anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then you can leave. Tell the secretary if there's anything else you need. I'll send someone to take you to the firm tomorrow," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once the woman left the office, he raised his hand and rubbed his brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The Hart family needed an heir, after all. He... had no plans to marry any woman other than Grace. Therefore, this was the most direct way to get a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He recalled how his mother had looked at him like he was a lunatic when he told her his decision. "You're never going to marry? Are you going to save yourself for Grace for the rest of your life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I can't marry someone I don't love," he answered his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Love? Many marriages are without love! What's more, you can take your time to develop feelings for each other," his mother said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He chuckled. "If I had never met Grace, I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded marrying a woman I didn't love if she was worthy of the Hart family, provided I didn't hate her. But Mom, I&rsquo;ve met Grace, and I know what it's like to love someone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How was he going to spend the rest of his life with a woman he did not love?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His mother did not go on after hearing what he said. She only covered her face and burst into tears. He could not say anything to comfort her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After losing Grace, he had no intention of ever getting married. However, the Hart family needed an heir, so this might be the best way to get a child who would carry the Hart family's bloodline.</p></div>
