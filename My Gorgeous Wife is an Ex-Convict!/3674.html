        <h1>Chapter 3672</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Casually engaging in physical contact with others?" he sneered. "Only those who haven't been manipulated can easily say such things. Have you ever been forced to the ground, forced to do things you didn't want to do, or even forced to jump into the abyss even though you knew it was a bottomless pit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?" She looked puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mockery on his face grew stronger. "Of course you haven't. You have no idea how dirty this world can be. No matter how much you struggle, scream, or beg for mercy, it's useless. Others even take pleasure in seeing your pain. The more you struggle, the more you please them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his face gradually turned pale, his eyes becoming somewhat confused, and his expression twisted with pain, as if he were trapped in a bad memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stared at him in astonishment. "Law...Ro, Roger, what's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know anything, Jasper. You don't know anything at all!" He gasped, speaking as if accusing her, and his body staggered, as if he were about to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper reached out to try to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before her hand could touch him, he had already waved it away. "Don't touch me. Don't you think I'm dirty? Then don't touch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I said something wrong just now, I apologize! But your current situation doesn't look good. Let me take you to the school infirmary," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need!" He took a deep breath and suddenly stepped forward, snatching the invitation letter from her hand. "Since you came to see me today to deliver the invitation, I have received it. You don't have to pretend to care about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he turned around and left unsteadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper watched Roger's back and couldn't help but furrow her brows. When he said those words just now, the painful expression on his face didn't seem fake. What happened to him? She thought that being adopted by the wealthy Elliott family and being treated as their heir should have made his life comfortable. But why did he have such a painful expression?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened to him in these years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people wanted to attend the Reed family's little princess's birthday party, but this time, the Reed family didn't plan to make it big. They only invited some relatives and friends for a noon celebration at their mansion since it was on a Sunday. Jasmine planned to go to a concert that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyla, Lina, Amber, and Valda came early in the morning, and the children followed suit. As usual, the women gathered together, the children played together, and the men had to gather together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, a group of business tycoons gathered in a corner of the Reed family's living room, drinking red wine and sighing about the passage of time.</span></p></div>
