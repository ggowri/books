        <h1>Chapter 3481</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afterwards, the police investigated various cars that left the nightclub during that time period and finally identified one of them. However, it turned out that the car was stolen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The real car owner reported the case to the police on this side a week ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, a strange phone number sent a ransom message demanding that the Reed and Barlow families prepare $1 billion to redeem the hostage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One billion, the Barlow family naturally cannot come up with it, so they can only rely on the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason was very straightforward and said that money was not a problem as long as the hostages were safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And these individuals are clearly not novices, as they are demanding that one billion US dollars be transferred to foreign accounts, not just one account, but a total of one hundred accounts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to see if they are safe," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, the kidnappers sent a video showing Jasper and Veronica bound and blindfolded, but unharmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was scared but remained calm and did not cry. Veronica, on the other hand, was unusually quiet. If it weren't for her breathing and the fact that she was sitting up, one might think she was dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace and Jason both wondered if she was too scared to make a sound after seeing the video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The kidnappers had a TV on in the background, showing a current program to indicate that the two were still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The kidnapping was being kept quiet by the Reed family and the police, so outsiders only thought something had happened at a nightclub and were unaware of the kidnapping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't let the kids know about this, especially Mason," Grace said, concerned about how their second son would react to the news about Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We can keep it from them for as long as possible," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when the couple returned to the Reed House, Mason was not there. According to the maid, he had left in a hurry after receiving a phone call in the afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both Jason and Grace felt uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the afternoon, is it possible? Could it be that coincidental?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, in a deserted wilderness, Mason was lying motionless in the nearby bushes, with his deep black eyes fixed on the abandoned warehouse not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This afternoon, he received a call from Veronica. However, when he answered the phone, there was no one speaking on the other end and the call was hung up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He feels uneasy in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Signal tracking was immediately carried out. Even Veronica herself didn't know that a miniature signal tracker had been placed in the pendant of the necklace that was once given to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This necklace is something she often wears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I was originally worried that her relationship with Daniel would make it difficult for him to find her, so I did what I did. But I never expected it to come in handy like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because... today she was wearing that necklace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he immediately instructed the driver to head towards the location of the signal, because according to the map, it was a place she would never normally go to. He felt both curious and slightly uneasy.</p></div>
