        <h1>Chapter 2971</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Mr. and Mrs. Hart left, Brian hugged Valda from behind and said, "See, there's no need to be nervous around my parents. They won't bite."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do they really... not have any issues with me?" Valda asked hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think of me?" he asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...both my parents are deceased, and I don't have much of a family background. My profession is just a small cartoonist," she said, biting her lip slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled faintly, "I've been searching for so many years to find someone like you. Unless they don't want grandchildren, why would they object?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he didn't say was that for a while, his mother just wanted a girl, and didn't ask for anything else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My parents have already accepted you. If they didn't, they wouldn't have invited you to dinner tomorrow," he added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words seemed to remind her of something, and she hurriedly said, "What should I wear to meet your parents tomorrow? It's a formal dinner, and I need to make a good impression!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just be yourself," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he said that, the next day, Valda still chose a light blue suit that Brian had bought for her before. It looked more formal, but not too serious, and made her look gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She also put on light makeup to make herself look more energetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But after following Brian to the restaurant for dinner, she said, "Um...I need to go to the bathroom and touch up my makeup."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll wait for you here," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda replied and quickly walked into the restroom. She looked at her makeup in the mirror and then took out some powder to touch up her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hopes to meet Brian's parents today in a good state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a voice suddenly sounded beside me, "I saw Brian just now in the lobby of the restaurant. I heard from the manager here that the Hart family booked a private room today. Chairman Hart and Mrs. Hart personally selected the dishes, saying that they were going to meet the prince's girlfriend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? The prince has a girlfriend?" Another person chimed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Exactly, I don't even know what kind of person she is, but she's so lucky to become the girlfriend of the crown prince."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Could it be some female celebrity?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, did you also pursue the prince back then, but he didn't even notice you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmph!" A cold snort came from the woman's nose. "Maybe we'll get to meet the prince's girlfriend today. I can't wait to see what kind of woman can be the prince's girlfriend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda, who was standing on the side, felt extremely awkward listening to the conversation between these two women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The girlfriend of the Crown Prince," as they call her, is right beside them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked through the mirror and saw the woman who had once pursued Brian. She was wearing a well-made floral dress, had a slender figure, and was wearing bright makeup. She did look quite attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked through the mirror and quickly made eye contact with the woman. The woman's face darkened and she turned to glare at Valda, saying "What are you looking at?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't...I didn't see anything," Valda stammered, quickly lowering her head and continuing to touch up her makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman looked at Valda's clothes and then at the powder she was using. Suddenly, she sneered, "Do you really think wearing designer clothes can make you look rich? At least change the powder you're using. This cheap powder is obviously something only poor people would use. It's embarrassing to even take it out."</p></div>
