        <h1>Chapter 331</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She went on with the rest of the deliveries, and by the time she had lunch at two o'clock, Grace did not eat much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "What's the matter? You've eaten so little. Don't you like today's dishes?" When it was lunchtime at noon, everyone in the small restaurant would take advantage of their free time and get the chef to cook several dishes for them to eat together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I think I ate too much before coming to work this morning." Grace looked aside at Nelson. "Why aren&rsquo;t you eating? I'll feed Nelson some fruits. I'm full now anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took an apple and peeled it. Then, she cut the apple into small pieces and fed them to Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one obediently opened his mouth and nibbled at the apple, occasionally smiling at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After feeding him the fruit, the little one got sleepy. He yawned and spread his hands wide, gesturing Grace to hug him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace naturally took the little one in her arms and gently lulled him to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the little one could not hear her soft humming, his young tender fingers would gently brush against her lips as if trying to hear her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the little one finally fell asleep. Grace's nose felt a little sore as she looked at the sleeping little body. Why could an adorable child like him not hear? Sometimes, God was too cruel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only hoped that in the future, after Nelson got a cochlear implant, he would be able to hear all the voices in the world and not let this regret follow him for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take him back to his room." Mrs. Corbyn stepped forward and took her grandson from Grace's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Behind the small restaurant was a small, simple house where Kyla Corbyn lived with her mother and Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said to Grace, "You'll be a good mother in the future, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A good mother... Grace gave a faint smile, but her heart was filled with bitterness. She might never get the chance to become a mother. When she was in prison, she had once been kicked in the womb during a beating. The doctors said it would be difficult for her to conceive in the future, and even if she did, her womb would not be able to sustain the growth of the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By three o'clock in the afternoon, orders for food deliveries had come in again, but the address and the person who ordered it caused Grace to frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was her old law firm again, except this time it was Andrea who ordered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of her last chance meeting with Andrea, Andrea's words were full of ridicule about her current difficult state. This food delivery order was probably not a coincidence but intentional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had experienced all the awkward and embarrassing things already. This was nothing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the order Kyla Corbyn had prepared and got on the electric bike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she arrived at the law firm, the receptionist saw Grace and said to her, "Hold on a minute, Grace. Andrea asked me to call her as soon as you're here so that she can come and pick up her order."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, the receptionist made an internal call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A moment later, Andrea hurried out. Andrea was now dressed in formal clothes with delicate makeup and a proud smirk on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she saw Grace, Andrea said, &ldquo;You're delivering food, Grace! I didn't believe it when I heard it yesterday!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, Andrea left Grace's food delivery on the other side of the reception desk and took her hand warmly as if the two of them were close.</p></div>
