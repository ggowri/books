        <h1>Chapter 686</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're regarding me as an outsider if you say that. Grace, we said we'd be friends forever. You mustn't keep such things from me in the future. I don't want to learn about what happened to my friends from the news," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it." Grace found her nose a little sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was how Lina behaved. If she regarded someone as a friend, she would treat them wholeheartedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Lina met with Grace and learned the details of the case, including how Dexter Rios was the mastermind behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can't believe he&rsquo;d frame someone else just because he was afraid of being involved. However, now that you've proved your innocence, what are you going to do next?" Lina said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have no idea," said Grace. She had some expectations but also some hesitation for her future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to become a lawyer again?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chuckled bitterly. "I haven't been in the business for four years. I don't know if I can do it yet. I can't even remember some of the legal provisions I used to know very well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;d be a shame if you gave up on being a lawyer. Since you're not in a hurry for a job, you can familiarize yourself with the legal provisions and case studies first. Grace, I'm sure you can do it!" Lina said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had always admired her best friend's ability to learn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it before saying, "That's true. I should familiarize myself with them first. I'll have to give it a try."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was finally qualified to be a lawyer again, so of course she should cherish this chance more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Accompany me to the bookstore later. I want to buy the latest law books," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure!" Lina said happily. Her best friend was finally pulling herself together. Of course, she had to support her fully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two arrived at the bookstore, and Grace went to the law section to begin looking. Speaking of which, it seemed that she had not been here for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she went to prison, she was a regular. She came here almost once or twice a month, not only for books on her profession but also magazines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though online reading had become the norm, she still preferred the feeling of reading on paper and taking notes at random.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt emotional coming back here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was a bit bored hanging out at the law section. After all, it was not what she studied. As such, she said to Grace, "Grace, I'll go check out the magazines. You can come and find me when you're done choosing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Grace while nodding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina trotted over to the magazine section to browse through magazines about her favorite idols while Grace continued to pick out her books.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang out, "Are you... Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and looked up to see the face of an unfamiliar man. He was about 25 or 26 years old. He was dressed in casual clothes and looked quite ordinary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw her looking up, he immediately added, "You must be Grace. I've seen your photos online. Lily has apologized to you online. Why didn't you respond to her? Is it so hard to say that it doesn't matter? Moreover, Lily believed that you were her sister&rsquo;s murderer because of the court&rsquo;s misjudgment back then. In fact, she didn't have to apologize to you at all. She was just too nice..."</p></div>
