        <h1>Chapter 3076</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was shocked as he looked at Valda's right calf. He knew very well what her leg used to look like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, it has become like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's quite ugly, isn't it..." Valda said awkwardly, "Actually...there's nothing really nice about it. Sometimes, even I don't feel like looking at it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Am I ugly?" he hesitated, but the shape of her legs and the fierce scars on them told him of the pain she had endured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Originally, she didn't have to endure such pain at all! And all this pain is because of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, stop looking," Valda thought as she tried to cover her legs again with her long skirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Brian took a step ahead and held her hand, then lowered his head and kissed her slightly deformed calf and the gruesome scar on her leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry for causing you so much pain, I'm sorry..." He choked up, his voice already hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's body suddenly became extremely stiff, and she just stared straight ahead at the man in front of her. He closed his eyes and kissed her calf almost reverently, while she felt an intense heat where he had kissed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">My heart rate has become so fast that it feels like with every beat, my heart is about to jump out of my throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stop jumping! Don't jump so vigorously anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This will only make her more reluctant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I'm fine now, it's not a big deal. Besides, you didn't cause this injury, so you don't need to apologize to me," murmured Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian finally lifted his head and opened his eyes again, saying, "Now I'll take you to the hospital and find a specialist to examine your injury."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... no need, I've already seen a doctor for my injury!" murmured Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she lost her ID card, so she borrowed Lisa's relative's daughter's ID card to go to a big hospital for a check-up. However, the final result was extremely disappointing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And the person who examined her injury at that time was also an expert. The expert only expressed regret and said that her injury had been left untreated for too long, and some of the nerves had already lost their function. In addition, the bone fracture at that time was not properly treated, so now it's too late for everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Late, so from now on, she can only be a cripple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did the doctor say?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The doctor... just said that my leg is going to be like this..." She tried to downplay her pain with a casual tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned and asked, "What do you mean by 'that's it'?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In the future... let it be like this." She murmured, but then a smile appeared on her face. "But at least, I'm still alive now, and I can use one leg to exchange for my life. I think it's worth it. Before, I thought I was going to die for sure, so being alive is better than anything else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her smile, but his heart felt a sourness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, as long as she's alive, that's better than anything else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But why should she have to endure everything? Why can't these wounds fall on him instead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take you to the hospital!" said Brian, lifting Valda up horizontally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian! I...I don't want to go to the hospital," Valda hurriedly said. "I don't need to go to the hospital right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, please let me take you to the hospital and have the doctor check you again, okay?" Brian pleaded, "I don't know who the doctor was that treated you before, but I will find a doctor to examine you again. I won't let your leg be left like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda froze, unable to refuse as if the words were stuck in her throat and couldn't come out.</p></div>
