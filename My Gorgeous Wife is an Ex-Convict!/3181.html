        <h1>Chapter 3179</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Valda said she would stay overnight with Lisa in the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today is the first day my godmother came to Emerald City. She's not familiar with you yet, so if you stay here tonight, she might feel uncomfortable. You should go back to the villa alone tonight, and I'll stay here with my godmother," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Brian understood, his expression still fell a bit. After all, if Valda stayed here tonight, it meant he had to go back to the villa alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then...shall I come pick you up tomorrow morning to go to the studio?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need. I'm not going to the studio tomorrow. I'll spend the next few days with my godmother, shopping around Emerald City and buying things she needs. It's also a good opportunity to help her get familiar with the place," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In that case, I'll arrange a driver. If I have time, I'll join you guys for a walk," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Valda didn't go back to her own room. Instead, she slept with Lisa on one bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During that year, she also slept in Lisa's bed at Lisa's house, which was the only bed available.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lying together like this reminded Valda of those difficult days. For her, those days were only a memory from two months of sobriety, but for Lisa, they lasted a whole year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Auntie, please feel at ease staying here. My parents passed away when I was very young, so from now on, you are like a second mother to me. So please don't worry or feel uneasy staying here. If there's anything that makes you uncomfortable, please don't hesitate to tell me." Valda spoke softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa said with relief, "Valda, I know you're a good kid. When I saved you before, I never expected anything in return. Besides, I wasn't sure if I could adapt to living in this big city, and..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa hesitated for a moment, unsure whether or not to continue speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Godmother, if there's anything you want to say between us, just go ahead and say it," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can tell that Brian is a good person, he treats you well and he's been good to me too. But I'm just a country girl and I can see that Brian seems pretty wealthy. He has a villa to live in, a car to drive, and he can even afford to hire a caregiver for me. If you bring me over to live with you now, and I embarrass you in any way, would that affect your relationship with Brian and your future marriage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa is afraid that her rural background and inability to speak well will have a negative impact on her goddaughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To Valda, who initially saved the other person, it was just an act of kindness at first. Because her own daughter had passed away, she hoped to do everything in her power to save Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as they spent more time together, she began to treat Valda like her own daughter and took care of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, Valda accepted the role of being a godmother. She cried for a long time and was also happy for a long time. She never expected that when she grew old, God would give her another daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What's even more unexpected is that now, this daughter is living in a big city that her parent never even dared to dream of bringing her to before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All of this actually made her feel a bit anxious, afraid that she might ruin her goddaughter's wedding plans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godmother, don't worry, you won't affect my marriage with Brian. The reason why Brian and I are so happy now is all because of you saving me. As for you, just enjoy your life here from now on." Valda said.</p></div>
