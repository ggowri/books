        <h1>Chapter 915</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had said that she would one day beg to be his sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, everything he said came true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she said, "I&hellip; I'll be your sister, so can you save Kyla and Nelson from Martin Weiss now? Then send someone to protect them, at least... Martin Weiss can't touch them that way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was her decision. If becoming Jason's sister was the only way to assure Kyla and Nelson's safety, then she was willing to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had given her a hand when she was in trouble while Nelson... was so pure that she could not help protecting him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." With a satisfied smile, he took out his phone, dialed Terrence's number, and gave him the orders. Then, he looked at Grace. "Is that alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long will it take to know if Kyla and Nelson have left safely?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It shouldn't take long. Alright, let's eat, Sis," he said gently, smiling like how he used to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered and stiffly picked up her chopsticks to dig in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She ate the delicious food but found them tasteless. All she could think about was Kyla and Nelson. She hoped Kyla would not harm herself again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not say anything. He would just place some food into her bowl from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The vast third floor was quiet except for the sound of the two of them eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Jason's phone rang. Grace was suddenly shocked and looked straight at his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed the answer button and put it on speaker. All at once, Grace could hear Terrence's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We've saved Kyla and Nelson Corbyn from Martin Weiss, Master Reed," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have they suffered any injuries?" Grace asked hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, they didn&rsquo;t suffer any injuries, but Miss Corbyn isn&rsquo;t emotionally stable. She probably needs a good rest," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Send someone to protect them and tell Martin Weiss that as long as Kyla and Nelson Corbyn are in Emerald City, no one can touch them," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call, Jason looked up at Grace. "Are you satisfied with this solution?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was finally relieved. Kyla was not hurt, and Jason had asked Terrence to warn Martin Weiss. Kyla and Nelson would probably be safe in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his eyebrows slightly. "Have you forgotten? You're my sister. I would do anything for you, so you need not thank me at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stiffened a little as she lowered her head, not wanting to meet those eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, I'm his sister now!' However, it was different from before. Now, she seemed to be caught in the net he had spread and could not break free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they were done with dinner, Jason sent Grace back to the rental house. "Do you want to stay here or move back to Reed Residence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened. 'Reed Residence... It's full of sweet memories of both our time together. However, the sweeter the memories are, the more painful it&rsquo;ll be for me to go back!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be fine here. I'm... used to living here now," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll have my things brought over later," he said.</p></div>
