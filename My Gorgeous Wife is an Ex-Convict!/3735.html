        <h1>Chapter 3733</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for him, he has no feelings for her in these years. All emotions related to her have been hypnotized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, he is willing to try to date her, and she should be grateful that she still has a chance to get close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending about half an hour, Veronica finally found the books she wanted and then left the library with Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any place you want to go next?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her, "You can do whatever you want for the next date, I can satisfy you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." Her heartbeat suddenly accelerated again. Come on, boy, does he know how suggestive his words are? Isn't he afraid that she will make some unreasonable demands?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, don't you have anything you want to do?" He looked at her dumbfoundedly and asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, um... how about we grab a bite to eat first and then catch a movie or something?" she suggested, unsure of what else to do with him at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," he agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica found a mall with a movie theater. The fifth and sixth floors of the mall had restaurants, while the seventh floor had the theater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have a restaurant in mind?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not really," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about a spicy fish hotpot place?" she suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fine with me," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the two of them went to a spicy fish hotpot restaurant, and Veronica ordered the dishes. After ordering, she said, "I'm going to use the restroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restroom was outside the restaurant, and there were several restrooms on the same floor. Veronica followed the mall's signs to the restroom, but suddenly heard someone calling out, "Veronica!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica turned around, she saw that it was Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still wearing his delivery uniform and holding a food container. He must have come here to pick up an order!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cross, hello," Veronica smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you here at the mall by yourself today?" Daniel asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm here with my friend. I just came out to use the restroom," Veronica replied. "Well, Mr. Cross, you're busy, so I won't keep you any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Daniel suddenly stopped Veronica in her tracks. Even though he knew he had to deliver the food quickly, he couldn't help but want to talk to her a little longer. "Is </span><span>your phone number still the same as before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," she said, but she had already blocked his phone number, and she didn't tell him that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I contact you in the future?" He gathered his courage and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think it's better not to. Everything between us ended in high school, and there's no need to keep in touch," Veronica refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? If you don't hate me, maybe we can be friends again," Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Mr. Cross, I don't want to be friends with you again," Veronica refused and tried to avoid Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel suddenly grabbed her hand, "Veronica, we've met twice in a short time. Don't you think it's fate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Veronica could answer, another cold voice interrupted, "There was never any fate between you and her!"</span></p></div>
