        <h1>Chapter 3942</h1>
        <div><p>Even her kisses seemed to be trying to please him.</p><p>But when Mick pressed Nancy onto the bed, her slender body trembled slightly, revealing her nervousness and unease.</p><p>Mick couldn&#x27;t help but laugh. He almost forced himself on a drunken, trembling woman.</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t be nervous, sleep well. I won&#x27;t touch you again,&quot; he said, straightening up and preparing to leave.</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; she grabbed his arm. &quot;I want... to sleep together!&quot;</p><p>Even though she was drunk, she still remembered this.</p><p>Mick looked at the woman in front of him. It was more accurate to say that she was obsessed with sleeping with him than interested in him.</p><p>Why was she so obsessed? What did she want from him?</p><p>He rarely became interested in someone.</p><p>&quot;Is it okay?&quot; Suddenly, she exerted force and leaned on him, her small head lowered, looking at him who was pressed under her. Her tone was like a spoiled child, yet pleading.</p><p>Mick&#x27;s eyes deepened, and after a while, he slowly said, &quot;Okay.&quot;</p><p>...</p><p>The next morning, when Nancy opened her eyes, she found that she was not lying in her rented room. What came into view was a strange ceiling.</p><p>Her chaotic mind began to replay memories bit by bit.</p><p>Right... She and Mick came to the hotel to book a room together.</p><p>Then, when Mick went to take a shower, she drank some alcohol to relieve her tension.</p><p>But after that, her memory became a bit fuzzy. She only vaguely remembered that after Mick came out, she walked up to him and tried to imitate the actions of women in movies and TV shows when they tried to seduce men...</p><p>After that... it was blank...</p><p>Now she was in bed. Where was Mick?</p><p>Nancy suddenly sat up, lowered her head and slightly pulled open the collar of her bathrobe to look at her body. It seemed... nothing was unusual.</p><p>The physical sensation wasn&#x27;t the sour and painful experience described in movies and novels. Instead, it was quite refreshing. The only discomfort was a throbbing headache, similar to the feeling after getting drunk.</p><p>What happened between Nancy and Mick last night? As she pondered this question, a voice suddenly interrupted her thoughts, &quot;What&#x27;s up? What are you looking at?&quot;</p><p>Nancy suddenly looked up and saw that Mick was already dressed in a suit and leather shoes, walking towards her.</p><p>She felt like she was going to die of embarrassment. Her hand was still pulling open the collar of her bathrobe, and he had just seen everything!</p><p>Nancy quickly pulled her collar together and blushed, &quot;N-nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You were pretty forward last night, why are you so shy now?&quot; Mick approached her and asked.</p><p>Nancy hesitated and asked, &quot;Was I, uh, very forward last night?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, you were.&quot; He confirmed.</p><p>&quot;D-did we...you know...do it?&quot; Her face turned even redder, and it took her a while to finish her sentence.</p><p>He looked at her and joked, &quot;What do you mean by &#x27;it&#x27;?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I mean...I mean...&quot; She kept biting her lips, making him a little impatient.</p><p>He reached out and touched her lips, &quot;Okay, stop biting. If you&#x27;re asking if we had sex, then I can tell you, we didn&#x27;t.&quot;</p><p>She blinked her eyes, feeling relieved but also a little disappointed.</p></div>
