        <h1>Chapter 464</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Frowning slightly, Jason took the phone from Terrence. He played the video by tapping on the phone screen, and his eyes were suddenly cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air pressure around his body was so low that even though Terrence knew that the boss was not angry at him, he felt like he was about to be frozen to death as he stood there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Emerald City would shake when Young Master Reed got angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the Atkinson family had embarrassed Miss Cummins who was Young Master Reed's precious darling. Young Master Reed himself would not bear to wrong Miss Cummins, but now the Atkinson family had humiliated Miss Cummins a great deal in public. A video was even taken and posted on the internet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Delete this video from the internet and don't let me see it on there ever again! Also, find the person who took the video and delete the original footage from his phone," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gave Terrence his phone back and picked up his coat which was lying aside. Then, he walked out of his office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence knew even without asking that Young Master Reed was going to see Miss Cummins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that only Grace was able to make Young Master Reed care so much. That was why sometimes the so-called fate between people was a really strange thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought Young Master Reed would be interested in Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, the Atkinson family would not have thought of that either. If they had, they probably would not have treated Grace that way! Terrence thought so in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason left the company in his car. He was dialing Grace's phone number as he drove along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the call was not picked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This made him even more anxious, so he called Reed Residence's butler and asked about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins went out in the morning and came back around noon. However, she didn't take lunch after getting back. She went straight to her room and never came out," replied the butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Keep an eye on her for me!" ordered Jason. He ended the call and drove toward Reed Residence at breakneck speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he got back to Reed Residence, he got out of the car and ran to Grace's room, much to the surprise of the servants he passed by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When had they ever seen Young Master Reed in such a hurry? It was like he was worried about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what was there in Emerald City that could worry Young Master Reed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The butler stood in the doorway of Grace's room. As soon as he saw Jason, he said, "Miss Cummins is in the room, Young Master. I knocked, but Miss Cummins wouldn't open it. She locked the door from the inside again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he had the key to the room, he was afraid to use it to open Miss Cummins's room without the young master's orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason waved his hand and said, "You can leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about the key to the room..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't need it," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The butler left, and Jason raised his hand to knock on the door gently. He cried out, "It's me, Sis!"</p></div>
