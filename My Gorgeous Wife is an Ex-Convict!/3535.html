        <h1>Chapter 3533</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once they were outside the office, Veronica didn't stop walking and continued forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was in front, and he was behind. As she walked, she could feel his gaze fixed on her, like a prickling sensation on her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, his voice rang out, "Where exactly are you taking me? If we keep going, we'll be out of the campus."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's steps abruptly halted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned around and looked at Mason. "Do you really have to transfer? Even if...even if you say you've forgotten all the feelings between us, you can still finish high school here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As I said before, there's no need," he said flatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it really unnecessary? Or...do you hate me?" She suddenly asked like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes looked at her steadily, and after a moment, his lips slowly opened, "It's hate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her body stiffened, and her face suddenly became extremely pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she asked this question herself, when she really heard him answer like this, her heart still hurt badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And many things she wanted to say originally, at this moment, were stuck in her throat, and she couldn't say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you let go now?" His voice rose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She only just realized that she had been holding onto his wrist this whole time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, she asked, "For my final question, I want to know, what was Mason thinking in the moment of hypnosis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze flickered slightly. She had asked about Mason, not Mason himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them locked eyes, staring at each other like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, he finally said, "What I'm thinking is that from now on, I can finally stop liking you and no longer feel like I've lost everything in life because of your rejection."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's body trembled, and her fingers slowly loosened, stiffening in the process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turned out that her rejection of him had weighed so heavily on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was she wrong? Did she misunderstand his rejection of Daniel and his desire to no longer be her brother, but her boyfriend, as just a child's obsession with a toy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she forgot to consider that he was no longer a child and that his feelings for her could also change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She never thought that he actually liked her romantically, so it's only natural that she chooses to leave now and not continue to be with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, I'm sorry," she whispered, finally letting go of his wrist. Her gaze fell on his face, as if she wanted to see him clearly and remember him well. "And I hope you never feel like you've lost your whole life again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From now on, they will truly become...strangers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time flies faster than one can imagine. Mason's transfer marked the official end of their relationship. Eventually, their classmates realized what had happened and began to mock Veronica as the ugly duckling who had returned to her original form.</p></div>
