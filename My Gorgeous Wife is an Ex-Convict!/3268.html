        <h1>Chapter 3266</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, everything is good, that's good!" said the old Mr. Hart with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda is pregnant now and her body is different than before. She needs to be taken care of more carefully. Pregnant women can have bad tempers, so you need to go along with her. If she hits you, don't hit back. If she scolds you, don't talk back. You need to do whatever she asks, but don't make her angry. If she gets upset and harms the baby, I won't let it go!" said Mrs. Hart sternly to her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian gave his mother a blank look and said, "Do you think I wouldn't go along with Valda?" Even if Valda wasn't pregnant, he would still be completely obedient to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am reminding you!" glared old Mrs. Hart at her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, a reminder, a reminder!" said the old Mr. Hart. "When your mother was pregnant with you, I went through the same thing. This is somewhat of a tradition in our family, isn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian raised his eyebrows, wondering why he didn't know about this tradition before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What does Valda like to eat lately? Sweet or sour? Is there anything she needs? I'll go buy it for her!" exclaimed Mrs. Hart, eager to help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't lack anything, I have prepared everything for her," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, despite saying that, the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart still bought a lot of things and came to the villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at the pile of maternity clothes, pregnancy pillows, and various brands of snacks, and suddenly felt that the in-laws and Brian were quite similar in some ways.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart were enthusiastic about Valda's pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old Mr. Hart, being a man, found it difficult to speak about certain things, so the old Mrs. Hart took the initiative to talk to Valda. After whispering for a while, Valda's face turned red again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they were leaving, the old Mrs. Hart reminded Valda, "If you feel that Brian is not treating you well, just tell me and I'll teach him a lesson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, Brian is treating me very well," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that his son and daughter-in-law had a good relationship, the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart were naturally very happy. After they left with smiles on their faces, Brian asked Valda, "What did Mom say to you just now? Your face turned red."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" She blinked, surprised that he noticed her blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, just that Mom said we should restrain ourselves during this pregnancy period, so as not to harm the baby," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see. We should definitely restrain ourselves, but I think it's okay to hug and kiss," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lowered his body and kissed her on the face as he spoke. For him, not being able to "touch" her for a while was indeed a significant test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as long as she and the child are safe, that's all that matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh, it's okay," Valda sweetly smiled and wrapped her arms around Brian's neck, then leaned in to kiss him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just over 8 months, they will be able to see their child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That will surely be a wonderful day!</p></div>
