        <h1>Chapter 3034</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today is Saturday, no need to go to class," said Simon, with a glimmer of anticipation in his beautiful eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at those hopeful eyes, Valda couldn't refuse anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George said, "Simon, come here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Simon seemed to ignore it, while Grace held onto Valda's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked hesitant, glancing at the child and then at Brian. "Brian, this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll listen to you." Brian directly handed over the decision-making power to Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda thought for a moment and said to George, "Mr. Gregory, if you're comfortable with it, why don't we let Simon play with us today? We'll make sure to send him back to the Gregory family afterwards."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George said, "How can this be appropriate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I actually quite like Simon," said Valda. She just doesn't like Simon's dad!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George sighed as he looked at his son who was holding Valda's hand tightly and refused to let go. "Alright then, I'll trouble you with this. But you don't have to go out of your way to send Simon back to the Gregory family. I'll come and pick him up myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George then gave some instructions to his son before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda, Brian, and Simon started their journey for the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the sake of convenience during his trip, Brian had arranged for a car to be provided by the subsidiary of Hart Group, Deer Capital, at this location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, Brian is driving while Simon and Valda are sitting in the back seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to come out and play with us? Today we're just visiting some ordinary sights in Deer Capital that you've probably already been to, so you might find it boring," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just don't want to stay at home and deal with my grandparents and dad," Simon said with a bit of an old-fashioned tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was surprised, "Oh, why? They should treat you well, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She heard from Brian that the Gregory family only has one child, Simon. Because of this, Amber had thought about getting custody of the child, but the Gregory family was not willing to give it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's good, but... my grandparents don't like mommy. I've heard them say that mommy is a bad woman and that she's the reason why daddy is like this now. And they keep talking about finding me a new mommy all the time!" Simon said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Valda could only sigh and think that every family has their own difficulties to face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what about you, what do you think?" she asked. Children at this age are generally precocious and have their own ideas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Valda didn't treat the other person as a child, but asked them in an equal and inquiring tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon remained silent, and Valda didn't push him. It was as if he could speak if he wanted to, but if he didn't want to, then he didn't have to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Simon said, "I don't like it when they speak ill of Mommy. It was clearly Daddy who caused Mommy's suffering! I've read many reports and even searched online. Many people online say that if Daddy had helped Mommy at that time, she wouldn't have suffered so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your father must be regretting it now," said Valda. Although she didn't like George, she could tell from his eyes that there was a sense of despair towards life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The impact of these things on that man can be imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want a new mommy either," Simon said. "I don't want to stay at home, and I don't want to go to school. It seems like everyone is being very careful around me, whispering behind my back and not wanting me to know what they're saying. But actually, I know what they're talking about!"</p></div>
