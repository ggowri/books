        <h1>Chapter 889</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servant went to prepare the soup. Hadwin made Lina sit on the couch and said, "I'll send you home after you finish the soup."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina only mumbled, "I don't want to go back. I want to watch more. Send&hellip; Send me back. I want to look at those hunks..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she said seemed to trigger Hadwin. "Hunks? Lina, I'm not even done with you. You told me you have work, but instead, you went to that bar. Have I spoiled you too much that you'd dare to do such a thing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina winced a little. Although she was drunk, she somehow knew it was her fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How... How did you find me? I... I didn't tell you I was going to the bar!" she murmured as though she was dissatisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You tell me!" He grunted in annoyance. He would not have found out if it were not for the photo she posted on her Instagram.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She groaned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Give me that vest," said Hadwin. The sight of her clutching another man's worn vest annoyed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" Lina immediately shook her head and clenched the vest tighter. "I tried&hellip; Uh... I tried really hard to get this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tried really hard?" Hadwin laughed out of anger. "Why did you grab their vest?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As a... souvenir, of course. You don't know how handsome they are..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh?" There was a touch of danger in his voice. He leaned over as his hands rested on the couch beside her. "How handsome?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just... incredibly handsome... Dynamic... Charming..." She was a little tongue-tied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were suddenly no good adjectives in her drunken brain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was close to hers. "Who's more charming?" There was a bewitching smile on the corner of his mouth that made his feminine face more gorgeous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she dared call them charming, then he wanted her to regret it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin had no good idea about how &lsquo;good-looking&rsquo; they were. After all, Lina was always good at taking advantage of his softheartedness for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was nothing he could do to her if she started acting helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could be tough with everyone except her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin had always looked somewhat indifferent. His delicate features were like God&rsquo;s masterpiece, and his smile could easily seduce people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least Lina could not take her eyes off Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course&hellip; You are..." She held a hand out and touched his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Good. She didn't say it&rsquo;s the five men!' Hadwin felt a little better now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he wanted to grab the vest, she refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin said fiercely to her, "Lina, if you don't let go, believe it or not, I'll..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was about to say something threatening, but he stopped when he was about to say it. He was afraid that she would be frightened if he was too fierce, but if he said it too gently, she would not care at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the incumbent patriarch of the Stephenson family was caught in a dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a good while, Hadwin finally spat out the words. "Believe it or not, I'll tell your parents about what you have done tonight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he finished, Hadwin suddenly found himself behaving like a kid who was bullied, saying things like, &lsquo;I'm going to tell the teacher!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Since when do I have to use such a method?' Hadwin gave a wry smile.</p></div>
