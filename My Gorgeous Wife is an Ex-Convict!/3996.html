        <h1>Chapter 3994</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the private room, there was finally only him left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick closed his eyes and reached towards the part of his body where his blood was concentrated. The image that appeared in his mind was surprisingly Nancy's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a month since she resigned, and she had already arranged with the landlord to sublet her rental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had packed all the luggage she needed to take, bought her high-speed train ticket, and in two days, she would completely leave Emerald City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a small person like her, leaving a city would have no impact on the city whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a drop of water leaving a pond, and no one would care!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only two days left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy walked aimlessly on the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the last two days she had in Emerald City, she wanted to take a good look at the city where she grew up and where she met Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the future, she might never set foot in Emerald City again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she passed by the People's Park in Emerald City, her footsteps suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the place where she had wanted to come with Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw the news, it mentioned a hundred-year-old tree in the People's Park that many young people had worshipped as a wishing tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people would come to the tree to make wishes. Even the park had set up a wishing </span><span>fence next to the tree. Tourists could buy wishing ribbons launched by the park, tie them to the fence after making a wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Nancy's opinion, this was more like a revenue-generating project launched by the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there are many posts online that say this wishing tree is very effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Nancy mentioned it to Mick at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he said, "Then let's go together in the future, make a wish, and see if it really works."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no "future" between them in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Nancy arrived at the wishing tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because this tree is very famous online, it was not difficult to find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the fence under the tree, Nancy saw many ribbons of different colors tied up. Were there thousands or tens of thousands?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stood under the tree, several other tourists were also there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some female tourists even had their hands clasped together, obviously making a wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that women always believe in wishing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy went to the small shop next to the tree and bought a ribbon for wishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she clasped her hands together under the tree and made a serious wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First wish: Mick can be safe and healthy in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second wish: Mick can be happy and joyful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Third wish: One day in the future, Mick can find someone he truly loves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when making her third wish, Nancy still feels a sharp pain in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knows that she and Mick can never be together in this lifetime!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still feels the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much longer will it take for her to let go of her feelings for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or will she hold onto this hopeless love for the rest of her life, until she's old and gray and lying in her coffin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making her wish, Nancy opens her eyes and walks to the fence, tying the wish ribbon onto it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her three wishes can really come true, that would be great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she turns around after tying the ribbon, she suddenly freezes at the sight of a figure not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is Mick...here?!</span></p></div>
