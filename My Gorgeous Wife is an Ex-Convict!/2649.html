        <h1>Chapter 2647</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the two were photographed by a reporter nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gloria was obviously used to it as he looked comfortable, but Valda Theller blushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you not used to being in front of the camera?" Gloria asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Yeah. Mr. Stephenson, you're always in the spotlight, so you must be used to being photographed like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gloria smiled lightly. "Yes, it has been years. Even if I wasn't used to it at first, I'm used to it now. I heard that you used to go to the same university as Mr. Raymond Bowman, the CEO of Future Technology. Did Mr. Bowman invest in this drama because of you, Miss Theller?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's expression stiffened slightly as she said awkwardly, "I have nothing to do with him. I just found out he invested in this drama today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? I thought you were good friends," Gloria said with a laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pressed her red lips together. She and Raymond Bowman would probably never be friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The booting ceremony finally came to an end after more than half a day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller called Brian on the phone. "Brian, I'm almost done." Although they had agreed to call each other only by their first names to be more like a couple, she still felt a little sheepish when she called him Brian. She felt her heartbeat quicken too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, what's the closest film studio exit to you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Exit B3," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you at exit B3 in 10 minutes," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller answered in acknowledgment. 10 minutes later, she came to the exit they agreed on and saw Brian's car already there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she hurried forward. She was about to walk toward the car when a hand suddenly seized hers, stopping her. "Don't go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned around and saw Raymond Bowman's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, what are you doing?" Valda Theller struggled and twisted her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I did fool you, but I don't want to see you get fooled again." The memory of her being bullied and laughed at by others had haunted him for years, and it had become a nightmare. "Valda, I don't know why this man approached you, but do you really think he's serious about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's none of your business whether he's serious or not," she snapped at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'None of my business...' Raymond Bowman smiled bitterly. How could it be none of his business? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I said it has something to do with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller paused and looked at Raymond Bowman blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wonder what you have to do with our relationship." A cold voice suddenly rang out. Brian had gotten out of the car at some point and walked up to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda is my ex-girlfriend. She can be my girlfriend again anytime she wants," Raymond Bowman said sternly. He still did not know what kind of feelings he had for Valda Theller, but he knew that he wanted to make up for hurting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she were willing, he would treat her well and as his real girlfriend this time. There would be no more lying and hurting. He could also help her boost her career and make her a well-known comic artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes darkened. Then, he looked at Valda Theller. "What about you? Whose girlfriend do you want to be?" It was like a simple inquiry without emotion.</p></div>
