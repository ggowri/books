        <h1>Chapter 616</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only one who could make him be dominated willingly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she asked him to kneel before her, he would do it willingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All he wanted was for her to not leave him... No matter what happened, he did not want her to leave him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father must have loved his mother this much too. However, his mother eventually left his father, leaving him in despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was not his mother. Grace would not leave him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was over, Grace panted and blushed. She tried to step back, but Jason put his arm around her waist and pulled her even closer into his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" She looked at him quizzically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me you won't leave me." He lowered his head. His bright eyes gazed at her deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked her eyes and said with a smile, "Of course, I won't leave you. What made you think of that suddenly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's probably because..." He hesitated a little but said anyway, "My mom and dad just crossed my mind. The more you love someone, the more you're afraid of losing them. Because once you lose them, you'll only be greeted with despair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze. She seldom heard him speak of his mother. She only knew that his mother had left his father when they were in great poverty and that his father had died in the snow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It... Seemed like a lifetime of pain to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only a child back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mind went back to the first time they met. He was sitting in the snow in his father's old clothes, looking so empty and cold!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt a pang in her heart again. She was feeling sorry for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said to Jason, "Bend over, Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glistened a little, but he bent over as she wished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's arms went around his head, pressing his face into her arms. His cheek was against her heart, and in his ear, he could hear the beating of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, as long as you love me, I won't leave you. I won't leave you in despair." She had experienced loss and despair more than anyone else. "Therefore, you don't need to worry about anything. We'll always be together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice was so soft and soothing to his ears, making him feel relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will we always be together?" he asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Unless you don't love me anymore one day. When that happens, I'll leave," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart gave a sudden quiver. Whatever the possibility, the mere fact that she said it made him shudder. He could not accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He straightened up suddenly and stared at her as he said. "There's no way I won't love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help laughing. "I'm just making an assumption."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not even an assumption! Grace, I'll love you until I die!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at him, her nose suddenly feeling a little sore. 'Until he dies? Does he know he&rsquo;s talking about a lifelong commitment?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If there was anyone in the world who loved her most, then she thought it must be him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Never before had she thought that there was a man in the world who loved her so deeply. He was even... A man she had feared so much previously.</p></div>
