        <h1>Chapter 3127</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them walked slowly forward. Brian was already handsome, even without the prince's aura, he still attracted attention. Valda, on the other hand, limped as she walked, hobbling along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This combination naturally drew attention. Along the way, some passersby would glance at them with strange looks, and even some people whispered and discussed in private.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, Valda didn't lower her head as usual, trying not to attract attention. Instead, she continued to walk with her head held high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since she couldn't stop others' strange looks, what she could do was to face them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No fear, no inferiority!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Brian, standing beside Valda, naturally felt her change, and a smile appeared on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there anything you want to eat?" There were many food and tea shops along the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Milk tea, I haven't had it in a while, and I feel like drinking it." She said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then said, "Okay, you rest on the chair for a while, I'll go buy it." Because they were now on a pedestrian street, there were many benches on both sides of the street for pedestrians to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." Valda nodded and sat down on the chair. Brian asked her what flavor of milk tea she wanted, then went to the front of the store to queue up for the purchase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Brian standing in the queue, and even among a group of people, Grace stood out so prominently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the queue, there were mostly young girls, and even if there were men, they were mostly young guys dressed casually. He seemed to be the only mature man dressed in a suit and leather shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While waiting in line, many girls looked at Brian sideways, but he seemed completely unaware of the people around him and only occasionally looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A man who was willing to queue up to buy bubble tea warmed Valda's heart. It's a pity that her phone is being repaired at the moment, otherwise she would have liked to take a picture to keep as a memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she will always keep this scene in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as it was finally Brian's turn and he had bought his bubble tea, two young girls suddenly walked up to him. One of the girls had a blushing face and seemed to have said something to him. Brian replied expressionlessly, causing the girl's shy expression to change. She then looked towards Valda with a slightly glaring gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked confused and blinked her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then the girl said a few words to Brian, who replied shortly. The girl looked embarrassed and ran away, while the other girl quickly followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian walked up to Valda and handed her the bubble tea he was holding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took the milk tea and took a sip, asking, "What did that girl say to you just now? It's not a confession, is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm." He responded lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blinked her eyes again, it was indeed a confession... Handsome people really get confessed to everywhere. "Did you tell her that I'm your girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda guessed that otherwise the girl wouldn't have turned her head and glared at her like that.</p></div>
