        <h1>Chapter 2895</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's quite ridiculous, isn't it? I didn't even know that a small injury of mine would force a classmate to transfer schools. After that, many classmates were afraid to play with me, and gradually, I got used to it," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's heart was filled with a wave of pain for his young age!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her original impression, she always thought that a scion like him would have everything he wanted in his childhood, and there would be countless people around him trying to flatter him. How could there be any loneliness?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, she realized that some things were so different from what she had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Later, I saw them eating this kind of ice cream, and I also wanted to eat it, so I bought one. I don't know why, but I just felt it was particularly delicious," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened next? Did you play alone in the amusement park? Didn't your family come to find you?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, they did. They almost turned Emerald City upside down to find me. When they found me, my parents knew that I had sneaked here alone to play, so after a few days, they brought me here to play again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't that good?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it good?" he sneered, "Yes, maybe in their eyes, it's good. They have always spoiled me, so that day, they rented out the entire amusement park, and besides the staff, my family, servants, and bodyguards, there were no other visitors. To be precise, there was only me as a visitor!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was stunned. She never thought that his parents would rent out the entire amusement park for him to play alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That day, I played with all the facilities here and ate this ice cream again. But when I ate it for the second time, I didn't think it was delicious anymore. Since then, I have never been to this amusement park again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the man in front of her. The little boy he used to be was just a lonely child who longed for the company of friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But...this simple thing for ordinary people seemed to be difficult for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So at that time, I told myself that if I came for the third time, I would not come alone," he said, his gaze falling on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if her heart had been hit hard, so...is this his third time here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to her, who had only beautiful memories here, his memories didn't seem to be so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart finished his ice cream bite by bite, his gaze falling on her. "Valda Theller, if we have children in the future, can we bring them here together? Like these parents, queuing with their children, swiping their cards to buy tickets, and fighting for positions together. I will try to be a good father."</p></div>
