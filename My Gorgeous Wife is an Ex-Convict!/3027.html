        <h1>Chapter 3025</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day when Valda saw Camille, Camille looked at the marks on her neck and smiled in a very flirtatious way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems like you listened to my advice well yesterday!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's face turned red, "Do you know that Brian saw the document you sent me yesterday and the words you typed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille raised her eyebrows and said, "So he's quite a hands-on person!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was speechless for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In short, you had a good time last night, right?" Camille winked and said, "As long as you follow the instructions in the file I gave you, you'll be able to get pregnant in no time. My relatives have tried it themselves and the success rate is very high."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda twitched her mouth corner and said, "Thank you for your kindness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wherever, whenever you have a child in the future, remember to have them call me 'godmother'," Camille laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them chatted for a while and then brought up the topic of the exchange meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The exchange meeting will last for a week. The airfare and accommodation will be covered by the other side, so you don't need to pay for them yourself. After you get off the plane, you will need to make your own way to the hotel," Camille explained the details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda listened and then took the various documents that Camille handed to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you okay with staying alone in Deer Capital for a week? Do you want me to come over and keep you company over the weekend?" Camille asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, everything's fine. I've been to unfamiliar cities before, I'm not alone in this!" In the past, she had traveled to several cities alone to gather materials for her stories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, if you feel lonely at that time, remember to give me a call!" Camille smiled and said, "But since you and Brian will be apart for a week, I guess if you feel lonely, you'll probably call him instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One week's time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt a bit reluctant at the thought of being separated from Brian for a week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only felt a little reluctant for half a day. When they returned to the villa that night and Valda mentioned her plan to go to Deer Capital, Brian said, "I'll go with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was stunned, "You want to accompany me to Deer Capital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But isn't your job...very busy?" He is the CEO of Hart Group, shouldn't he be swamped with work?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Work schedule can be adjusted, it's not difficult to take a week off. Besides, I can also handle some things for you when you're busy," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if that's the case, won't you be too tired?" Valda hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he accompanied her, which was nice for her, she didn't want him to go through too much trouble just to be with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Rather than being separated from you for a week, I would rather endure some hardship," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt an extra sweetness in her heart as she listened to these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... you need to book your plane ticket now, I have already booked mine," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need to book, just charter a plane directly," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda almost choked on her own saliva, "A...chartered flight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have any questions?" he instead asked strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked her eyes and thought, well, chartering a plane might be a pretty ordinary thing for him, but for her, it was definitely not ordinary!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um...this flight to Deer Capital only takes a little over 2 hours, so there's no need for a chartered flight," she said awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, I'll buy my plane ticket later. Can you send me your flight information later?" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the day of the convention drew nearer, Valda grew more and more excited. She talked incessantly to Brian about the various cartoonists who would be attending the event.</p></div>
