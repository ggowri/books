        <h1>Chapter 753</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Grace's heart could not help trembling. His eyes... Were indifferent and aloof, as if he was looking at an insignificant stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A strange sense of loss burst out of her heart. It was so quick that she was a little surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why do I feel a sense of loss? Is it because the boy, who had shared hardships with me when we were little, is taking me as a stranger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... I chose this, didn&rsquo;t I?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even if I&rsquo;m the one who saved Brian... I've made my choice. I've decided to choose Jay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don't want to upset Jay. I don't want the man who loves me to look so fragile and insecure. Therefore, whether I lost my memories or not, I'm not going to restore anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's it. Keep it that way.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a wry smile and lowered her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay, who was standing beside Brian, looked at Grace with hostility. Then, she looked at Brian with concern, fearing that Brian would act differently after seeing Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Brian held on to Grace at this event like he did at the fair last time, she would be embarrassed in front of her relatives and neighbors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, her relatives and neighbors thought she might be Brian's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Brian only gave Grace a cold glance and stopped looking at her, which made Stella Lindsay feel relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In any case, she could not let Brian find out the truth. She would insist to the death that she was the one who saved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After offering the incense, Stella Lindsay walked over to Grace with sisterly affection and said, "Grace, you're here too. Where's Jason? He didn't come with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's coming this afternoon," Grace said lightly, looking at her cousin. 'I didn't know how she convinced Brian that she&rsquo;s the little girl who saved him when he was little. Is it just because she told him the little boy and the little girl's experience on the hill?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace did not have this memory of her childhood, in her opinion, she would not be too specific if she had told Stella about her experiences with the little boy on the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides, after so many years, it&rsquo;s a problem how much Sis could remember.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sis cheated Brian just like that. Is Brian so easy to fool? Or is Sis too devious?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's gaze made Stella Lindsay feel guilty. It was as if she saw through her or something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I have a few words that I want to talk to you about." Stella Lindsay pulled Grace aside into a corner and lowered her voice as she said, "Well... Brian took your hand at the fair last time. What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was curious about it, but Brian would not say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said lightly, "Nothing. I just said some nonsense that he seemed to have misunderstood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then, you mustn't let him misunderstand anything again!" complained Stella Lindsay. "Just because I told you about saving Brian when I was little, you kept uttering strange things in front of him, which led to his misunderstanding. You already have Jason, so why bother Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt as if she had belittled her cousin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had always felt that her cousin did not receive much education, so even if she was scheming, she could not hide it. She would show it on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect that her cousin would know how to turn the facts upside down.</p></div>
