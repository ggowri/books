        <h1>Chapter 2686</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only came to see Valda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn&rsquo;t have to come. Valda needs to rest. Get out!" Camille Strickland wanted to kick Raymond Bowman out, but she was not strong enough to pull him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I had no idea those guys were really beating you. I didn't know you were suffering!" he said, looking guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said coldly, "You don't need to apologize. You're nobody to me. You're not obliged to do anything for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I&ndash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland suddenly interrupted Raymond Bowman. "No buts! Valda doesn't need your concern. All she needs is her boyfriend. I'll call for the hospital security guards if you don't leave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman said, "Boyfriend? Is that man really Valda's boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he pushed Camille Strickland aside and walked to Valda Theller's bedside. "Valda, do you know who your boyfriend is? How much do you know about him? You said you love him very much and get along with him, but do you know that he was deeply in love with a woman before this? He didn't hesitate to save her with his life. There are even rumors that he was willing to never marry in his life just because of that woman. Even though that woman has been married for years and even has children now, he has never dated any woman!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's words struck Valda Theller's heart like a hammer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he talking about... Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She always knew that Brian had someone he loved, and that person should be the woman called Grace she saw the last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They pretended to date to make her believe that he really had a girlfriend. It was why he pretended to hug her in the parking lot. It was just to make others see that they were in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect Brian to love that woman that much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What would those cold but indifferent eyes look like when they were full of affection?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That man is Brian. He&rsquo;s also the president of the Hart Group and the crown prince of the entertainment industry!" Raymond Bowman bent over, put his hands on Valda Theller's shoulders, looked her straight in the eye, and said, "Valda, he&rsquo;s not sincere. That man doesn't love you at all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt as if a great storm had set off in her heart. Facing Raymond Bowman, she had no idea what to say all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian is... the crown prince of the entertainment industry?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she was an outsider, she had heard rumors about the crown prince. However, she did not know the crown prince's name, so she never connected Brian with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those rumors were now overlapping with Brian's figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice rang suddenly. "When is it someone else's turn to judge whether I'm sincere and love Valda?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman stiffened immediately as he turned his head to see a tall figure entering through the ward door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wore a suit, and his handsome face made him look like Prince Charming in fairytales. This man ruled the entertainment industry. Even popular celebrities were only pawns to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Raymond Bowman regarded Brian as a womanizer before, he now had more doubts.</p></div>
