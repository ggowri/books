        <h1>Chapter 1724</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"And it seems to have something to do with that Miss Sweeney, Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s friend. Mr. Stephenson asked where Mrs. Reed's private room is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Manager Wang's heart sank when he heard that. The next moment, he saw a tall figure walking toward him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It's... indeed Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Gosh, what the hell is going on? Why am I so 'lucky' today?' Manager Wang wailed in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson walked to the door of the private room and glanced at Manager Wang standing outside. "Are they still in there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes... Yes, they're in there," Manager Wang said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson opened the door, only to see the swaying Lina playing the finger guessing game with a group of men in the room. Grace was sitting beside Lina while Jason sat on a couch on the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was a little surprised that Jason was also here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Judging from the way Lina looked, he could tell that she probably had a lot to drink. The empty wine bottles in the private room confirmed his speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The men playing the finger guessing game with Lina were relieved when they saw Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Someone had finally come to pick her up. After all, the longer the two women stayed in the private room, the more they had to suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Under Young master Reed's gaze, they dared not even breathe loudly and were so afraid of crossing the line that they had to be extra careful when playing the finger guessing game!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson walked up to Lina. The cold aura emanating from his body could make others shudder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Lina seemed to not feel it. She looked up and suddenly grinned after seeing Hadwin Stephenson. Then, she said to Grace, "Grace, look. Here comes another handsome man!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was speechless! Lina was so drunk that she could not recognize Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But why does he look a little like... Who is it... Oh, why can't I remember..." muttered Lina. She staggered to her feet and approached Hadwin Stephenson. Then, she put her arms around his neck as she stood on tiptoes to position her face nearer to him in an attempt to get a closer look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace thought to herself that her best friend would never do such a thing if she were sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're... pretty. You look... just like a doll." Lina laughed as her right hand moved to Hadwin Stephenson's face, drawing circles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson could not help falling into a trance. She had also been drunk on their first night in the hotel room abroad. She had held him just like this, saying that he was pretty and he looked like a doll...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all these years, she still had not changed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Your face... feels comfortable. It's cold..." said Lina. Then, as if she had something good to share with her best friend, she turned and said to Grace, "Grace, do you... Hiccup... Do you want to touch him too? It feels very comfortable..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, it&rsquo;s alright!" It was Jason who answered her. He looked at Hadwin Stephenson and snapped. "Control this woman. Tell her not to bring Grace to such a place again next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, he dragged Grace out of the private room with her hand in his.</p></div>
