        <h1>Chapter 1322</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gently scooped up a spoonful of fruit soup as she spoke. "Just like the fruits in this soup. Some fruits are sour, while some are sweet. Do you plan to be upset about it every birthday? Besides, are you going to be miserable on my birthday every year?" she quipped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry. I should never have broken up with you!" muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then we'll take this as a warning and never talk about breaking up again, okay?" she said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was stunned. His dark peach blossom eyes stared at her closely. After quite some time, he finally said hoarsely, "Then it's settled. No more mentions of breaking up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright. If you can't think of a present, I'll prepare it myself. You mustn't dislike it," Grace said and lowered her head to drink the fruit soup in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Grace, and a touch of pain flashed across his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it... really settled? Will we never talk about breaking up again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know that my greatest fear is that one day she&rsquo;ll choose to leave me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know how much I wish she can keep her promise, no matter what happens?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little worried about Jason's birthday present. After all, he had everything. Besides, she had given him things like a scarf and gloves before. She could not think of anything else that was meaningful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After visiting Lina at the hospital, Grace asked the driver to drive her to the mall to see what gift options were available.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The news she heard from the hospital was pretty good today. The doctor said Lina responded well after the surgery. All indicators were improving. It would not take long until she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It also made Grace feel better!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After arriving at the mall, Grace began to shop around. Her bodyguard, Huang Qian, naturally followed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to shop in some men&rsquo;s clothing stores because she was choosing a present for Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she reached one of the luxury stores, a familiar voice sounded in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Hart, please. Let Stella go. Stella only impersonated her because... Because she liked you. She... She didn't mean any harm. If she&rsquo;s really sentenced, she... She would have to be imprisoned for life! She's only 29! She's still young. How could she be imprisoned for so long?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked over and saw Third Aunt crying in front of Brian not far away, apparently begging Brian to let Stella go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian's face was cold, and he had no intention of paying them any attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Third Aunt threatened to kneel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said coldly, "I won't drop the case even if you kneel and grovel to me. The judge will give the sentence however he wants. Even if she&rsquo;s sentenced to life imprisonment, she deserves it! Since she dared to do such a thing in the first place, she must be prepared to suffer the consequences!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... But how could Stella have known that the consequences would be so serious? She doesn't know much. She thought she was just impersonating her cousin. It's no... No big deal..." Third Aunt quickly tried to justify the matter. </p></div>
