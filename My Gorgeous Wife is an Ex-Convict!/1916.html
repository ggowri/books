        <h1>Chapter 1914</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A man in a police uniform had his sniper rifle aimed at Katherine Jackson, looking to be on guard. If the first shot did not take her down, he would shoot again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... Katherine Jackson was probably not going to make it. Grace looked at Katherine Jackson as she twitched on the ground. Her expression changed slightly when she saw a device rolling out of Katherine Jackson's pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed like a remote control with a countdown on it. It was counting down. Eight... Seven... Six...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It's a timer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Did Katherine Jackson press the button while it was in her pocket just now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What exactly is this device?' Grace had a bad feeling, but Katherine Jackson could not speak right now. After twitching a few times, she stopped moving as if announcing the passing of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Jason lunged forward and grabbed Grace's arm. "Come on. I&rsquo;ll send you to the hospital!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He bent over to pick her up as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, this..." Grace barely finished speaking when suddenly, there was an explosion. The building instantly began to shake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a bomb!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze, finally understanding what the device that rolled out of Katherine Jackson's pocket was! It was the device that set off the bomb!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Everybody, get out of here!" ordered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The people who worked for Jason were skilled. They had already started looking for the most suitable escape route.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The helicopters hovering in the sky also scrambled to lower their rope ladders. They could bring some people away from the explosion site.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As the explosions continued, parts of the abandoned building began to crack. It would collapse at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason hugged Grace as she tried to steady herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina! Hurry and let Lina board the helicopter!" Grace shouted. Her best friend was pregnant. The safest way to get out of here was by taking the helicopter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't worry, someone will bring Lina to the helicopter!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough, as he finished speaking, two people came to Lina's side and helped her climb up the rope ladder the helicopter had put down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Watching her best friend climb up as she held onto the rope ladder, Grace felt a little calmer now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let's go too," Jason said as he quickly tore the cloth from her sleeve to help her apply pressure on the wound on her neck, fearing that she would bleed more. "Don't worry about anything. Just hold onto the rope ladder. Slowly climb up until you get into the cabin, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As he spoke, he picked her up in his arms and headed for the nearest rope ladder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace leaned against Jason's chest. His upper body was currently naked. The wind on the rooftop was especially cold, and the skin on his chest was freezing.</p></div>
