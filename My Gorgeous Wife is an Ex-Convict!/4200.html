        <h1>Chapter 4198</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Tina filled the paper with various names she had chosen for the baby in her belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever she asked Kit to help her choose which name sounded better, Kit would always say that every name sounded good and wouldn't specifically pick a certain name. This made Tina feel like she was being brushed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you not like this child?" Tina couldn't help but ask again when she asked Kit to help pick a name but received the same answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that be?" Kit said, "Tina, I love this child. I can give everything for you and this child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because this child is her child!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loves her, so he's willing to give everything to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it seems like you don't want to choose a name for the baby," Tina complained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because I really think every name is good," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" she looked at him suspiciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really." he raised his hand as if taking an oath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, I'll choose on my own." she finally believed his words, "By the way, when can we install the internet at home? I want to go online." Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit became nervous, he intentionally didn't install the internet and didn't give her a cellphone, because he was afraid she would go online and possibly find out about her origins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can install the internet after you give birth. Besides, you don't really need the internet right now. If you want to go online, you can use my cellphone." Kit said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, when Tina uses his cellphone, he would always be beside her, paying special attention to prevent her from finding news about the Stephenson family and the Hunter family searching for her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, it's been almost half a year since she disappeared into the water, so the news coverage has decreased. Unless someone specifically searches, they generally won't find news about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright." Tina nodded, "Then I want to go shopping at the mall, to prepare some things for childbirth and things for the baby."</span></p></div>
