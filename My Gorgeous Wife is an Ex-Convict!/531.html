        <h1>Chapter 530</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer seemed to have been struck by lightning as she realized she had acted like a clown that night. She had thought that she was making fun of Grace, but in actual truth, all she had done was make fun out of herself and let everyone see her as a joke!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was rejected entry at Brian's private mansion as the servant said to her, "Please leave, Miss Cummins. Sir told me that he doesn&rsquo;t want to see anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you tell him it was me?" Evelyn asked hurriedly. She had not seen much of Brian ever since the banquet. Additionally, he had turned her down every time she tried to reach him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she had come straight to his house but was refused entry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart said he won't see 'anyone'. I suppose 'anyone' includes you, Miss Cummins. Or you could call Mr. Hart and ask if he wishes to see you. If he does, I'll let you in," The servant said respectfully. Nevertheless, a hint of disdain could be seen in his eyes that were slightly lowered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was one of the many women he had seen in his life. None of the crown prince's girlfriends had not been eager to get a hold of his heart. However, who could get a hold of it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Miss Cummins was ambitious. However, just like her predecessors, she was unable to enter the crown prince's heart. It probably would not take long for her to retire as the crown prince's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn could only stare and gnash her teeth in hatred. Could she call Brian and get him to see her? Would she beg a servant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the mansion, Brian was in his studio, holding a pencil and drawing a portrait&ndash;a portrait of what he imagined the little girl from his memories would look like after growing up. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only after he had finished the portrait did he realize that what he had drawn was a Grace lookalike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at the portrait he had drawn and put down his pencil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had to be mad! He had thought of the little girl from his childhood while drawing but ended up drawing Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His delusion had to be caused by the many similarities Grace and that little girl shared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His delusion led him to take Grace too seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the past few days, as soon as he closed his eyes, a flashback of the scene he had witnessed that day would flash across his mind. It was the scene of Jason kissing Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she... finally with Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not struggle nor resist. She was so willing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian felt as if something precious of his had been lost, broken... He felt the feeling spread across his body. Perhaps he had lost something forever and could no longer get back what he wanted...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's fingers gently touched the portrait in front of him. When had the portrait&rsquo;s face become etched in his mind?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he thought about Jason kissing her, the uncomfortable feeling he felt was probably called&hellip; jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes gradually became misty. Then, he could not help but lean over, letting his lips... kiss the lips in the portrait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he crazy, spellbound... or&hellip; yearning for something that he desperately wanted until he was now almost beyond control?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The answer seemed unsolvable to him.</p></div>
