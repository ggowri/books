        <h1>Chapter 2818</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The family of three walked in the other direction. It was such a sweet scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller watched them in a daze. Her father also used to give her a ride on his shoulders like that when she was a child. She felt so tall every single time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a small fish swam past Valda Theller's feet. Valda Theller unconsciously leaned down to catch it, but she did not expect herself to lose her footing and fall forward. She was about to plunge into the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a strong arm wrapped around her waist and lifted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Brian's panicked voice rang above Valda Theller's head. "What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze and turned her head to see Brian's pale face. "I... I just wanted to... catch the fish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Catch the fish?" He froze slightly before looking down to see some small fish swimming in the stream. Then, he looked around to see others leaning forward to catch the small fish, and realization flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was only catching fish, yet he thought she was going to...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "You... didn&rsquo;t think I was going to kill myself, did you? Don't worry. I won't. My parents risked their lives to keep me alive. The happier I live, the more I won't let their efforts go to waste!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. When she spoke, there was some fragility in her round eyes but also determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly got her on her feet. Suddenly, she exclaimed, "Oh, your pants and shoes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His shoes and pants were already submerged in water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing. They're just wet," Brian said indifferently. He ran over without thinking when he saw that she was about to plunge into the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that he thought about it, it felt like a physical instinct at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, several children ran over playfully and bumped into Brian, causing him to tilt sideways.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Watch out!" Valda Theller shouted, instinctively trying to grab Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thump!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They both ended up falling into the stream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian was underneath while Valda Theller was on top. The stream was shallow, but it was enough to drown a person if they fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was underneath with Valda Theller on top of him. Valda Theller was not submerged much in the water, but Brian was entirely submerged in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian!" Valda Theller hurriedly shouted and got down from him. She tried to pull him up so that he would not suffocate from being submerged in the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a splash, he sat up. His body and head were completely wet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you? Are you okay?" Valda Theller asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian coughed twice, raised his hand to run it through his wet hair, and wiped the water off his face. "I'm okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Aware of their mishap, the children who bumped into him stood cowering to one side while their parents rushed over to apologize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry. We're so sorry!" they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s alright." Brian got up and turned around to say to Valda Theller, "Let's go ashore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she replied, and they went ashore.</p></div>
