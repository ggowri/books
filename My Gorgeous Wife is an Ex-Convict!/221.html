        <h1>Chapter 220</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Obviously, it was caused by all the groveling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Seriously, you... You knelt because they asked you to?" He was inexplicably angry all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Or what? Reject them? If I refuse, I will not get any money for being an extra today," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He choked. He knew that extras were the most vulnerable group in a film crew. They did not have any bargaining power when choosing their jobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How much money do you get a day as an extra?" His voice was muffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"80 dollars a day. Because there's a kneeling scene today, they added 50 dollars. For demonstrating the correct way to kneel and grovel, they&rsquo;ll give me another 200 dollars," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glared at her. His thoughts were stirring in his head. In other words, she repeatedly knelt and groveled for only 330 dollars?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did this woman not know how to protect herself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have a problem with Evelyn?" He asked because he could see that she was making it difficult for her on purpose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one in the film crew dared to say anything. This was natural. Extras were never taken seriously. The film crew was full of clever people, so no one was going to offend Evelyn for an extra.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because... the man behind Evelyn was him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking about this, Brian felt as if his chest was clogged. It made him feel suffocated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's my half-sister. As for whether there is a problem, there is, I guess. She has always felt that my imprisonment had ruined her future," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she did not say this, with Brian's ability, he could easily figure it out. There was no need for her to hide it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a slight surprise in his eyes. Though he roughly knew some things about Evelyn and knew that she had a sister from a different mother who did not live with her, he had not paid much attention to what her sister's name was. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he never actually cared much about Evelyn. It was only because Evelyn's lips were shaped like the girl's lips that he continued to keep her by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it never occurred to him that the woman in front of him and Evelyn could be sisters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door of the lounge was pushed open. Evelyn, whom they had been talking about just minutes ago, entered. She looked very pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn looked at Grace who had gauze wrapped around her hand. She then looked at Brian who had his eyebrows furrowed together. He was staring at her disapprovingly. She quickly snuggled up to Brian, pretending to be guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, thank you for taking care of my sister and letting Dr. Kwan check on her. I happened to meet Dr. Kwan when I was on my way here just now. I was relieved when he said her injury is nothing serious." Then, Evelyn turned to Grace and said, "I'm so sorry, Sis. I didn't hold the hand stove well, making it fall on your hand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace calmly looked at her half-sister whom she had once treated with sincerity. She had even wanted to pave the way for her sister's acting career because she thought that they were family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a car accident made her realize that she was just imagining things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then again, she did have an idea about how Evelyn was able to go from being a C-list actress to the second female lead of a big-budget film. Even the director had to go along with her demanding requests.</p></div>
