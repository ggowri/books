        <h1>Chapter 1729</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What exactly happened yesterday?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay and I were supposed to send you home yesterday, but you insisted on calling Anthony Sherman. But you ended up calling Hadwin Stephenson instead. So, uh&hellip; After he came, he said he would send you home.&rdquo; Grace told Lina about what had happened in the private room yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina got even more speechless as she listened... 'How... embarrassing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I.. was the one who called Hadwin Stephenson! I... also hugged Hadwin Stephenson in front of others and... seemed to have flirted with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Sure enough, I get into trouble every time I drink! Every time I run into Hadwin Stephenson after drinking, I'd force myself upon him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Of course, since I was the one who forced myself upon him, that means he&rsquo;s the victim!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, are you okay? Did Hadwin Stephenson send you home safely yesterday?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could only mumble, "I'm fine. I'll talk to you later." With that said, she hurriedly ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, Lina called home. It was her mother who answered the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, to Lina's surprise, she did not get an earful from her mother. "Mom&hellip; I-I didn't come home last night because..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know why. Your colleague called, saying the design office had an urgent assignment and they tasked you to produce the blueprints. Are you done with the assignment? Did you sleep in the office? Or are you coming home in the morning to catch up on sleep?" Mrs. Sweeney asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina hurriedly said, "Uh&hellip; I did get some sleep. I&hellip; won&rsquo;t be going home yet. I still have something to do in the office. I'll go home after work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was relieved after the phone call with her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her family was not suspicious that she did not go home last night. 'But... colleague?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Hadwin Stephenson probably had someone pose as my colleague and made that phone call.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina packed up her things with mixed feelings. When she walked downstairs, she saw Hadwin Stephenson sitting at the dining table as he looked at her. "Come have breakfast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "No thanks. I... I'm going to work. And where are the clothes that I wore yesterday?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I had someone wash them," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then... please deliver them to me after. Just deliver them to my house. I'll send over the clothes I'm wearing after I wash them," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her voice grew quieter under his gaze, and his eyes turned cold when she finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? After what you did to me last night, you can't wait to get away from me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I..." She bit her lip and said with a look of embarrassment, "It was... an accident last night. I was drunk, and I have no idea what I did. Well... Men don't have much to lose, right? Let's just pretend nothing happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His face seemed to be covered with a layer of gloom. "Nothing happened? Okay. Good for you, Lina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He got up and approached her. "How do you know I've got nothing to lose? Do you know what it feels like to give someone hope only to take it back from them afterward?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She froze and awkwardly stumbled backward as he continued to move closer and closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She lost her balance and fell to the floor.</p></div>
