        <h1>Chapter 3370</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lonny and Laura also looked dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lonny was shocked and felt that something seemed to be exceeding his expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Vice President Gary, I..." Lonny took a step forward, intending to exchange a few words with Vice President Gary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Vice President Gary walked straight past him, without even looking at him, and went straight to Chandler. "Mr. Hunter, I'm sorry for the neglect. Please forgive me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, everyone was dumbfounded again, even the security guards who were called over by the staff looked confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, those security guards were also relieved that they had not forcibly removed the person from the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, they would have offended someone like Vice President Gary, who even had to address someone as "young master" with respect!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler looked at Vice President Gary in front of him, his facial expression remained unchanged, and he simply explained what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Vice President Gary immediately said, "This seal was not reserved. If you like it, Mr. Hunter, feel free to take it. And if there is anything else in this exhibition that catches your eye, please feel free to take that as well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as these words were spoken, everyone was immediately shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lonny spoke urgently and authentically, "Vice President Gary, don't you recognize me? I am the butler of the Mond family. Our master is the head of the Mond Group..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Lonny was interrupted by Vice President Gary before he could finish speaking. "Listen here, Lonny. I don't care who you are or who your family is. I never made an appointment for you to use this seal, so it doesn't belong to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, Vice President Gary took the seal directly from the staff's hand and handed it over to Chandler, saying, "Since Mr. Hunter was the first to see this seal and has confirmed his intention to buy it, it should naturally be given to Mr. Hunter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler took over and instructed his subordinates to pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vice President Gary wanted to stop him, but Chandler said, "The money has to be paid, I bought it for Tina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vice President Gary's attention then shifted to Tina, who was standing next to Chandler. Chandler handed over the set of stamps to Tina, and she immediately smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, this girl seems to like this set of stamps!" Vice President Gary thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, do you want to keep shopping?" Chandler asked Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina shook her head. Although she was quite happy to have received this set of stamps, she no longer felt like exploring the exhibition hall. "I'm hungry and I want to eat something," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's go," said Chandler as he took Tina's hand and walked towards the outside of the exhibition hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Laura spoke out in anger, "Tina, what's with your attitude? My parents said that you're just a child bride. Do you even know what that means? It means your parents sold you! Your parents don't even want you anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she said this, Lonny's face suddenly changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, there are some things that can be said at home without consequence, but once said outside, one must be especially careful. This is particularly true in the current situation. Lonny understands that Mr. Hunter is not an ordinary person, and his background is even more powerful than the Mond family. This is why Vice President Gary completely ignores the Mond family and only seeks to please Mr. Hunter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina stopped in her tracks and turned to glare at Laura. "You're lying. My parents didn't sell me off as a child bride!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're the one! You're the one!" exclaimed Laura. "If you don't believe me, just ask your big brother here! Ask him if you're not his stepdaughter..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Laura suddenly stopped speaking because Chandler's gaze was coldly fixed on her, causing a feeling of fear to well up in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Make her even more scared than getting caught cheating on an exam!</p></div>
