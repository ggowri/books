        <h1>Chapter 3323</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, you're almost at your due date, right?" Grace said to Valda on the other end of the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, in a week it will be the due date. These days, I'm on high alert at all times," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I wish you all the best and please let me know when you give birth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, definitely," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the call ended, Valda saw Brian walking down from upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As her due date was approaching, he stopped going to the office three days ago and brought all his work home to handle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if there are any meetings to discuss, they are all video conferences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who were you on the phone with just now?" Brian walked over to Valda and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Talking about the Abbott family with Grace," Valda said. "It feels like life is so unpredictable. People who were lively and energetic before suddenly disappear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's eyes darkened slightly, "Yes, life is unpredictable." When she fell into the river while trying to save Grace's child, he couldn't help but feel the same way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, everything was fine. Before, she was still smiling at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the blink of an eye, she disappeared from his sight, leaving nothing behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, God returned her to him! Otherwise...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Brian leaned down, opened his arms, and hugged Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just because Valda was pregnant, he hugged her cautiously, being careful not to hold her too tightly for fear of pressing on her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Valda asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although they were discussing the Abbott family, he suddenly hugged her. This embrace, for some reason, made her feel both sweet and fragile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't let anything happen to you, even if everything else is unpredictable," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda suddenly understood what was going on. He was probably thinking about the incident when she fell into the water years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda lifted her hands and hugged Brian, saying "Mmm, I know you won't let anything happen to me, and I won't let anything happen to myself either. Brian, we and our child will be just fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And his response was to gently kiss her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Valda lay in bed while Brian held a children's book and read stories from it, claiming it was for prenatal education.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to Hadwin, reading more fairy tales during pregnancy can help cultivate a child's cultural literacy, and in the future, the child may be more interested in knowledge and culture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when Brian looked at Hadwin and Lina's daughter, he didn't think that the little one was interested in knowledge or culture. As for cultural refinement, he couldn't see any signs of it at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It is said that in kindergarten, Shengsheng was a little bully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The child named Chandler seems to enjoy reading and is said to have skipped a grade in school. Despite being young, he has a strong knowledge base.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina often sighs and says, "That's someone else's child."</p></div>
