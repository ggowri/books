        <h1>Chapter 3979</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you guys doing here?" A colleague approached Nancy and Irene, who were in a standoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing." Nancy let go of Irene's hand and said, "I was just discussing some things with her, and now we're done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Nancy left directly, leaving Irene standing there, staring fiercely at her back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, Nancy submitted her resignation letter and did some work handover with her colleagues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resignation went smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Nancy finished the resignation procedures and left the hotel, she thought she would feel relieved, but her heart seemed to be filled with more regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving here, she would never see Mick again, would </span><span>she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't even have a chance encounter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would she have a chance to see him again in the rest of her life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he remember her in the long years to come?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or...would he continue to hate her forever?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, her heart ached again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of pain was already familiar to her, because these days she often experienced this kind of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy!" A voice sounded at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked up and found that the person calling her was Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you..." She didn't expect to meet Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to find you on purpose." Jasper approached and smiled slightly. "Do you have time to chat with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy hesitated for a moment and slowly agreed, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them then went to a coffee shop near the hotel, and Jasper ordered two cups of coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aroma of coffee gradually relaxed Nancy's tense nerves because she saw Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to talk to me about?" Nancy asked, although she already had some guesses in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened between you and my older brother?" Jasper asked directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy thought to herself, biting her lip. There were some things she needed to gather courage to say to Mick's own sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they first met, Jasper was very friendly to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if she said what she needed to say next, would he still be friendly to her? Or would he look at her like Mick did, cold and disgusted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Nancy's body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your older brother and I have separated," Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you break up?" Jasper asked. Over the past month, his brother had become even more silent than before. She had even heard that his brother had become someone everyone was afraid of in the company, and everyone was afraid of accidentally angering him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy smiled bitterly, "My relationship with him...was never really a relationship. We just spent time together, so we can't really call it a breakup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why did you separate?" Jasper asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy took a deep breath and said directly, "Because I used him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Used him?" Jasper was stunned. He clearly didn't expect that to be the answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, because I used your brother to avenge me. From the beginning, I used his kindness towards me, deliberately getting close to him, just because I couldn't use my own abilities to get Clarissa, who pushed my mother off the balcony, to go to jail. So I needed your brother to help me do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy spoke calmly, only she knew how nervous she was when she said these words.</span></p></div>
