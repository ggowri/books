        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Tina's memory..." Harley was very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if there is forceful stimulation, there are risks and potential damage to the brain's nerves. So, it's not a very good method," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's eyes dimmed. "Even if someone from the Quentin family intervenes, there would still be risks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the Quentin family's medical skills are excellent, it doesn't mean there is no risk. Medicine is never a hundred percent certain," Lornell replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just hope Tina can regain her memory. If she does, maybe there's still hope for her marriage with Chandler," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did you become so close to Tina?" Lornell asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Tina and Harley had a 5-year age difference, they didn't often play together when they were younger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they frequently had family gatherings due to the close relationships between their families, Harley mostly played with Trista, who was closer in age, and Jasmine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have a good relationship with Tina too. Plus, if it wasn't for Tina's engagement to Chandler, which piqued your curiosity, we wouldn't have gotten engaged," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This matter was something she accidentally overheard adults discussing when she grew up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after hearing it, she felt a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, otherwise why would he have proposed to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she was just a 7-year-old child, and he was only 3. Their first meeting couldn't even be called harmonious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he voluntarily proposed to her, partly out of compassion, wanting to save her, and partly out of curiosity about what it feels like to be engaged to someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a child's curiosity that bound the fate of the two of them together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell didn't deny it, which made Harley feel uncomfortable. She then gave a bitter smile. Wasn't this already clear?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they had been engaged and spent so many years together, he actually didn't have any feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, where are we going?" Harley asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we didn't make plans for lunch, let's say hello in the evening," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until half an hour later that Harley finally understood what Lornell meant by that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the medical students in front of her, Harley felt very embarrassed and unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Lornell confidently introduced everyone, "This is my fianc&eacute;e, Harley. These people are my classmates from medical school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell began to introduce each of those classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of classmates stared at Harley in astonishment. After a while, someone asked, "Lornell, you have a fianc&eacute;e?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Lornell replied flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did that happen?" someone else asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's something from our childhood, our engagement, it was decided when we were young," said Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it's like an arranged marriage by parents? What era is this? How can they casually arrange an engagement like that?" a voice rang out, it was the school beauty that Harley saw being teased at noon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was the one most affected by Lornell's words just now.</span></p></div>
