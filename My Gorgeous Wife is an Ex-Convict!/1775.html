        <h1>Chapter 1773</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian went back to the car. He smiled ruefully as he looked out the window to look at the night sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'So that's what happened. Grace chose to fall into the sea... for Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace loves Jason so much... that she would sacrifice her own life and the lives of her three children for Jason. She took the risk to keep the three triplets in her belly, which shows just how much she loves them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But... she loves Jason more!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason woke up. Grace and Jason went to the hospital where the little one was admitted and saw Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow was also in the ward. She was the only member of the He family who Jason allowed to visit Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After the other members of the He family found out that Mason was the Reed family's lost child, they all regretted it. They regretted not treating Mason well when he was with the He family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, after hearing the news that Mason had been found, they immediately rushed to the hospital. Unfortunately, they were blocked outside the hospital's inpatient building. They could not even enter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had met the He family when she entered the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although the He family was full of smiles and wanted to get close to her, Grace did not bother to pay them any attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow was feeding Mason in the ward. As he had his stomach pumped, the little one could only eat liquid food like soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow was only a seven-year-old girl, but she seemed quite skilled at feeding Mason soup. It was as if she had done it many times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason was like a docile kitten in front of his sister. He obediently opened his mouth and would lift his chin when told.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, after Grace and Jason walked into the hospital ward, the little one suddenly changed from a docile kitten to a guarded tiger. His tiny body grew tense. If he had a tail, Grace thought that the fur on the little one's tail would be standing on end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's eyes turned red when she saw that her son was looking at her as though she was an enemy. "Mason, are... you feeling better? I... I'm your mommy. I'm sorry that I haven't been by your side and made you suffer so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason looked at Grace coldly. "I don't need a mommy. I just need Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason frowned and stood in front of Mason. "You're five years old and have your own ideas. I don't know what's going on in your head, but if you dare hurt your mommy's heart, I won't treat you kindly even if you are our son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace quickly grabbed Jason and said, "Don't treat him like that. Even if he doesn't acknowledge me, it's because I haven't been by his side. I've done him wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason was still guarded as if Jason's threat and Grace's tears meant nothing to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two people in front of him were just enemies he had to face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not until Veronica Barlow spoke up that the look in the little one's eyes changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mason, didn't I tell you? aunt Cummins and Uncle Reed are your daddy and mommy. aunt Cummins likes you very much. You shouldn't treat her like this. Your mommy and daddy desperately tried to save you when you were kidnapped," said Veronica Barlow.</p></div>
