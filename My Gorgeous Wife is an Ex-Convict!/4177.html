        <h1>Chapter 4175 Leaving Clues</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After ending the call, Tina's face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There was also a makeup artist in the room with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, the makeup artist didn't hear the content of her recent conversation, so she didn't know what had happened. She just noticed that Tina's expression was off and asked with concern, "Miss Stephenson, are you okay? Feeling unwell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's nothing." Tina glanced around the room. Did Mr. Perkins install any surveillance or listening devices here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She couldn't take risks, especially when the cost of taking risks was Eugenia's life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she couldn't just go alone to save Eugenia either. That might put both of them in danger. Regardless, she had to get this information out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After thinking for a moment, Tina said to the makeup artist, "I'm feeling a bit nervous. Could you please go and get me a glass of EATMOON? It's a new cocktail, and Chandler knows it's my favorite!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay." The makeup artist agreed and left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A while later, someone knocked on the door. Tina opened it to find a stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Miss Stephenson, please come with me," the person said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina pressed her lips tightly and followed the person out of the dressing room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Obviously, the person deliberately avoided the surveillance cameras.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The people they passed by, even if they saw her in a wedding dress, wouldn't say anything more than a greeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A car, the hotel's side entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina got into the car, reassuring herself that everything would be fine. Chandler should find the clue she left behind and come looking for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Along the way, she would discreetly tear off some small shiny pieces from her wedding dress and drop them on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And when the makeup artist couldn't find her and went to tell Chandler, as long as the makeup artist mentioned the name of the cocktail she ordered, Chandler would know it was related to Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because there was no such cocktail called EATMOON!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But would Chandler be able to deduce that she got into this car based on the location where she boarded?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As long as they could identify the vehicle, they could track it through the road surveillance cameras!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "How much did Mr. Perkins pay you to do this?" Tina casually engaged in conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You don't have to worry about it, Miss Stephenson," the other party said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What if I offer you triple the price?" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Even if you offer me ten times the price, Miss Stephenson, I'm afraid I won't be able to get out of this alive," the other party stated bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina bit her lip tightly. The bribery attempt had failed. It seemed that turning someone against their own side was not as simple as she had thought!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The destination was a three-story abandoned building by the river.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina finally saw Eugenia, who was tied up like a dumpling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Are you stupid? Why did you actually come? Do you think they will let me go just because you're here? We're both going to die here!" Eugenia shouted. Mr. Perkins didn't gag Eugenia's mouth, seemingly enjoying the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although Eugenia was cursing, Tina could hear her friend's concern for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This best friend of hers, she truly hadn't made a wrong choice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Well, I may be stupid, but I can't let anything happen to you!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia had been implicated because of her, so how could she just leave Eugenia in danger like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Clap! Clap! Clap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The sound of applause rang out, and Mr. Perkins laughed, "You two really have a deep sisterly bond. I wonder what our Miss Stephenson is capable of doing for her sister!"</p></div>
