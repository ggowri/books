        <h1>Chapter 4410: Boyfriend</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though out there, not many people know about this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everyone in this circle knows about it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that Harley had stuck his neck out for Calvert, and now Harley had become Calvert's rock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when the news of their relationship broke, everyone in the circle was left utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she's the big princess of the entertainment industry. She actually fell for this Calvert, who has no family background at all, and even... became boyfriend and girlfriend?!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people were both envious and jealous of Calvert's good fortune, and naturally, there were also many who suspected that Calvert must have used some underhanded methods.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, with so many handsome men and beautiful women in the entertainment industry, why would Harley be interested in them!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, both Harley and Calvert chose to ignore these rumors and gossips. After all, in this circle, if you care about these rumors, you're bound to get depressed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to get resources for me, I want to rely on my own efforts," Calvert said seriously to Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure!" Harley responded cheerfully, "But even if I don't help you get resources, those resources will keep coming your way because you're my boyfriend. You may never know which ones you earned through your own abilities and which ones were given to you because others wanted to please you. Unless you leave the industry and switch to a field that has nothing to do with the entertainment circle."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked up, "Are you asking me to quit the industry?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback. At this moment, she suddenly had a feeling that if she really agreed, he would probably quit the circle without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shouldn't be asking me, but rather, you should be asking yourself. This is your career, your future life!" she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... she is his life!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment he entered the entertainment industry, it was because of her recommendation. It was her who made him live like a human being!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always seized every opportunity, climbing relentlessly upwards, all because of her. He just wanted to stand by her side, to be more worthy of her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what else I could do if I leave this circle." Over the past couple of years, he's become increasingly adept at navigating this world. "What I want is to be able to accompany you on a longer journey. If you're destined to be in this circle, then I want to stay in it too. If I can't distinguish which resources I've earned through my own abilities and which ones you've brought to me, that's okay. I'll strive to do better, so good that maybe one day, I might be able to help you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to be forever on the receiving end of her help. He also hoped that he could be of use to her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley laughed, patting Calvert on the shoulder, "You got this, boyfriend!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was taken aback for a moment, a feeling of Harley washed over him. Boyfriend... yes, he was now her boyfriend!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley doesn't want her relationship to be public, attracting public attention, especially now that she's still dating Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those gossip journalists, naturally, after hearing such rumors, tactfully avoided the scandal involving Harley and Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, you don't want to mess with the Hart family. Those journalists who have crossed the Hart family in the past didn't end up well!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Calvert is at work, Harley often drops by for a visit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like this fashion show, Calvert is on the runway, while Harley is in the audience, watching Calvert strut his stuff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she saw him appear, her gaze seemed to be unable to move away from him!</span></p></div>
