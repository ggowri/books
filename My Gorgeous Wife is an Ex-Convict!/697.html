        <h1>Chapter 696</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what was going on with Stella then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it turned out that her dreams were not related to memory loss but she might have dreamed it because she heard Stella talk about it as a child, then she was merely thinking too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she told Jason, it would only rouse his suspicions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least... She would only tell him when everything was settled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I find you an expert?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The experts he spoke of were of course top-notch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've made the appointment for tomorrow, so no thanks for now. Let's talk about it after I consult the doctor," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go with you tomorrow," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. It's not a holiday tomorrow. I can go by myself. I'm just checking out my headache. You don't need to accompany me," Grace said hurriedly. After all, she was going to the doctor tomorrow to ask about her dreams, so it would be rather inconvenient if he was there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glistened a little, and his long lashes dropped slightly to hide the look in his eyes. "Be careful, then. I'll ask the driver to take you there tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," she answered softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Grace arrived at the hospital's outpatient clinic at the appointed time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When facing the doctor, she talked about her symptoms one by one, including her dreams and the occasional headache which was accompanied by some broken images.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not see what the images were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After listening, Dr. Guzman pondered for a moment and said, "It could be that the memory is impaired and because of some stimulus, it has started to recover locally."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked, vaguely recalling that she started having these dreams and headaches when Brian told her about his childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only at that time, she thought she had the dream because she was thinking about it all day and night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be that what Brian said was... A stimulus to me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Has your family ever mentioned that you've lost some of your memory?" asked Dr. Guzman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. At least her father and stepmother had not mentioned this before, and as for Grandma... Now that Grandma was dead, she could not ask even if she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, memory loss is one possibility, but it could also be something else. If you want to know if it's amnesia or fantasy, you can find out by hypnosis," said Dr. Guzman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hypnosis?" Grace did not expect the doctor to say the same thing as Lina. "Can hypnosis confirm whether it's amnesia?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but it needs to be done by an experienced psychiatrist. An experienced psychologist can make a judgment based on your reaction. If you need anything, I can refer you to a psychologist. Of course, you can decide whether to go or not," replied Dr. Guzman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Dr. Guzman spoke, he took a note and wrote the psychiatrist's name as well as contact information on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took it and said thank you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Coming out of the outpatient clinic, Grace was a little preoccupied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Hypnosis&hellip;' Hypnosis was the quickest way to determine whether the events in her dream were imaginary or part of a lost memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had set her heart on finding out what the dream was all about.</p></div>
