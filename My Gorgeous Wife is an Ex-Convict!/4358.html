        <h1>Chapter 4356 A Firm Stance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback, then realized that the middle-aged man beating up Calvert at this moment was not the same one he had seen last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Harley could react, the middle-aged man had already let go of Calvert and rushed up to Harley: "You're the one who was with my son today, right? Driving such a nice car, you must be pretty wealthy. My son spent so much time with you today, shouldn't you show some appreciation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son?" Harley looked at the middle-aged man in front of him. Could this man be Calvert's father?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was brimming with embarrassment at this moment. He quickly stepped in front of his father, "Dad, it's not what you think. She's just a classmate who kindly offered to bring me home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just classmates?" Calvert's dad didn't believe his son's words, "Well, this classmate of yours seems to be quite nice to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, he smirked with a hint of malice and said, "So, this friend here, you're not short of money, right? My family is going through some tough times right now. Could you lend us some money to help us get through this? My health isn't good, I'm suffering from many illnesses, and I can't even afford to go to the hospital now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't listen to what my dad is saying, just go!" Right now, all Calvert wants is for Harley to leave as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe this way, his embarrassment would be lessened a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But would Calvert's dad just let Harley walk away like that? He immediately slapped Calvert hard across the face. "What? You don't even care about your own father's life or death? I knew it, you're just like your mother, both of you heartless. If I'd known this would happen, I should've thrown you out when your mother left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's dad was cursing while simultaneously raising his hand to hit Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Harley commanded, "If you hit him again, you won't get a penny from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's dad suddenly stopped in his tracks, "This friend here is indeed a kind soul. I don't need much, just a hundred thousand dollars would do, so I can get a proper medical check-up. I suppose a hundred thousand dollars isn't much to you, right? Besides, my son's face is worth quite a bit, isn't it? Ever since he was a kid, there have been quite a few girls chasing after him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of disgust crossed Harley's eyes. This kind of father treats his son like a mere commodity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, about this money..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's father shamelessly extended his hand towards Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley simply said coldly, "Take him to the hospital for a check-up. If he's sick, make sure he gets proper treatment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Calvert's father was standing there, completely baffled, suddenly two tall figures emerged from the shadows nearby. They flanked him, one on each side, effectively trapping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you people? Let me go! Let me go!" Calvert's father was shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley said, "They are my family's bodyguards. Since you mentioned earlier that you're sick but can't afford treatment, you should go to the hospital for a check-up. Whatever treatment you need, the hospital will provide it. You don't need to worry about the medical expenses. However, I don't want you to randomly attack Calvert anymore. If you do, you might end up staying in the hospital for a long time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Calvert's father felt a sense of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was just looking at a young girl, he couldn't help but feel scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Calvert's father was taken away by the bodyguards. Harley turned to Calvert and said, "I think I should take you home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert hung his head low, almost afraid to look up at Harley. After a long while, he finally managed to choke out, "I'm sorry."</span></p></div>
