        <h1>Chapter 459</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." She was speechless. No one had ever tasted other people's medicine just to know how bitter it was. Besides, it was medicine for women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though there was only a little bit left and it would not hurt him, but... Uh, he was a little careless in doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you have a piece of candy to keep the bitterness down?" she asked while still sucking on the candy in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," he answered. However, instead of taking the candy on the plate, he leaned over to her. His hand grabbed the back of her head while his handsome face leaned close to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." She had just opened her mouth when his kiss fell on her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, she could feel him prying his way inside her mouth. It was as if he wanted to rob her of everything...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His kiss was lingering and domineering, making her almost breathless. The bitterness was mixed with sweetness, and it was evident by the end of the kiss that she could not tell what was the taste in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was over, she looked at him, blushing. His large hand was still on the back of her head. She could not look away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's sweet." His extremely beautiful and amorous eyes gazed at her while his thin lips whispered these words as if they were teasing her heart. His eyes glistened with longing for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt that her mind was in turmoil at that moment. It was as if she had been bewitched by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got on the phone with her grandmother, and after setting the time and date she would visit her, she decided to buy something for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her grandmother had been discharged from the hospital. According to her, since her health was the same regardless if she was hospitalized or not, she might as well save a few bucks and rest at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that her grandmother was worried about spending too much money on the hospital bills. Although her grandmother could take her medicine on time, the nurses at the hospital would take good care of her, and thus, it would be better for her health. However, her first uncle, second uncle, and third aunt would not be pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Plus, could her grandmother be well taken care of at home?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She also learned from the doctor about her grandmother's sickness. She knew that she needed a long rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll just wait and see what happens after I meet Grandma,' thought Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had already gone to work. Grace woke up to find a bank card on her bedside table with a note saying, &lsquo;Keep it on you and use it if you need anything.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His simple and strong handwriting was pleasing to the eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had been in the past, Grace would have given the bank card back to Jason, but she thought differently now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reason she would keep the card was not because of how much money it had. It was because she knew he was showing concern for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she still believed that a woman needed to be independent and strong without relying on others easily, but... Once in a while, when she was tired, she still wished she could have someone to lean on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was probably that someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing her breakfast and medicine, Grace was going to buy a gift for her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where do you want to go, Miss Cummins? I'll ask the driver to take you," said the butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's fine, I'll just take the bus," said Grace, not wanting to bother the driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let the driver take you, or Young Master Reed will blame me for not taking good care of you," said the butler.</p></div>
