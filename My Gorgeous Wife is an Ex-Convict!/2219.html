        <h1>Chapter 2217</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla headed outside as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Mr. Lambert stopped Kyla. "Where are you going? Martin Weiss isn't even here yet but you're thinking of leaving?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smelled the stench of alcohol rushing up her nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid hurriedly pulled Mr. Lambert and said, "Hey, Mr. Lamber. You must&rsquo;ve had too much to drink. Why bother a woman?" Then, he said to Kyla with a smile, "Why don't you just call Mr. Weiss out for a meal? We mean no harm. We're all businessmen. And you have much to gain if we manage to do any business with Mr. Weiss. Won't it be the best of both worlds? Don't you think so, Miss Corbyn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid might look like he was sticking up for Kyla, but his purpose was still to get Kyla to call Martin Weiss out. They were playing bad cop, good cop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "My relationship with Martin Weiss isn't what you think it is. If you wish to do business with the Weiss family, you may look for him at his company. You don't have to do it in such an indirect way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Kyla was about to leave again, Mr. Lambert grabbed her. "It seems that you're ungrateful! Do you really think you're carrying a treasure? Do you believe that I can make you lose your baby today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was shocked, while Jacqueline Bowman hurriedly said, "Kyla, why... Why don't you ask Martin Weiss to come over? It's just a meal. Why make such a fuss? Mr. Lambert's family background isn't simple. You don't want to offend him! Oh, I just wanted to treat you to a meal out of kindness. Who knew this would happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked down at her belly. She had walked into a meal with people full of ulterior motives. These people would not let her go unless Martin Weiss came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert was obviously a bully. He was used to having things his way. There was no telling what people like that were capable of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not risk the safety of the baby she was carrying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Martin Weiss... Kyla only tasted bitterness in her mouth. She had just told Martin Weiss yesterday not to appear in front of her again, but she had to reach out to him today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking out the cell phone in her bag, Kyla called Martin Weiss with everyone in the private room watching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla?" Martin Weiss's voice sounded on the other end of the line. He seemed a little doubtful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "It's me. I'm... having a meal with some other people, but they want to see you, so come over. The address is..." She gave him the hot pot restaurant&rsquo;s name, address, and their private room number. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other end of the line, Martin Weiss seemed to ponder for a moment before saying, "Okay, I'm coming over." With that said, he ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said to the crowd in the private room, "I've called him. He should be here in a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd instantly seemed pleased, including Mr. Lambert, who prevented Kyla from leaving earlier. He thought Kyla had realized what was good for her. "Oh, you could have done so earlier. We just want a meal with Martin Weiss and talk business. You have much to gain if we manage to seal the deal. Do you think you can marry into the Weiss family just because you're pregnant? The Weiss family will never accept a woman who has been to prison unless they want to make a fool of themselves!"</p></div>
