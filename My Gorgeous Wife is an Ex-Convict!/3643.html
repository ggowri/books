        <h1>Chapter 3641</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When William pushed open the door, Camelia was just about to pour a cup of warm water. As soon as she saw William, she was startled, and even the cup in her hand almost slipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, you... you're here?" Camelia's face showed surprise and joy. She quickly put down the cup and walked up to him, "Your grandfather just fell asleep. I'll wake him up right away. He'll be so happy to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need." William said coldly, "Since he's already asleep, let him sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then... why don't you sit for a moment? I'll pour you a cup of water." Camelia hurriedly offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, thank you." William refused. Grace stood still, showing no intention of sitting down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then... would you like something to eat or drink? I can go to the convenience store on the first floor of the hospital. It's still open." Camelia suggested again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to eat or drink anything." William said expressionlessly, "I came here today just to ask why you came to Emerald City. Isn't it better to stay in Deer Capital? Or is it because you want something from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We... we came to Emerald City just to see you, we really don't have any other intentions. Your grandfather's health is not good, so we missed you even more. We happened to meet a classmate of yours from school in Deer Capital, and he said you're now studying at Stanford </span><span>University, so we came here." Camelia explained, "We really didn't expect that our visit would cause you so much trouble. Your grandfather blames himself too, that's why he had a relapse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Camelia spoke, she sobbed. At this moment, she was no longer the arrogant and wealthy lady from the past, but a helpless and heartbroken old woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was no change on William's face. "Guilt? Then back when Lily died and left me all alone, you knew I would be sent to the welfare home, but you didn't want to come pick me up. Did you feel guilty back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camelia was at a loss for words. "At that time, our living conditions were not good, we couldn't afford to raise you, so... so we thought that you going to the welfare home might be better for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you just ignored me like that, and didn't even come to see me once," said William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camelia felt guilty, opened her mouth, but ultimately didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or maybe you were afraid of being implicated? Afraid that even if you came to see me once, the Reed family would retaliate against you? So you simply didn't care about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said that, Camelia's expression changed to one of guilt and unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, even if she didn't say anything, William knew that he had guessed right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled suddenly, "You were afraid back then, but now you're not afraid anymore. Is it because you know that my relationship with the Reed family is good, and that the Reed family won't hold you accountable? So if I hadn't been adopted by the Reed family for a period of time back then, and I was still just an orphan today, would you still dare to appear in front of me and admit that you are my grandparents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, we were wrong to you back then. These years, we have also been thinking about you, knowing that you're doing well, and we didn't dare to disturb you. If it wasn't... for your grandfather's deteriorating health these years, we missed you so much and wanted to see you, to have a few words with you," Camelia murmured, "William, please forgive us. We're not asking for anything, we just hope you can forgive us so that the two of us old folks can die in peace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But William's face remained cold. "Why do you think I should forgive you? You never raised me for a day, and for so many years, you didn't care about me. Today, you come asking for my forgiveness. Don't you find that ridiculous?"</span></p></div>
