        <h1>Chapter 3671</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like that girl from earlier?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not really," he answered nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what about the girls you went to the bar and the piano room with? Do you like them?" she continued to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not really," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't like them, why are you so intimate with them?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I have to like them to do that?" he chuckled. "Since they enjoy playing these games, I'm just indulging them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Games?" she was shocked. "Do you think this is a game?" She understood what those girls' eyes meant, being a girl herself, at least they had a good impression of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the girl he just kissed, the love in her eyes was like it was about to overflow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To me, it's just a game," he said with a very certain tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lawrence, this is not right. This kind of thing should only be done with someone you like. If you don't like those girls, you're giving them the wrong signals, which will only make them sad and upset. Or do you think it doesn't matter if you hurt others?" she glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The condemning look made him feel a sour feeling in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you not to call me Lawrence. I am Roger now. I hope Miss. Reed won't forget this!" Roger said coldly. "Also, do you think only with someone you like can you do this kind of thing? You're so naive to say that. Miss. Reed is really well-protected, still so naive like a child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Naive?" She was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it? Only naive people would say that. Those who have truly experienced the cruelty of reality would not think that way," Roger said, approaching Jasper, and suddenly stroking her cheek with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to step back in surprise, but his hand had already wrapped around her waist!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to tell you that even though I hate you and despise you now, I can still put on a smiling face to kiss you. Even if you want to sleep with me, I can satisfy you!" he said in a frivolous tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--" She glared at him, watching as his lips drew closer to hers. Suddenly, she lifted her hand and instinctively covered his lips, preventing him from kissing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips met the palm of her hand, and his gaze seemed to grow increasingly distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want you to kiss me, and I certainly don't feel any satisfaction from it," Jasper said coldly. "If you think of it so casually, it only makes me feel dirty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distant look in his eyes turned instantly cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He abruptly released his hand from her waist and pulled her hand away from his lips. "Dirty? Of course, you're the pristine Grand Princess of the Reed family, while I'm just dust in the mud. In your eyes, I'm naturally very dirty. So why do you keep appearing in front of me again and again if I'm so dirty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke with intense emotion, and Jasper pursed her lips, feeling that she had misspoken. "I...I just think you shouldn't be so casual..."</span></p></div>
