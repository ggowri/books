        <h1>Chapter 1412</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss walked up to Paisley Daniels and stared at her. "You were pregnant with Shane Currey's baby and you knew it was his, so you deliberately planned to have a miscarriage in that way to get rid of the baby in your belly while framing Kyla Corbyn at the same time. Is that so?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Compared to Paisley Daniels's agitation when she spoke, one could say Martin Weiss's voice and tone were extremely calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the calmness seemed to be an illusion and under it, there was a turbulent undercurrent. Once the illusion broke, then the turbulence would probably be catastrophic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels stiffened. Facing Martin Weiss's question, her mind almost went blank. The words she wanted to say to deny it were stuck in her throat, and she could not squeeze them out no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His piercing, cold eyes seemed to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I..." Her lips trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Or do you want me to find the doctor who operated on you and interrogate him about how old the baby in your belly was? Or do you want me to find out how much you bribed the doctor?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels knew Martin Weiss was now doubtful. He would find something if he really chose to investigate the matter. She suddenly hugged Martin Weiss and sobbed, saying, "Martin, I just love you so much. I love you. I was afraid... I was afraid you'd hate me for this, that's why... That's why I didn't tell you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm a victim too, and I didn't set Kyla Corbyn up on purpose. I really fell because she pushed me and just happened to miscarry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin, forgive me, okay? You&rsquo;ve always forgiven me no matter what I did wrong, no? We've been together for so many years... You said you'd protect me and love me all my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her sobbing voice did not cause Martin Weiss the slightest heartbreak and pity. He only felt incomparable satire at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Forgive?" Martin Weiss suddenly sneered and pushed Paisley Daniels away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels stumbled and bumped into the wall nearby. Before she could come back to her senses, Martin Weiss's hand had instantly grabbed her neck. His chilly expression suddenly turned to rage, just like the transformation of ice to fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss shouted, "Paisley Daniels, how can I ever forgive you?! Why did you lie to me? Why did you lie that you donated me the bone marrow? It wasn't you! You rejected it. Why lie and say it was you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I..." Paisley Daniels wanted to defend herself, but she was being strangled and could barely speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing this, Mr. Daniels and Mrs. Daniels began to cry out in surprise, shouting for him to stop. However, they could not get close to their daughter no matter how they tried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's heart was full of fury at the moment. If it had not been for this woman, then maybe... everything would have been different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He might have got to find out who donated him the bone marrow, and he and Kyla would have met differently!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why? Why? Is it just because you want the splendor and wealth that the Weiss family can give you?" Martin Weiss asked her again and again. He was like a beast that had lost its mind. It was as if he would tear the person before him whom he hated so deeply to pieces the next moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels's face had turned purple by now. Her tongue was sticking out. It seemed she would be strangled to death if this went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A bodyguard nearby went up to stop him at the sight of it. After all, it would be a big deal if he killed her in this hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss came to his senses and loosened his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels's legs gave way and she collapsed to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss looked down at Paisley Daniels from a commanding position. His eyes were full of solemn chills. "Paisley Daniels, I want you to live. I want you to suffer as you live a life worse than death!"</p></div>
