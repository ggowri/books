        <h1>Chapter 3062</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression changed suddenly. "Yes, it's true," he thought to himself. "I've fallen in love with Valda, but she hasn't gotten anything out of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phoebe, why do you want to seek revenge on her? You could have sought revenge on me instead!" Brian hoarsely shouted this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Phoebe was insistent, "If it weren't for Valda, you would have been with me! Who is Valda anyway? I want her to suffer more than me... But... do you think she's stupid? She's willing to give up her own life for a child that's not even hers... Why bother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian muttered, "Yeah, she...is too foolish, foolish enough to not think about herself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda is willing to sacrifice her own life to give Jasmine a chance to survive. It's not so much for Grace as it is for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was afraid that if Jasmine died, he would feel even more guilty and self-blaming, so... that's why he resorted to this method.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gave up the chance to survive to Jasmine, thinking it was the best way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she didn't know that he didn't want her to die more than he wanted to feel guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to live!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was washed away by the river, his whole world was collapsing...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phoebe, Valda didn't get nothing. She will be my wife, my beloved wife for the rest of my life!" Brian said to Phoebe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether Valda is alive or dead, she will be his wife!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe looked at Brian in disbelief, shocked. "Wife? Are you planning to marry her?! Brian, are you planning to marry a dead person?!" she exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's not dead, she will live!" he said, staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha, alive? Brian, when did you become so good at deceiving yourself?" Phoebe said. "Valda can't possibly still be alive, and... it's been three days now, past the golden 72 hours. Valda can't possibly still be alive!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice shattered the faint hope in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers suddenly gripped her neck, preventing her from speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda will live, she must... she must live." His eyes were red with tears, and he spoke these words as if he had used all his strength to say them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because...he simply cannot handle the news of possible death in his current state!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That is a burden he cannot bear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Valda seemed to have disappeared from this world. Despite the efforts of the police and the Reed, Hart, Barlow, Gregory, and Palace families of Deer Capital, no one has been able to find her for a month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the past month, Brian has been staying in Deer Capital with a piece of Valda's clothing wrapped around his wrist. He spends almost all day and night by the river where Valda was washed away by the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He has hated himself countless times, wondering why he didn't push away those people who were pressing him down. Why didn't he jump into the river earlier to find her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they didn't have enough time to swim back to the shore, at least he could hold her hand. At least, when she was swept away by the waves, she wouldn't be so lonely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda... Valda...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This name has been called countless times in his heart, but every time he calls it, it brings him deep pain! </p></div>
