        <h1>Chapter 1066</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car came to one part of Huaihai Road, and the stalls were further ahead. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss asked the driver to pull over, then he got out of the car alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver said, "Mr. Weiss, I can recommend you some stalls if you want to have late-night supper here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks." Martin Weiss refused lightly. Then, he went straight ahead to the bustling place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The food stalls looked crude to Martin Weiss. Usually, he would never come to a place like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, today... Finally, he caught sight of the thin figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even amid the crowd, he could spot her in one glance&hellip; She was still as thin as usual. Dressed in old-fashioned brown clothes and an apron, she looked quite different than when she was with him back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was cooking with her head down. The heat from the wok surged toward her still somewhat beautiful face. Her movements were so skillful that her slender arms could even toss the food out of the wok with a flip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly recalled the time she said she was going to cook for him but ended up making a mess instead. In the end, he made egg fried rice and the two made do with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she had said with a smile, "Martin, just wait and see. I'll cook up a feast for you every day! I'll become a good wife and make you fat!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After speaking, she suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you laughing?" he had asked, feeling puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "I'm just wondering what you would look like if you&rsquo;re fat. Haha, would the both of us become fat when I become a better cook?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her cooking seemed to have gotten better now, but she was also thinner than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn finished cooking the food and served it to the customer. Then, she sighed out of exhaustion and wiped away the sweat on her forehead. It could be seen that she was still faintly worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the troublemakers did not come yesterday, she was not sure if they would come today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought of setting up her stall somewhere else, but there were many more people here, so she could earn a slight profit from doing her small business here. She would earn a lot less if she moved somewhere else. Her mother was old now and would often have some minor problems. Those medical bills might only cost a few hundred at a time, but it was not a small number if she added it to the money needed to raise Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would need to earn more money because her expenses were only going to increase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a figure in a sharp suit caught her eye. Another customer. She looked up quickly, put on a smile, and said, "Sir, what do you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only started speaking when the rest of the words were stuck in her throat. The smile on her face froze instantly as her face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Kyla Corbyn lightly. "I'll have a serving of all the food you have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn only found that his voice felt... so close, yet so far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A serving&hellip; of everything? That's a lot, Mr. Weiss. You wouldn't be able to finish it if you&rsquo;re eating alone," said Kyla Corbyn as she suppressed the shock in her heart.</p></div>
