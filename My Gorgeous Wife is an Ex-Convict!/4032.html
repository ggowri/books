        <h1>Chapter 4030</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, I want to see Mick. Can you help me find him?" Nancy choked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, now!" Nancy nodded vigorously. She had too much to say to him and wanted to see him as soon as possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for her current physical condition, she would have rushed out of the ward to find him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll contact my brother for you!" Jasper said, taking out his phone and dialing Mick's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But no one answered the phone on the other end!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper thought for a moment and said, "Since my brother isn't answering the phone, I'll just go find him. No matter what, I'll bring him to see you as soon as possible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper said as he was about to leave the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stopped and said, "If...if he doesn't want to come see me, tell him I want to marry him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was caught off guard. He didn't expect to hear such a bold statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I got it!" Nancy said. If her older brother heard this...well, he would probably rush to the hospital right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Jasper left, Nancy lowered her head and whispered to her baby in her belly, "Baby, I'm sorry. Mommy loves you very much, but Mommy also loves your daddy. No matter what, I hope you both can be well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps she was too greedy, wanting everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought she could risk her life for her child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now she realized that Mick was also risking his life for their child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How should she make a choice between them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was there really no way to have both in this world?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she knew she had to make a decision!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy didn't have to wait long in the hospital room. Mick appeared in her room after only an hour!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you have Jasper say that?" Mick's voice broke the silence in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...have a lot to say to you," Nancy took a deep breath and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought we had said everything we needed to say," Mick said. "You want to keep the baby until 35 weeks, okay, I won't say anything else, and I won't stop you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was calm, as if he was talking about something ordinary, without the excitement he used to have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even his eyes were dull and lifeless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The lifelessness made Nancy feel as if the man in front of her had given up on her completely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or... has he already prepared for the worst?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So you're not going to try to persuade her anymore?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of the words he had said to Jasper before, Nancy felt a sudden pain in her chest, and the pain seemed to be getting stronger and stronger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't make myself clear. You're not unimportant to me. You're the father of my child, and... the man I love!" Nancy spoke, looking at Mick with sincerity. "But... I don't know if I'm saying this too late. Do you still believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used to only think about the child and believed that if something happened to her, he would only be sad for a while and nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of thinking had been with her throughout her pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had taken his love for granted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had thought that he didn't love her that much.</p></div>
