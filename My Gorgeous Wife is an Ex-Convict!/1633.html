        <h1>Chapter 1631</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who could help her at this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who could shield her from these questions, and who could pull her away from these reporters?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, there was suddenly a commotion in front of her. Several black cars suddenly pulled up in front of the building. A group of people quickly got down from the car and rushed over to these reporters and onlookers, separating them from Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was dumbstruck and could not figure out what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, another car drove up. A figure got out of it and walked quickly toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at the person in front of her with some astonishment... Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had appeared in front of her again, and at such a time too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Doesn't he know why the reporters are surrounding me? His presence will only make things worse!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In just the blink of an eye, Hadwin Stephenson had walked up to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina subconsciously wanted to step back, but his hand had taken hers firmly and he dragged her with him without a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina followed Hadwin Stephenson almost passively. Her mind went blank. She did not know what she was supposed to do now. All she could hear was the commotion. There were countless phones and cameras pointing at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After she got in the car, she heard Hadwin Stephenson order the driver, "Drive." Then, she instantly came back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, do you know what you're doing?" she shouted instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes." He suddenly let go of her hand and leaned back into the seat. The sunset glow outside shone into the car through the window and made his face seem a little pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could not help being stunned. 'Is he ill?' He had always seemed ill in the last few times she saw him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you feeling... uncomfortable?" she could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I'm fine," he said, taking a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina laughed at herself for overthinking it! "Please ask the driver to stop somewhere and let me down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You can't get out of the car yet," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why?" Lina frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you think you can avoid all this by getting out of the car and going home? Believe it or not, there are already a bunch of reporters waiting for you in your neighborhood," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina bit her lip. 'But being with him will only make things more controversial!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said, "I have no choice even if there are reporters. I still have to go home. You can just give them some excuses. The news will die down after a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Hadwin Stephenson was just a businessman, not a celebrity. Scandals like this would soon die down.</p></div>
