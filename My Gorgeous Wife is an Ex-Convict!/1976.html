        <h1>Chapter 1974</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little girl's expression changed, and Grace added, "In that case, you&rsquo;ll also be an ex-convict! Besides, Nelson's mom was in jail because she was wronged by bad people. But this time, you&rsquo;ll be going to jail because you made a threat, not because someone wronged you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was a nine-year-old girl, after all. Even if she was arrogant and stubborn, she was scared now. She stomped her feet and left angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace turned to look at Nelson in front of her and rubbed his head. "If I hadn't seen that, were you really going to give in to that girl?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn said nothing, but his face flushed. It was admission to Grace's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "You should never forget that I'm here for you. I know you want to protect your mom, but you're still young. So let me know if you're ever in trouble and I'll figure something out. I'll protect your mommy with you, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn's eyes reddened, and he nodded after a long pause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at the time. It was almost the time she had agreed to meet with the principal, so she said, "Alright, go back to your classroom first. I have to meet your principal for something today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn took a few steps, stopped again, and turned to Look at Grace. "aunt Cummins, don't tell my mommy about what happened today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace replied, "Okay, I got it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a while, she arrived at the principal's office, where she was warmly received by the principal. Grace knew it was because of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What? You want your second five-year-old son to study in the first grade?" the principal said with some shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I hope he can be a transfer student and attend school directly. He has a sister who isn't related to him in the first grade here, so he wants to be in the same class as her," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But he's a little younger, and his learning progress..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can let him take an entrance exam before joining the school. If he doesn't pass, the school can reject him and I'll have no problem with that," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The principal said nothing more and agreed. He also set the date for the entrance examination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After coming out of the principal's office, Grace went to the He family&rsquo;s house. Archer Barlow was not at home. Rosalind Bush was very nice to Grace now. She was attentive and served her tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knew what people like Rosalind Bush wanted. They just wanted more money or benefits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as Grace entered the He family&rsquo;s house, Mason stared at her intently. It was obvious he was staring at her to tell him about the admission.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "I've spoken to the principal. You&rsquo;re allowed to join the school, but you have to take an entrance exam to see if you can keep up with the first grade's syllabus. If you fail the exam, you can't join the school."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason agreed right away as if the exam was a piece of cake for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was not clear about her son's knowledge level. After all, Mason did not go to kindergarten like ordinary children, and logically speaking, everything he learned was what Secretary Wang had taught him before he was three years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, no one knew exactly what Secretary Wang had taught the child. Mason had never been willing to communicate with others.</p></div>
