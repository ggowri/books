        <h1>Chapter 1077</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's scared. Did I scare her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to frighten her to teach her a lesson and show her his kindness. He just wanted her to know what would happen to her if he was indeed disrespecting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he saw her in this state, he felt a terrible heaving in his chest. It was as if he was punishing himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand and gently wiped the tears from her face. "Alright, I won't force you. Not now, not ever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him blankly as though she could not believe that he would say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect herself to cry so much so suddenly. She had told herself that even if she was &lsquo;raped&rsquo;, she did not have to take it to heart. She would just think of it as sleep paralysis!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... When she was stuck in a situation she could not resist, her time in prison recurred to her. It was the same back then. It was as if no matter how much she struggled, the pain inflicted upon her would not lessen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she was not a human in their eyes but a tool to be kicked and punched and used to get benefits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The so-called human rights, dignity... had all been trampled on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were still full of tears, and she looked at him through them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark eyes met hers. "Don't worry. I&rsquo;ll keep my word!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that her tears and fear were heavy to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he could bow, kneel before her, and drop all his pride as long as she was less afraid of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hall in the Hart family's house, Mr. Hart looked at his son. He had been proud of the child ever since he was born. He hardly had to worry about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only exception was when he was kidnapped. He managed to escape on his own, get to the hospital, and call the police, but... He had been persistent in searching for someone for so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Mr. Hart's opinion, his son was great, but he was too persistent about people and things sometimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For instance, he was too persistent about the little girl who saved him when he was a child. His son had been looking for her all these years that he was almost possessed. Even those girlfriends had traces of the little girl!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Stella, who he later found, was only a vain woman. Brian did not have any extra feelings for her, so he thought he had let go of his obsession!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he did not expect was that his son, who he thought he could trust, had a conflict with the Reed family's Jason at the charity gala and even got his wrist broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard you've deployed a lot of people to find out Jason's whereabouts. Or should I say, a woman's whereabouts?" asked Mr. Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said lightly, "Dad, this is my business. Stay out of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stay out of it?" Mr. Hart frowned. "I could stay out of it back when you insisted on looking for someone. I could also stay out of it when you dated those good-for-nothing girlfriends. However, now... You're looking for this woman. Do you want Jason to break your other hand?"</p></div>
