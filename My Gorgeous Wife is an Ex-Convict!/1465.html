        <h1>Chapter 1464</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a while, the doctor finally came out of the emergency room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The doctor said, "All three babies are safe for now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How about the mother? Is the mother... okay?" Jason asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We&rsquo;ve given her some medicine and the situation is under control, but don't upset her again. If she breaks down again, I fear that the babies in her belly won&rsquo;t be able to hold on till the 35th week."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The triplets were expected to be delivered by Caesarean section on the 35th week. However, if Grace got too emotional, her water might break and she might have to deliver before then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The babies' organs might not be fully developed yet then. Even if they survived, it was likely they might suffer repercussions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I see," answered Jason, but he did not know what to do so as to not trigger her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why did Grace find out about the truth at such a time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as Jason was about to walk into the emergency room, Brian stopped him and said, "Are you just going to go in? If Grace wakes up and sees you again, aren&rsquo;t you worried that she'll get upset again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason paused and glared at Brian. "She's my wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian said unflinchingly, "So what? Whether she's your wife or not, I won't let you hurt her. You've triggered her once. Do you want to trigger her again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason trembled a little and pressed his thin lips together tightly. He finally said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace woke up, she had been transferred from the emergency room to the VIP ward. The person here was... Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla?" Grace was stunned as she had not expected Kyla Corbyn to be here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And where am I? The hospital?' She remembered hearing Jay and Brian's conversation at the top of the stairs, and...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The scenes flashed through Grace's mind like a movie, and her hands subconsciously covered her bulging belly. "My babies. Are my babies okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The babies are fine," said Kyla Corbyn said as she helped Grace ring the nurse's bell at the bedside. Moments later, the doctor and nurses came to perform some basic tests on Grace. They then told her to take a good rest and stay calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She would need to stay in the hospital for three days for observation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After the doctor and nurses left the ward, Grace asked, "Kyla, what are you doing here? Aren't you hospitalized too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "My hospitalization is nothing, and I'm about to be discharged. I got a call from Jason. He told me that something happened between you two and it made you upset. He hoped I could come and talk to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn said and could not help sighing. "With a man like him, I could hardly imagine that his voice would be so helpless and restless when he called me. He was like a desperate man with no recourse." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace clutched at the thin blanket that covered her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jason was just outside the ward when I came, but he refused to come in, saying he was afraid you wouldn't want to see him. Brian is also outside the ward. Grace, what on earth is going on?" asked Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing. I just... made a fool of myself," said Grace. She knew she could not get emotional. She had to control her emotions no matter what for the babies in her belly.</p></div>
