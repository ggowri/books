        <h1>Chapter 1323</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No big deal?" The frozen expression on Brian's face seemed to crack. It was a life-defining event for him, but it was no big deal to people like them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Say that... again!" Brian said in a cold voice, and there was some rage on his delicate but indifferent face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt was shocked, only sensing that Brian had suddenly become a different person. He was like a sword out of its sheath, ready to strike her at any moment and kill her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm just saying... it's no... No big deal. The money Stella took... Took from you should only be a small amount to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha... Haha..." Brian suddenly started laughing and swung his fist to hit Third Aunt. Patrick immediately grabbed Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, Brian. Why do you care about what people like her are saying, anyway?" said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She said it's no big deal. Hahaha... Don't you think it's funny? She said that the thing that ruined my life is no big deal&hellip;&rdquo; Brian laughed, but his laughter was choked with sobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now, now. Stop overthinking it," said Patrick in consolation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Brian stopped talking and his blank gaze was turned to one side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was confused and followed his friend's gaze, only to see Grace standing not far away. He immediately felt a thump in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted Brian to forget about Grace as soon as possible, so he had dragged Brian to the shopping mall to relax. Unfortunately, they were not only stopped by Stella's mother but also happened to run into Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick's heart was now full of regret. 'Why am I such a jinx today? Why did I choose this shopping mall?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared blankly at the figure not far away. He was scared that what he was seeing right now was just an illusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been regretting it every day. 'Why was I jealous of Grace and Chase Harper? Why was I so jealous that I didn&rsquo;t believe Grace&rsquo;s words? Why did I choose to believe in Stella instead of Grace at the time?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A series of questions appeared in his heart, leaving him with only more regrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian staggered a little toward Grace, his phoenix eyes widening as if to see her better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she real? Or maybe it's just my imagination.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was only a few steps away from Grace, a figure suddenly darted even faster to the front of her. "Grace, plead with me. Stella is your cousin. You can't possibly bear to see her in prison for the rest of her life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Third Aunt tried to get closer to Grace, Huang Qian blocked her, keeping Third Aunt away from Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Third Aunt in front of her. Among her relatives on her mother's side, no one was sincerely kind to her except for her grandmother. They would even sacrifice her for their own interests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since her grandmother's death, she no longer had anything to do with her mother's relatives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Third Aunt, I'm not going to help you. Stella has tried to hurt me more than once. You would've killed me right away if I had hurt Stella even once," said Grace.</p></div>
