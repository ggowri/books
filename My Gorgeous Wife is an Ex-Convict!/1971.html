        <h1>Chapter 1969</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers was so angry that she trembled all over. Reaching out her hand in anger, she pointed at his face. "Have... Have you forgotten who gave birth to you and raised you? Where would you be without me? Are you going to treat your own mother like this because you've grown up now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I've always known that I was just a pawn to you. Even though I was a pawn back then, it doesn't mean I'm still your pawn. But you still think of me as a pawn, so I have no choice but to do this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What... What do you mean..." Guilt flashed across Emily Flowers's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do I mean? I thought you knew it perfectly well when I came in, or should I make myself clearer?" Hadwin Stephenson snorted coldly. "I never expected my own mother to drug me. It seems you still think of me as the same child you used to push around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers said, "I'm doing this for your own good. What's wrong with the Tang family? Once the Stephenson family marries the Tang family, the Stephenson family will be L City's top richest family. What does Lina have? What can she give you apart from making you into a joke? How does someone like her deserve to be the mistress of the Stephenson family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked coldly at the person before him. "It seems you've forgotten about your origin as well as mine? You have everyone call you Mrs. Stephenson now, so why doesn't she deserve the same?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." Emily Flowers instantly blushed, raised her hand, and slapped Hadwin Stephenson in the face. "Is this how you speak to your mother?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's expression remained unchanged. He merely took the slap. "If you weren&rsquo;t my mother, do you think you'd be able to stand in front of me safe and sound after drugging me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Facing her son's cold gaze, Emily Flowers suddenly felt a tingle in her scalp. She suddenly had a feeling that her son was indeed not her pawn anymore. She even... had a feeling that if she crossed her son&rsquo;s limits again, he would have no mercy on her even if she was his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, you're going abroad whenever you come to your senses!" said Hadwin Stephenson as he got up and headed outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers suddenly shouted, "You&rsquo;re asking me to go abroad because of Lina and not because I drugged you, right? You're just retaliating against me for laying a hand on Lina, aren&rsquo;t you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson paused, then continued walking. In just a moment, he had disappeared from Emily Flowers&rsquo;s sight, leaving her in the living room alone. She started smashing things out of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson returned to the company, he saw Lina sitting in the lounge in front of his office, reading a pregnancy magazine in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin!" Lina said with a smile and waved at Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"..." Hadwin Stephenson rubbed his temple and said nothing as he headed toward his office. Lina also followed Hadwin Stephenson into the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they entered the office, Lina's hesitant look made Hadwin Stephenson raise his eyebrows slightly. "What's the matter? Do you have something to tell me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well... What did you mean by what you said when you ate the cake today?" She looked at him, her round eyes looking at him expectantly and nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson frowned slightly. "I told you this morning. Figure it out yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I'm afraid I&rsquo;ll misunderstand! Uh, won't I fail you again if I get it wrong?" explained Lina.</p></div>
