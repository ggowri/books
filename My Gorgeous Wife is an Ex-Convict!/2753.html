        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They replied with a smile, becoming friendlier with Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just now, it seemed that Young Master Hart had decided to follow his girlfriend's advice, which showed that she was important to Young Master Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the meal, Valda Theller found out that the person she ran into was an important person in tMason Swansonty government. Now, she was dining with directors or assistant directors of the government office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only seen these people on the political news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was rather like the last time she had accompanied Brian to the banquet and met people she would not normally meet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you do, Miss Theller?" someone asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, I draw comics," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Comics? That's good. There&rsquo;ll be a comic festival in tMason Swansonty soon. Miss Theller, just let me know if you're interested in attending." The speaker was someone from the cultural affairs department.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The magazine I work for has already signed up and applied for a booth," said Valda Theller, who had attended all of tMason Swansonty's comic festivals over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, do come and show your support when the time comes," the person said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled but did not take it to heart. She only thought they were being polite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When eating, Brian would help her get helpings of food that were inconvenient for her to reach. He would also help her peel the shrimps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said with a slightly red face, "I can do it myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s alright. I'll take care of it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His long fingers peeled the shrimps for her. Valda Theller even found his movements elegant. 'If Brian really wants to date, he&rsquo;ll be the perfect boyfriend,' she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone at the table watched and only smiled meaningfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the meal, Valda Theller&rsquo;s face was already flushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they left the restaurant, Brian took a box from the waiter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is this?" Valda Theller asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's the dessert you had at dinner just now. I noticed that you like it, so I asked the manager to make another one for takeaway. If you ever want to eat it again, you can call them. Their business card is in the box, and they&rsquo;ll charge the bill to me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was stunned. She did not expect Brian to pay attention to such details and notice that she liked the dessert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to thank me for? My girlfriend enjoys it. As the boyfriend, I should give indulge her," said Brian as he looked at the time. "Where else do you want to go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked. "Is this a date?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a date," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... why don't we go to the night market?" Valda Theller thought about it and said, "We're just in time for a stroll after dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wished she could be a part of his world. Similarly, she wished he could be a part of her world too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian gazed at the woman in front of him and replied, "Okay, let's go to the night market."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They got into the car, and he drove off toward the night market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller chose a pedestrian street in Emerald City, where night market stalls were set up at night.</p></div>
