        <h1>Chapter 4110</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, Tina never expected that two days later, her visit to the infertility clinic would become a hot topic on social media. Along with this, the poster she shot with Kit and the photo of her helping Kit in the alley also became trending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Rumors online started to spread that Tina and Kit had a close relationship and were secretly trying to conceive. Some even speculated that Kit was infertile, which was why Tina went to the clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In short, there were all kinds of rumors online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina felt helpless and frustrated about all the speculation. Come on, why do people have to guess like this? She's engaged to someone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Of course, some people also found out about her engagement to Chandler, and the rumors online turned into her cheating on him and Chandler being cuckolded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, the Stephenson family and Hunter quickly suppressed the rumors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was called back home to face her parents' questioning, and Chandler was also summoned to the meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin looked back and forth between his daughter and son-in-law, "What is going on here?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Um, I assure you that Kit and I have no inappropriate relationship. I'm just his fan, and helping him in the alley was just a small gesture!" Tina quickly explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin rubbed his forehead and stared at his daughter. "I'm not asking about you and Kit. I want to know why you went to the infertility clinic. What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was quick to respond. "Of course, it's to have a baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A baby? You want to have a baby now?" Hadwin stared at his daughter, and even Lina looked surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Tina replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin was taken aback. In his eyes, his daughter was still a little girl. How could she be thinking about having a baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina quickly patted her husband's chest and turned to her daughter and Chandler. "You two didn't accidentally cause a pregnancy, did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina thought to herself, "If I did get pregnant, why would I need to go to an infertility clinic, Mom?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Exactly! Lina looked at Chandler suspiciously. Could her son-in-law have some hidden issues in that area?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for why she didn't think about her own daughter, it was all due to the filter of a mother's love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler blushed slightly. He knew exactly what his future mother-in-law's gaze meant, but he couldn't explain this kind of problem!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, he was just as shocked when he saw the news trending!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he saw that Tina had gone to the infertility clinic, he even choked on his coffee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, Chandler doesn't have any problems in that area!" Tina quickly clarified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler was a bit speechless. This kind of clarification always made him feel strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How do you know he doesn't have any problems?" Hadwin's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course it's because I'm always with Chandler..." Tina's words suddenly stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh no, she let it slip!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And there was a tense atmosphere in the air, Hadwin's expression changed!</p></div>
