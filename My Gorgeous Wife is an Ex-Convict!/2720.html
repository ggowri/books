        <h1>Chapter 2718</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she needed to do now was enrich her professional knowledge in the coming years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason ended the meeting, walked up to Grace, and said, "Why were you shaking your head just now? Does your head hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I was just thinking about something," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sat down next to her, raised his hand, and gently stroked her belly, which was more than five months pregnant. Her belly looked even more obvious now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How&rsquo;s the baby today?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're fine. They kicked a few times," she said. The baby's kicks felt more obvious as she got further along in the pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go with you to the pregnancy check-up tomorrow," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But didn't you say you have an important meeting tomorrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, I've just finished it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then realized that he had pushed back tomorrow's meeting. He always tried his best to accompany her for all her pregnancy check-ups.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "You could use a little more rest. I can ask someone else to accompany me for the pregnancy check-ups."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't want to miss any pregnancy check-ups. I want to know as much as I can about you and the baby's condition," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked blankly at the man in front of her. Those charming peach blossom eyes had become filled with worry for her at some point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He... was worried about her. Since she became pregnant with this baby, his eyes were always full of unease and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I caused all this. I insisted on having the child. I&rsquo;ve made him insecure and fearful.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I'm sorry," she murmured as she took his face in her hands. Her fingertips brushed the corners of his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made you worried."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm willing to worry for you," said Jason as he rubbed his cheek against her palms. &ldquo;I want you to be safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I will." She smiled and assured him. "I'll grow old with you no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He closed his eyes gently as he smiled, enjoying the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had her by his side. Her scent, warmth, and everything made him so sentimentally attached to her. His once empty heart gradually filled up because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller returned to the film set after she recovered. However, the crew had changed greatly. The actors and actresses involved in the strike had been replaced. Even the director was replaced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people on the set were much more respectful when they met her. They called her &lsquo;Miss Theller&rsquo; or &lsquo;Comic Artist Zhong&rsquo;, making Valda Theller unused to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Does the crew know Brian is my boyfriend?" Valda Theller asked Camille Strickland quietly when she had the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I haven't said anything about it to anyone in the crew or heard them talk about it," said Camille Strickland.</p></div>
