        <h1>Chapter 1744</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace slightly pressed her lips together and said, "If I were the one suffering from that sort of headache, you'd hug me like that too, wouldn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was silent. She endured the slight tingling in her hand to caress his cheek. There was an indescribable contrast between her swollen red fingers and his handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Jay, we're husband and wife. I believe you would do anything to save me if I were in danger. Similarly, I'll save you too if you&rsquo;re in danger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyelashes quivered slightly. "Aren't you scared that I'd accidentally beat you up, or even..." He could not continue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because the very possibility of that made him nervous, even if it was a hypothetical scenario.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "I'm scared, but I'm more scared you'll sink into remorse when you wake up. Jay, promise me, don't be obsessed with the memories you lost. Let them come to you naturally, don&rsquo;t force it. Just because you're okay this time doesn't mean you'll be okay next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared at the person in front of him. Moments later, he slowly said, "Okay, I promise you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Because it won&rsquo;t happen again!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean did not expect Lily to see him again and tell him that William had been kidnapped!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kidnapped?" Sean was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, the kidnapper also sent a message. They want me to prepare a ransom of one million dollars before they&rsquo;ll let him go!" Lily showed Sean a text message on her phone as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the phone number that sent the text message was fake, so there was no way to trace it or call it back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We&rsquo;ll call the police and have them find him!" said Sean as he pulled out his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No!" Lily snatched Sean's phone from his hand. "The kidnappers said they'll kill him if we call the police! I can't take that risk. William's my only child and he's also your only child, Sean. You've never done your duty as a father. Are you going to disregard William's life now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean stiffened. The child was his flesh and blood. How could he not be anxious and worried? It was just that... "I don't have that much money, and there's no way I can get one million dollars even if I borrow from others and beg. Reporting it to the police is our only way right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily said, "It's not impossible to get one million dollars! Grace and Jason can easily fork out one million dollars!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean said with a wry smile, "Do you want me to beg them? You&rsquo;re well aware of what we did to Grace back then. Do you think they'll give us one million dollars if we knelt in front of them? You're asking for the moon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What if we kidnap their children? Then they'll be willing to pay for them. They'll pay hundreds of millions of dollars, let alone one million dollars!" said Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's expression changed. "You want me to kidnap their children? Are you kidding me? Do you think the Reed family's bodyguards are just for show? I probably can't even get within one hundred meters of them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course, we can't get near the son and daughter who are with Jason. But what if it's the child who&rsquo;s not with them?" asked Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What do you mean?" Sean froze.</p></div>
