        <h1>Chapter 2503</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss hung up without saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Martin Weiss not coming?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, who was standing next to Grace, asked, "What's the matter? Is Martin Weiss not coming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "He just hung up. I know I shouldn't guilt-trip him, so I only asked him to come over and didn&rsquo;t say anything else. I thought perhaps Martin Weiss would feel sorry for Kyla and be willing to save her after seeing his own baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "He'll come. He'll come if he doesn't want to live in regret for the rest of his life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace listened skeptically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Time ticked by, but Martin Weiss did not come until the nurse carried the baby out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The baby needed to be rushed to the neonatal unit. Grace's eyes turned red again as she looked at the baby in the incubator. The baby&rsquo;s skin was red all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little human life was intubated. Whether the baby could survive depended on their will and strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had risked her life for the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a girl. 1.3 kg," the nurse said the sex and weight of the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The weight shocked Grace. Even Jasper weighed more than this baby girl when the triplets were born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lower the weight, the lower the survival rate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Being a family member, Mrs. Corbyn followed the nurse to handle all procedures to save the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason continued waiting outside the operating room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew they needed to observe the patient&rsquo;s condition for about half an hour after a C-section to make sure nothing was wrong with the mother before wheeling her out of the operating room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla was not wheeled out of the operating room even half an hour later. Grace immediately wondered aloud, "What's the matter? Is Kyla having some adverse reaction after surgery, so the doctor is now rescuing her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She surmised that the possibility was not out of the question due to Kyla's current state of health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pondered for a moment before making a phone call. Moments later, he said to Grace after ending the call, "Martin Weiss is here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Grace was taken aback. "Martin Weiss is here? Where is he? Why didn't I see him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's in the operating room," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was even more confused. Under normal circumstances, no one was allowed in the operating room unless they were the medical staff. Besides, she and Jay had been here all throughout. They had never seen Martin Weiss enter the operating room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason explained, "He entered the operating room through a different passage. Besides, he didn't go to Kyla's operating room. He's in the operating room next to Kyla's, ready to have his liver cut."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes widened in shock. "Is Martin Weiss going to donate his liver to Kyla again?"</p></div>
