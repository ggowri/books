        <h1>Chapter 3640</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From childhood to adulthood, he had never lived with the other person, so he had never regarded that person as his own family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? But sometimes, people are strange like that. Even if you dislike someone, you might find yourself missing them when they're no longer around..." Roger said, leaning against the wall behind him, seemingly reminiscing about something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper turned his head and glanced at Roger. In this moment, Roger seemed to be engulfed in a sense of loneliness, as if the whole world had left only him behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Jasper didn't know what happened, he just felt a pain in his chest, which gradually spread throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go," William's voice urged from beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Jasper lift his feet and follow William away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the car parked outside the welfare home, Jasper still felt a tightness in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's wrong with her? Why did she feel sad when she saw Roger earlier? Is it because he looks like how she imagines Lawrence would look when he grows up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So that scene just now gave her an illusion, as if she saw Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't look well, is everything okay?" William asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm probably just a little tired, a quick nap will do me good," Jasper said, fastening his seatbelt and closing his eyes to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked at Jasper like this, his eyes flickering slightly, there were some words he kept hidden in his heart, not asking them out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glance she gave to Roger just now was like a shock, but also like heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she looking at Lawrence through Roger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one day, Lawrence really appears in front of her, how would she react?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the orphanage, Roger leaned against the wall, looking up at the sky with the white clouds floating by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, he used to hate his parents too, hated why his mother was so greedily addicted to gambling, and why his father was so useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they both truly disappeared from his world, he realized that this annoyance was insignificant compared to their absence in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like it's really troublesome," murmured Roger to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he initially thought was revenge now seemed like he was gradually getting himself trapped...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...For William, he had no emotional attachment to Harold and Camelia as if they were family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he heard Roger mention that Harold's condition this time wasn't light and that he could pass away at any moment, his heart couldn't help but stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After nightfall, William still came to the hospital and approached Harold's ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing where Harold's ward was wasn't difficult for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harold's ward was a typical three-person ward, but perhaps due to the previous online reports about them, the hospital was afraid the old man would be bothered by others. Therefore, in this three-person ward, only Harold was admitted, while Camelia rested and slept on the adjacent bed.</span></p></div>
