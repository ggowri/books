        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"There should be ninety-nine," Terrence said. He remembered that there had been media interviews in which Mr. Stevens had said that there would be a total of ninety-nine projection ads, representing the love of ninety-nine lifetimes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been quite the campaign, sir. And it has certainly elevated Ms. Atkinson. She&rsquo;s a popular actress, but it&rsquo;s been reported that she&rsquo;ll have several leading roles in the next year.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Remove all of them," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"All of the ads?" Terrence was surprised.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"All of them," Jason repeated with certainty.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay, sir. I will do it." Mr. ReedMr. Reed suddenly wanted to withdraw the ads of the Stevens family. Had Sean or maybe Lily offended Jason in some way? Terrence thought hard about what might prompt this. When Jason had been engaged to Jennifer, it had marked a strong political marriage, with the promise of incredible financial gains for both. Of course, the Stevens had far more to gain. Reed Corporation didn&rsquo;t need them or their assets. But Mr. Reed had made no comments about the Stevens/Atkinson wedding, he had even accepted the engagement invitation from Sean&rsquo;s family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence was puzzled. Suddenly, he shivered and thought of a striking possibility.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could it be that Mr. Reed wants to withdraw the engagement ads because... of Grace?" Terrence was shocked by his own idea.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Would Mr. Reed do that for a woman? Not even for the sake of Jennifer, who was going to be Mr. Reed's wife, had Jason ever offended anyone in the business world.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What did this woman, Grace, mean to his boss? Gracehad driven the car that ended Jennifer&rsquo;s life.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence could not understand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn stood in the corridor of the hotel and looked at the man wearing a suit and leather shoes. He looked handsome and had the air of a scholar.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sean... I know. You and my sister&rsquo;s story is already history."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Stevens Group was going to shoot a large-scale film. After Evelyn learned of it, she eventually managed to find out that Sean was going to have a meal in this hotel, and from there it was a matter of prudent planning and plotting to find the opportunity to meet Sean.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since Grace was still unwilling to go and beg Sean, she had to come on her own!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Sean heard the word "sister" he was slightly stunned. The scene involving Grace in the club a few days ago came to his mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although that woman had once been the woman he loved, it was also because of her that the Stevens family had nearly been destroyed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it were not for the fact that he had broken up with her in time, and that the Atkinson family had helped the Stevens family, perhaps the Stevens Group would have become a third-rate company now!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He recalled seeing her at the country club&mdash;they&rsquo;d dined there many times when they dated&mdash;and when she stood there in her ugly navy blue uniform, with stains on the ankles and her hair in some sloppy ponytail, all he could think was &lsquo;my, how she&rsquo;d fallen.&rsquo; He hated Greg, but not enough to champion his ex-girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had been brilliant and hardworking. She was on the fast track to becoming a senator. She had the brains and the looks for it. Until&hellip;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing her at the bottom rung of society, literally learning garbage and sweeping streets, He could hardly believe it. Thinking of this, the scene of her climbing desperately towards him with her nails being pulled out flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She kept saying that she had been wronged!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He almost believed her, but there were both witnesses and material evidence. How could she have been wrongly accused?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This woman, in the end, still refused to admit her guilt!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And he hated her for it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She deserved every bit of evil that came her way.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's good that you understand," Sean said coldly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn continued, "Well... I'm now the only one in our family that can be counted on. I hope that I can be responsible for some important roles and earn more money to support my family, but it's just that I don't have any background, and my sister has been in prison. It will be difficult for me to get a good role."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn tried her best to frame the current situation in a miserable way, hoping to garner sympathy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Sean's expression was still frosty. Evelyn kept trying and said, "After all, my sister once enjoyed living a good life. I can't bear to see her being too down and out. I hope I can make more money and give her a better life now. I don't know if you..."</p></div>
