        <h1>Chapter 1951</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "He&rsquo;s pretty good. He's smart, obedient, and doesn't mess around." Children at this age were often naughty, but William had always been heart-wrenchingly quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The boy's close with Jasper, but he's Lily's child, after all," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze slightly, "Our feud with Lily has nothing to do with children." She did not want to involve the children in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, she had been deliberately downplaying it these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You might think he has nothing to do with it, but he doesn't necessarily think you had nothing to do with his mother's death," said Jason. He wanted to protect Grace and his children, so could not take the risk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a moment of reflection, Grace said, "At least, I have a clear conscience and will treat William well. But if he really has a grudge against the Reed family and me, then I won't sit idly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Or we could wait two years. When Jasper is no longer interested in him, we&rsquo;ll find an excuse to send him somewhere else," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jasper truly regards William as a friend. They&rsquo;ll only get closer and closer," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Friend?" Jason chuckled. "They can never be friends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, I got it. As long as the child doesn't step out of line while he's with the Reed family, I won't do anything to a child, of course. What's more, maybe someone will pick him up without me sending him away," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you mean? Who's picking him up? The Atkinson family?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That depends. I don't know who's going to pick him up yet," said Jason. 'Does the Barlow family of Deer City have anything to do with this boy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Everything's still up in the air.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had a phone call with Grace and found out that she and Jason had been discharged from the hospital, so she was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, after finding out that her best friend had made a one-month deal with Hadwin Stephenson, Grace could not help asking, "If he still rejects you after a month, can you really get over him and go back to Emerald City?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina replied, "Yeah. When that happens, I'll get over him even if I can't. Otherwise, I'd just be causing him trouble if I continue harassing him. It&rsquo;s better to give him my blessing than to be annoying. But now, I want to fight for my happiness for once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Not for the baby but for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Good luck! Call me if you come across any trouble in J City!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay. Thank you, Grace," said Lina. After ending the call, Lina put away her phone and looked at the dazzling cakes in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Each cake was beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had done her homework online and knew that there was a famous cake shop in J City. It would be Hadwin's birthday in three days. She also saw the news about his birthday party online and knew that he would hold a birthday party at a famous hotel in J City on his birthday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew he would never invite her to the party.</p></div>
