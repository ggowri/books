        <h1>Chapter 394</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It will be. Besides, Kyla, you have a great deal of life ahead of you. That's such a pessimistic thing to say. Maybe it'll get better in the future," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at Grace in surprise. "You seem to have changed a little."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Changed?" Grace was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, when you first came to my store, you seemed depressed, as if life was crushing you down. But look at you now, your depression seems to have dissipated. It&rsquo;s like you have hope for the future," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she... have any hope for the future? Grace was stunned. Was it because Lina was helping her look into the case? Was it because... there was a new beginning between her and Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That night, when Grace came out of the small restaurant, she saw a car parked not far from the restaurant. It was Jason's car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stepped forward. The door was already open. Jason was sitting in the back seat as he said to her, "Get in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going back with the electric bike, or it'll be a lot of trouble for me to come here tomorrow morning," she said. Who asked him to live in a place where his family owned so much land and property that there were no buses nearby? It was a long way from Reed Residence to the bus stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her with a smile as if he had heard a joke. "I'll send you here tomorrow morning." With that, he took her by the hand and pulled her into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little speechless. Considering that she only earned 4,000 dollars a month, how could she take a Bentley to and from work?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like when she saw the news about driving a BMW to sell oranges.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When did you arrive?" asked Grace. She was looking for a topic to talk about so that the atmosphere in the car was not too awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she was dating Jason, she did not know how to get along with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"About half-past six?" he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked. Half-past six? It was already nine o 'clock, which meant he had been waiting outside for two and a half hours?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You just waited in the car?" She looked at him in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he replied, taking her hand and gently rubbing it in his. Although the weather was starting to warm up, he seemed to like the way it kept his hands warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to get his temperature on her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You could have gone back first. You don&rsquo;t need to wait outside for so long," said Grace. She thought he had gotten off work late and stopped by to pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wanted to see you sooner." As he spoke, he lowered his head and gently kissed her fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was in the car, he saw her going in and out of the restaurant to deliver food. He even wondered why she chose such a tiring way of life when she could have chosen a simpler and more relaxed lifestyle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you don't want me to get you another job? You rejected me earlier because you didn't want to get involved with me. How about now? I want to help you. Will you reject me this time too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm doing quite well in this small restaurant, and I get along with my boss and the other staff. Besides&hellip;" Grace took a deep breath. "I know you&rsquo;ll find me a good job, but I want to be independent."</p></div>
