        <h1>Chapter 2586</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not putting in a good word for Martin Weiss. She only wanted to tell the child the truth and let him be aware.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even a child as young as ten years old could distinguish facts by himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson listened carefully. He could tell how much his daddy had done for his mommy from Grace's speech.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mommy had been saying how lucky she was to give birth to his little sister this time. They thought her liver was fine, but... it was in critical condition. His daddy even donated his liver to his mommy again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had looked up liver donation online and knew a person could only donate once, but his daddy had donated twice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt a strange sensation in his chest. He used to hate his daddy, but his hatred for his daddy seemed to diminish over the years with everything his daddy did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he heard that his daddy might have died on the operating table when he donated his liver for the second time, he panicked. He was afraid that his daddy would really die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How&rsquo;s Daddy doing now?" Nelson Corbyn asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's still recovering, but your daddy's health might not be as good as it used to be. Maybe his immunity and digestion will be worse than before," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn was momentarily silent before saying, "I'll... go home and check on Mommy first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, go home first," said Grace as she waved goodbye to her godson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn hurried back to the store, while Grace continued to wait at the school entrance for her second son and Veronica Barlow, the little girl from the He family, to finish school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, she finally saw the two little ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two children came out hand in hand while carrying their backpacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing Grace, Veronica Barlow rushed forward and politely said, "aunt Cummins, what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I happened to be at aunt Corbyn's store and thought I'd pick you up from school. What about you? Why are you only finishing school now?" Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today's my turn to be on duty with Mason," said Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mason followed Veronica Barlow. He did not have much interest in his mother, Grace. He only glanced at Grace before keeping his eyes on Veronica Barlow afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was already used to her second son's behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper was friendly and outgoing, Mick only cared about his family, and Mason only cared about Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a time when Grace even wondered if her second son was autistic, but the hospital check-up confirmed it was not autism. It was just that what happened to him as a child made it hard for the little one to open up to people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only person he opened up to was Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea when Mason would slowly open up and accept others, but whenever it was... she would wait patiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'll take you home," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Veronica Barlow replied in acknowledgment. She wanted to leave with Grace, but Mason stayed where he was. Hi little hand held Veronica Barlow's hand tighter, making Veronica Barlow stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mason, why aren't you moving?" Veronica Barlow asked in confusion.</p></div>
