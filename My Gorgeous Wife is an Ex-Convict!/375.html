        <h1>Chapter 374</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Have you forgotten what happened to your father?&rdquo; The old man once again brought up the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten, and I&rsquo;ve said it, I won&rsquo;t walk the path my father did,&rdquo; Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, you should chase that woman named Grace out of the Reed Residence and never let her appear in your life again!&rdquo; Old Master Reed growled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s not possible.&rdquo; Jason&rsquo;s gaze darkened. His heart tightened momentarily when he heard the old man&rsquo;s words and rejected the idea out of reflex. He would not even think twice about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You...&rdquo; Old Master Reed choked on his breath as he stared at his grandson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Grandpa, I will not walk the path my father did. I&rsquo;ll make sure that everything is under control. I&rsquo;ll make Grace so used to my presence that she won&rsquo;t be able to leave me at all.&rdquo; Jason had a light smile on his face, but the threat in his gaze was evident. &ldquo;Therefore, I hope that grandpa will not meddle with my affairs. If you do try to interfere, then I can&rsquo;t guarantee that I won&rsquo;t do anything to limit your freedom.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed was so angry that his complexion turned red. Only after coughing a few times did he calm down. Nevertheless, it was evident that the old man had been infuriated. &ldquo;Are you threatening me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m just reminding you.&rdquo; Jason stared at the old man. &ldquo;If anything bad happens to her, then both of us will be standing at different camps!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed might have been weak, but his gaze was still sharp as he glared at his grandson. He understood that Jason was not humoring him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What is so good about that woman that has made you so bewitched by her?&rdquo; It was something that Old Master Reed could not figure out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed had asked his men to catch Grace and bring her to him to have a look once. To him, she was a plain Jane that was a huge difference from the ideal granddaughter-in-law he had in mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s the first woman to have ever made me call her Sis.&rdquo; Jason smiled. It was because she once said that they could rely on each other from that day onward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was her that gave him a sense of home once again after so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each time he called her Sis, it made him feel that they were indeed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to retain that feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed looked in disbelief at his grandson as if his reply earlier was some joke that had been cooked up on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason casually responded, &ldquo;Grandpa, you won&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed bellowed, &ldquo;There will come a day when you&rsquo;ll regret it!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;So grandpa, perhaps you should try to live for many more years to see if that day when I will regret it will come.&rdquo; Jason smiled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Good... excellent! I await the day to see your face filled with regret!&rdquo; Old Master Reed challenged in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later that afternoon, Grace exited the restaurant with the dishes she had cooked in the morning as well as the incense and ingots she had bought the night before. She then headed for her mother&rsquo;s grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, when her mother passed away, her father did not purchase a plot of land in the cemetery. He merely buried her in the burial area of his friend&rsquo;s village.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reason being it was cheaper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, her father merely needed to give the villagers a few sticks of cigarettes and bribe his way through. It was way cheaper than buying a plot of land in the cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later on, the idea of moving her mother to a better grave on an auspicious date came across her mind, after all, her mother&rsquo;s grave was merely a simple one in the mountains near the village.</p></div>
