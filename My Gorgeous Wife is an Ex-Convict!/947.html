        <h1>Chapter 946</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella looked at Grace's purple gown with a flash of jealousy in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian had refused to give her the purple dress she was interested in and only sent her to the store to pick another one out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she chose a purple dress, Brian faintly remarked that it did not suit her current complexion. In the end, she changed her pick to a beige dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, Grace was wearing a purple gown and it was almost like a slap in her face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace, Brian is just wondering why you're with Mr. Reed again. Didn't you two break up? Is there some misunderstanding? Or is it that life hasn't been great since you left Mr. Reed, so you couldn&rsquo;t help but to go back to him?" Stella pretended to be concerned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella deliberately wanted to make others think that Grace only returned to Jason&rsquo;s side because she was already used to living the lifestyle of the wealthy. After leaving Jason, she was reluctant to give up the money and material comforts, so she got together with Jason again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It did not occur to her that what she thought was a more subtle and skillful allusion was, in the eyes of the other three, a very poor one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's none of your business," Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"None of my business? You're my cousin. Who should I care about if not you?" Stella kept on pretending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why don't we talk about what happened during our childhood..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella's expression immediately changed when Grace said this. She knew Grace was referring to Brian's rescue from back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was not sure who Brian would believe if Grace told him this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We didn't get along when we were kids, but that doesn't mean I don't care about you. We're relatives, after all," muttered Stella as she stammered a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? Relatives?" Jason's voice rang sarcastically as he looked coldly at Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella could not help but wince a little, feeling as if he had seen through her. Subconsciously, she could not help but hide behind Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian frowned and said to Jason, "Stella is only concerned about her cousin. Why do you have to frighten her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason looked coldly at Brian. "You and I both know she's not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was silent. 'Yes, he has met all kinds of people. Of course, he can see that Stella doesn&rsquo;t care about Grace at all.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... Stella was the one he had been looking for. She was his savior, and it was natural for him to defend Stella on such occasions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't let you lay a hand on her," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll tell you the same thing," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, what they meant was different. Brian would not allow Jason to vent his anger on Stella and hurt her, while Jason would not allow Brian to give a go at Grace and occupy her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two men looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella was secretly delighted. 'Is Brian... protecting me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'So I do occupy a place in Brian's heart after all!' Stella gave Grace a defiant look of triumph as she thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'So what if Grace is the one who actually saved Brian's life? I'm the one Brian cares about now! Me, Stella!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace only found the defiant look in her cousin's eyes extremely amusing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turned out that sometimes a cuckoo that took over a magpie's nest would actually think it was a magpie. However, looking at the way things had already turned out, she did not want to talk about it anymore.</p></div>
