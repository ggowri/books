        <h1>Chapter 3682</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So her father explained further, "Firstly, Lawrence has changed too much now and is not the same person as before. Secondly, if you still feel guilty about what happened in the past, then when he encounters difficulties in the future, the Reed family will naturally help him out. You don't need to get too close to him to make up for it. Thirdly, now that you are with William, you should also consider his feelings appropriately. Listen to your father, William is definitely not as gentle as he appears on the surface."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jasper looked at William's handsome face and Dad said that William didn't want to appear as gentle as he looked on the surface. So, what would he be like in reality?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her memory, he had always been gentle and never had too intense emotions. Even when he was bullied before, he silently endured it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter when, he always looked so elegant, polite, and smiling in a refined manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was used to sharing her joys and sorrows with him, and he was the best listener. Therefore, she was also used to his gentle appearance. It was almost hard to imagine what he would be like without this gentleness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I say I'm not jealous, it must be a lie," William said softly. "Lawrence is too important to you, and he also holds a significant place in your heart. Actually, every time you worry about Lawrence, get close to him, or even think about him, I feel nervous and scared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked puzzled when she heard this. "What are you nervous and scared about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm afraid that you don't just see Lawrence as a friend, and I'm afraid that his place in your heart will become more and more important," he said while raising his hand and gently tucking the hair beside her cheek behind her ear. "Jasper, we have known each other for more than ten years, but in my opinion, the only boy you have been thinking about besides me is Lawrence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's because..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, it's because he disappeared, so you have been looking for him. Even if you only spent less than a year with him, you have been missing him and thinking about him for so many years. He has always held an important place in your heart," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Jasper didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because what he said was true!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, when I see him getting close to you now, I feel jealous, worried, and scared that you might like him more than me in the future," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't!" she said. "My feelings for him are completely different from your feelings for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, but there was a hint of doubt in his eyes. Was it really...different?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she really understand the difference between her feelings for him and Lawrence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had this question in his mind, but he never asked it. Perhaps he was afraid that once he asked it, it would be like Pandora's box, causing everything to spiral out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you still helped me find this toy?" she asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he spoke lightly, she understood that the process was probably much more complicated than he made it out to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because it's a knot in your heart, isn't it?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned. "You know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know," he said. "You've also tried to find the whereabouts of this toy, and even posted on the internet about it. It's clear that you've always wanted to find this toy. So, if that's the case, shouldn't I help you find it?"</span></p></div>
