        <h1>Chapter 1953</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's heart sank. She took a deep breath and said, "I'm not aborting this baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers said, "What's the matter? Are you going to say you're not after money and you love Hadwin, so won't abort the baby no matter what? I've seen a lot of women like you. You think you can join a rich family and live a good life after giving birth. But there&rsquo;s no shortage of children in rich families. Even if you do give birth to the baby, you can't join the Stephenson family. What's more, it's unconfirmed whether the baby in your belly is Hadwin's."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina pressed her lips together tightly and suddenly burst out in laughter. "A woman like me? Or are you talking about yourself, Aunt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe she should be smart and give in. This person was Hadwin's mother, and she should not make things so awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... she did not want to put up with being slandered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She loved Hadwin, but that did not mean... she could be stigmatized like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough, as soon as she finished speaking, Emily Flowers immediately paled. She gave birth to a child to marry into a rich family, and ironically, she was still a homewrecker even though her son was the patriarch of the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before her husband died, he had not divorced his first wife nor did he make her official!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She just spoke as if she was talking about herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What a rude thing!" Emily Flowers said with a dark face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said indifferently, "I'm selectively polite. Since you don't like me, I think there's nothing more to talk about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Lina got up to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers clenched her teeth and said, "Abort the baby and I&rsquo;ll give you ten million dollars. With the money, you won't have to worry about your life in the future, and you can also find a man of your own caliber." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you think your grandchild is worth only ten million?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers's eyes grew colder. "How much do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ten billion," Lina grinned and said a shocking number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers said with almost no hesitation, "Dream on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "I know, right? Aren't you dreaming too? I won't abort the baby in my belly. If Hadwin still wants me, then I&rsquo;ll be with him. Our family of three isn't going to separate. If he doesn't want me, I'll return to Emerald City with the baby and raise them alone. I won't take a cent from the Stephenson family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her voice was very clear as she looked at Emily Flowers's eyes directly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers froze before sneering. "You make it sound nicer than it is. Once the baby is born, you'll have the leverage to fight. If you won't abort the baby, then don't blame me for doing it myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina shuddered and looked at Emily Flowers warily. A sense of foreboding rose in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers asked her men to enter the private room and then said to Lina, "It's easy to abort a child. You just need some external impact."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." Lina felt a chill all over her body. She never expected Hadwin Stephenson's mother to resort to this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two men who entered the private room approached her, ready to attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina protected her stomach with her hands. Even though she thought she was being careful enough before, it turned out she was still negligent. She thought she was Hadwin's mother, so at most, his mother would only speak harshly to her if she did not like her. </p></div>
