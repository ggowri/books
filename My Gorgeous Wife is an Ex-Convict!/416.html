        <h1>Chapter 415</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where's Grace? Isn't she here?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace... went out for a delivery. She won't be back until later," replied Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not ask any further. He only ordered a cup of coffee milk tea. Then, he sat down and drank it slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With famous people like Brian in the restaurant, he naturally attracted a lot of attention. Although there were not many people in the restaurant at the moment, few people recognized him as the entertainment industry's crown prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his looks, stature, and the invisible indifference that seemed to emanate from his body alone were strangely compelling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many of the customers in the restaurant kept looking at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Kyla Corbyn could not help but sigh while watching Brian sip on his coffee milk tea. He looked just like a walking advertisement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even she felt the coffee milk tea in her restaurant had become a lot better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When will Grace be back?' thought Kyla Corbyn when suddenly she saw a luxury car parking in front of her small restaurant again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said &lsquo;again&rsquo; because a Porsche had already pulled up to the restaurant earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, a tall figure got out of the newly appeared Bentley, and Kyla Corbyn's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man wore a light grey suit and had delicate features. His bangs were pulled back, revealing his plump forehead. The man was pale and looked young, but there was a calmness about him that seemed at odds with the youthfulness of his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the man walked into the restaurant, Kyla Corbyn found that his most beautiful feature was his bright eyes that were somehow cold but uncontainably seductive when he looked up. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was this man&hellip; a celebrity or something?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was about to go up to ask what he would like to order when she saw the man stop beside Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two equally good-looking men looked at each other. After a while, the man pulled out a chair and sat down at the same table as Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was stunned. Did these two know each other?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, come to think of it, it was not strange that these two people would know each other. After all, they seemed like the same kind of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect to see you here," Jason said with a half-smile as his dark eyes seemed to survey him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Neither did I," replied Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Kyla Corbyn came forward and asked, "What can I get you, Sir?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just give me what he's having," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn made another cup of coffee milk tea and gave it to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You like coffee milk tea too?" asked Brian while raising his eyebrows a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took a sip and lightly said, "We can have the same coffee, but not the same people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face changed slightly. "People are different from coffee. Coffee is dead, but people are alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, are you sorry you made that decision? You want to compete with me again?" said Jason.</p></div>
