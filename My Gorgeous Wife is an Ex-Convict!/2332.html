        <h1>Chapter 2330</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until Martin Weiss was upstairs that Mrs. Weiss heaved a sigh of relief. She felt guilty when her son stared at her like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss returned to his room, the driver texted him to tell him where Chase Harper was staying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss dialed a number on his phone and said to the person on the other end of the line, "I'll text you something later. Help me find out the purpose of this person's visit to L City and his recent itinerary. Besides that, I want you to get men to follow someone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, Mr. Weiss," they replied respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss put down the phone, went to a secret door in the room, and pushed it open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a square room about ten square feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was a mannequin in the middle of the room that wore a white wedding dress, veil, shoes, and others. It was a complete set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had the wedding dress custom-made according to Kyla's size.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had never shown Kyla the wedding dress, so she was unaware that a wedding dress like this even existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Photos of Kyla were hung on the walls around the room. There were photos of her smiling at the camera as well as those that were taken candidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The greatest difference was that the photos of her facing the camera were photos from when they were dating. At that time, her smile was bright and gentle as if she had nothing to worry about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the photos that were secretly taken after, worry seemed to cloud her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should have emptied the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since he no longer had feelings for Kyla, there was no need for him to keep the photos and wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was somewhat reluctant to do it as if he had some sort of nostalgia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was he nostalgic about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I don't love you anymore," he murmured as if to remind himself of this reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had been thinking about Martin Weiss's hypnosis. She even asked Jason if he could find the hypnotist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The person is now abroad, and Martin Weiss probably paid them a lot of money after they hypnotized him. I'm afraid it won&rsquo;t be easy to trace their whereabouts now," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about Secretary Wang? Did you find anything? If Martin Weiss was able to find the hypnotist, it means Secretary Wang had a special way to contact the person," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Grace. "What do you think I should offer Secretary Wang in exchange for finding the hypnotist? Besides, so what if we find the hypnotist? Martin Weiss has already been hypnotized and forgotten his feelings for Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if he was hypnotized, there must be a 'code word' to lift the hypnosis. As long as we mention the code word, then Martin Weiss's feelings for Kyla will return."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But why should we do that?" Jason asked in reply. "Kyla was the one who chose to separate. Martin Weiss just followed her decision. Since they've separated, Martin Weiss can deal with his feelings for Kyla in his own way. Why do you want to make him remember when he has chosen to forget?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That may be true, but... If Kyla is the only one who still remembers their relationship, while Martin Weiss has forgotten all about it, then... Kyla..."</p></div>
