        <h1>Chapter 3439</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Like?" Mason's lips curled slightly as he glanced at his own white, jade-like fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, that kind of course is never enjoyable, but just a matter of survival!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he was a child, a man named Secretary Wylie made him constantly fight and struggle with animals. Although those memories have become blurry, the feeling of doing whatever it takes to survive still lingers in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, the father had him follow a renowned teacher to learn various combat techniques, always aiming for a one-hit knockout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just doesn't like the feeling of hitting, whether he's the one hitting someone else or getting hit by someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My father only said that learning these things is not just for protecting oneself, but also for protecting the people he deems important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he wants to protect Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you not like it?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just necessary," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So in the future, just see if there's any sport you like, such as swimming, skating, playing ball..." She gave examples one by one, hoping that he could find his own hobbies in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I will try to look and see if there is anything I like," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled and then turned her head to look at the competition taking place on the field.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze fell on her profile, then followed her line of sight to glance at Daniel who was in the middle of the game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Daniel is dribbling and running, sweating profusely, appearing youthful and energetic. In Mason's eyes, there is a hint of deep jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a game ended, Daniel changed his clothes and went to meet Veronica and Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Congratulations on winning the game," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," Daniel replied with a smile. "I don't have anything else to do, so why don't we go to the bookstore together? There's one nearby. Do you want to go check it out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at Mason and asked, "Mason, do you want to go to the bookstore here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Mason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them walked straight towards the bookstore. Along the way, Veronica felt many eyes on them. After all, Daniel was good-looking, tall, and full of energy, while Mason was elegant and refined. Although he looked a bit cold on the outside, this kind of aloofness was what girls liked nowadays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was squeezed between the two boys, and as they walked, they naturally attracted attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at the bookstore, Veronica and Mason picked out books while Daniel accompanied them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Cross, why don't you find a place to sit down and rest for a while? We'll pick out the books and come find you," Veronica suggested, knowing that Daniel had just finished playing a game and was probably tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay. I was supposed to come with you guys to buy books anyway," Daniel said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take a break first. Sometimes I browse through books and if you're standing next to me, I feel bad taking up your time," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Daniel gave in and said, "Alright then, I'll go sit over there while you make your choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the bookstore, at the end of each floor, there are a few wooden tables and chairs for customers to rest or browse through books.</p></div>
