        <h1>Chapter 3686</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man next to them also realized Jasmine's identity at this moment and couldn't help but widen his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Is my name too difficult to write?" Jasmine asked Derick, who had yet to sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not," Derick quickly replied, signing quickly and then looking at Mason standing next to Jasmine. "Do you want to sign too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason glanced at Derick indifferently. "No need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want, I want!" Tina shouted. "I also want TO's autograph, handshake, and photo..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I also want a handshake and photo!" Jasmine felt like she hadn't said enough </span><span>earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the two little girls excitedly surrounded Derick, meeting their idol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked helpless on the side. Having Tina as his fianc&eacute;e often made him feel speechless, but...he chose her himself, so he could only bear with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at the situation in front of him and estimated that it would take a while to finish, so he said to Chandler, "I'll go outside and get some fresh air. Call me when they're done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Chandler replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason walked out of the room and onto the backstage corridor. This was where the concert staff were busy preparing for the upcoming show. Mason leaned against the wall, looking out of place amidst the hustle and bustle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The concert... Mason thought of a long time ago when he was also brought to see a concert by someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he didn't think there was anything particularly interesting about concerts, the noisy atmosphere and even the songs sung by the singer were not very clear. But at that time, he felt very happy because the person he liked and cared about the most was sitting next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, that liking and caring had turned into a dead silence-like dullness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name Veronica... it must hold no meaning for him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like past relationships, it can be forgotten in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice rang out, "Veronica, can't you understand what I'm saying? I want to eat pasta from Encounter. Do you not even know how to buy pasta?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's body stiffened. How long has it been since he heard that name mentioned by someone other than the Reed family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it a coincidence that someone has the same name and surname? Or...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason lifted his eyes and looked towards the source of the voice. Not far away, a woman in a gorgeous dress was scolding another woman with a displeased expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman in the grey-brown clothes had her hair tied up in a simple ponytail and was bowing her head, repeatedly apologizing, "I'm sorry, Miss. Kinsman. The nearest Encounter pasta shop is closed today, and the other branches are over an hour away by taxi. Besides, if the pasta takes too long, the texture of the noodles will change. So, I bought pasta from a nearby shop instead. But I've eaten at this shop before, and the taste is also very good. You can try it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason stared at the figure in a daze. Even though the person didn't lift their head, just the back view and the voice were enough for him to know who it was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica!</span></p></div>
