        <h1>Chapter 3170</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda decided to go to the old Mrs. Hart's place, but Brian grabbed her hand and stopped her from moving forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda hadn't even had a chance to speak when the elderly Mrs. Hart beat her to it. "What's the matter, are you afraid I'll eat Valda? I'm just having a chat with my future daughter-in-law, I promise to return her to you in one piece."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mum." Brian furrowed his brow slightly and looked deeply at his mother, afraid that she might say something unpleasant to Valda about him being there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I understand. I'll be just as precious as Valda to you," said Mrs. Hart. "Now, please let go. Do you want Valda and me to stay here with you forever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian reluctantly let go of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda followed the old Mrs. Hart to the backyard of the Hart family. The old Mrs. Hart turned around and looked at Valda kindly, saying, "Earlier, our relatives caused you some trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much," Valda quickly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, you were chosen by Brian, which means you were also chosen by the Hart family, including me and Brian's father. If you have any grievances, you can talk to us," said the old Mrs. Hart. Her voice paused for a moment, as if she was sighing. "Brian loves you very much. I actually thought he didn't love you that much, but during the year you were missing, I completely understood how much he loves you. I think if you hadn't returned to Emerald City, he would have remained unmarried for the rest of his life for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Hart, the elderly woman, spoke and walked up to Valda, patting her shoulder. "You've had a tough year, and I feel sorry for you. But during this time, Brian has suffered greatly for you. Valda, as a mother, I only hope that no matter what happens in the future, you and Brian will stay together. If any difficulties arise, our family will work together to solve them. Do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Our family...these words also include Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes became moist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After her parents passed away, she lost her family. Even though her uncle adopted her, she could never truly become a part of his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does she have a home now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda responded, "I will be with Brian and stay with him forever and ever..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is her promise!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She once lost her home, but in the future, she will have a home again, a warm and cozy one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good child," said Mrs. Hart as she took a step forward and hugged Valda. "From now on, you are not only my daughter-in-law, but also my daughter. If Brian ever mistreats you, you must tell me, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled, feeling the genuine kindness of old Mrs. Hart. "I believe he won't mistreat me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because she knew how much that man loved her.</p></div>
