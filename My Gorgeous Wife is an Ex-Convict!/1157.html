        <h1>Chapter 1156</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace... If I may, I don't want your gratitude..." he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always kept his distance from people subconsciously. Even friends like Patrick would say that he was too cold, giving a person a sense of estrangement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if others could not enter his heart no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he seemed to know what it felt like to be unable to enter someone's heart. He desperately approached her, wanting to enter her world, but he always felt some estrangement from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she smiled at him, she seemed to be silently refusing his approach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just what could he do to truly enter her heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurried to the floor of the inpatient pediatrics department. She told the nurse at the nurse's desk Nelson's name and found the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was already asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lying in the hospital bed, the little one had thick white bandages around his shin, and his face was bruised. Even though the little one's eyes were closed, they were obviously swollen. It looked like he had been beaten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was sitting by Nelson's hospital bed, tears silently streaming down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stepped forward. Scaring she would wake Nelson, she softened her footsteps and asked in a whisper, "Aunt, what happened to Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're here..." Mrs. Corbyn sighed and looked at Grace as she said, "Nelson got into a fight with the other children in the kindergarten and... ended up like this. Oh, dear. He did a lot of tests today, and he's going to do more later. The doctor says he's okay, but it's still not reassuring..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn babbled on. Grace was surprised. 'A fight?' In her opinion, Nelson was shy and would not make a move to get into a conflict with others. Even if the little one did not like them, he would just ignore them at most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did Nelson get into a fight?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn sighed. "The boy fought with the kids... because of his mother. They told him that his mother had been in prison and was a bad person, so he started fighting with the kids."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, tears welled up in Mrs. Corbyn's eyes again. "Kyla has suffered enough, and now, this happened to Nelson too. I don't know if he can attend that kindergarten anymore. What are we going to do??"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace guessed that it was because Paisley Daniels had deliberately mentioned Kyla's imprisonment at the kindergarten&rsquo;s gates, so the story spread around the kindergarten&mdash;so much so that even the children would run up to Nelson and say such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Kyla Corbyn also entered the room. As soon as she saw Grace, she said, "It's late yet you still came over. Thank you so much for earlier. I'll pay you back tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take your time," said Grace as she looked at Kyla Corbyn's tired face with red eyes. Her face was utterly pale under the lights. "Kyla, I heard about Nelson's incident from Aunt. He probably fought those kids today to defend you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I know." Kyla Corbyn looked gently at her sleeping son. She naturally knew that her son did not like others saying she was a bad person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Nelson did not know that in the eyes of the world, she deserved to be imprisoned. She was a bad woman!</p></div>
