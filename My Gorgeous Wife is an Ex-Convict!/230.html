        <h1>Chapter 229</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did I frighten you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated. "I know you're just treating me like a game. You're interested in me now because you think it's fun. Once your interest wanes, then I'm worthless. If I offend you by accident, things might be as worse as what it was like in prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want any more of those dark and miserable days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you afraid that you'll offend me now by saying that?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body suddenly stiffened. Yes, of course, she was afraid, but she chose to say it anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her expression said it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a terrible silence all around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her head, and all she could hear was her breathing and heartbeat. Jason did not say anything, but she could feel that his eyes were on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one knew how much time had passed. Suddenly, she heard his voice. "If I say I'm not treating you as a game, will you want to stay with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her head suddenly and looked at him in astonishment as if she had not expected him to say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you?" His eyes were still fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gave a bitter smile. "What am I supposed to do by your side? Continue to be your sis? Or be your playmate? Either way, I'm afraid I'm not up to the task."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips drew a straight line, and his eyes grew cold. The word &lsquo;wife&rsquo; was stuck in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she asked, he could marry her. However, had Jason ever needed to ask a woman to be his wife?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly gave her a faint smile and bent down slowly. He brushed her cheek gently. "Since Sis has already said so, let's go ahead and see who is more patient. Will I be the first to give up on keeping Sis with me, or will Sis be the first to beg to stay with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace became slightly short of breath, and her body shook as he got closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was always so unpredictable. He could look like he was angry at one second and then be like the calm after a storm the next second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having said that, Jason walked over to the table, pulled up a chair, and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was relieved and felt another cold sweat break out on her back and palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she caught a glimpse of him casually picking up her phone. She shuddered and tried to grab her phone back from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was too late. He had already seen what was on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason slightly raised his eyebrows and looked at Grace, half smiling. "Why, are you searching for news about me? If you have something to ask me, you can just call me and ask instead of searching the internet like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." She gasped. How could she explain this? Could she say that she just saw an influencer's live stream and, out of curiosity, searched for the relevant content?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The party you attended today just started when you left. Doesn't it matter if you just come out like that?" She could only digress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a party," he said nonchalantly. There were many parties like that in a year, and sometimes, he did not even bother to attend at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis hasn't finished eating yet. Go on." He glanced at her half-eaten takeaway food, then calmly drew a chair and sat down.</p></div>
