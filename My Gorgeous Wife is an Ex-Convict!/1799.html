        <h1>Chapter 1797</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "They're just strangers who misunderstood. Don't take it to heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His casual attitude made her feel less awkward. Suddenly, as if she recalled something, she said, "By the way, don't tell anyone about my pregnancy. I... haven't told my parents yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman froze slightly. Surprise flashed across his eyes as he asked, "Is Hadwin Stephenson unwilling to take responsibility?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Huh?" Lina blinked and did not react in time to Anthony Sherman's wild speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you scared to tell your parents about your pregnancy because Hadwin Stephenson refuses to take responsibility?" asked Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I didn't tell my parents because..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before Lina could finish, a voice interjected. "Who did you say isn&rsquo;t taking responsibility?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina shuddered, feeling her hair standing on end. She turned around only to see Hadwin Stephenson standing a few steps behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Gosh! When did he come here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman was also surprised to see Hadwin Stephenson. The way his eyes stared at him made Anthony Sherman feel a chill running down his spine for no reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson slowly walked to Lina's side, bent down slightly, and leaned close to Lina. He said, "What's the matter? Did you tell him I'm not taking responsibility?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't... Don't come so close to me." Lina's face reddened slightly as she tried to back away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the next moment, his big hand was already around her waist. "Why didn't you tell him how you got close to me?" he asked. His face seemed a little pale under the moonlight, but his voice was amorous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's face instantly turned even redder. For a moment, she did not know how to refute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "In that case, are you willing to be responsible for Lina, Mr. Stephenson? Then take on the responsibilities a man should!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though he was facing the president of Stephenson Group, Anthony Sherman did not back down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson chuckled. "What do you know? Don't you think it's funny that you, a man who doesn't know anything, are telling us what to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "I don't understand a lot of things, but I'm Lina's friend. Since you knocked her up, you should cherish her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Cherish?" A touch of danger flashed across Hadwin Stephenson's eyes. He loosened his arm that was around Lina's waist with a cold expression and turned to face Anthony Sherman. "Who are you to say that in front of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you don't cherish Lina, someone else will cherish her!" Hadwin Stephenson's imposing manner and the sense of danger he exuded intimidated Anthony Sherman, but he still said what he wanted to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson frowned. Seeing that something was wrong, Lina hurriedly said to Anthony Sherman, "Yulai... L-Let's call it a day. Although we didn't get to see the concert, thank you anyway!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman figured out Lina's hint, but he still asked with worry, "Do you want me to send you home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was about to speak when she felt Hadwin Stephenson's fingers gripping her arm hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, she smiled awkwardly at Anthony Sherman and said, "No thanks... Hadwin Stephenson... will send me home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman looked at Lina before looking at Hadwin Stephenson. He dared not say anything more, so he nodded. "Call me if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," replied Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Anthony Sherman left, Hadwin Stephenson snorted coldly. "You're getting along well with your blind date. What's the matter? Were you even planning to attend a concert together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina turned to look at the person in front of her and sighed. "He and I are just friends. I wanted to watch GB's concert but failed to get a ticket. Anthony Sherman helped me get the tickets."</p></div>
