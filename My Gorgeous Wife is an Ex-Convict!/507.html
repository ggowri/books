        <h1>Chapter 506</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been through a lot of criticism. Although she might be okay with it, what about him? Grace was a bit uncertain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You don't want to go?" asked Jason, frowning slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Am I fit to go?" Grace took a deep breath, looked up, and asked, "Jason, if I accompany you to the banquet, a lot of people might recognize me. I've met a lot of people when I was with Sean... Besides, I've been to prison..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what?" said Jason, shrugging it off. "You're the one for me. So what if you've been to prison? So what if you&rsquo;re recognized?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he took her hand, drew it to his lips, and kissed it softly. "Didn't you bring me home when I was like a vagrant on the streets, Sis? Did you ever think if I was someone fit for you to bring home? Whether you're a princess or a beggar, I want you to stand by my side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His kiss fell on her hand. Her fingers felt a tingling sensation that went all the way to her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slowly, he raised his gaze and stared at her with his dark, deep eyes. "Besides, you&rsquo;re going to stand by me for the rest of your life. If you worry now, what about the future? When are you going to be able to stand by my side with ease? Do you really want to wait until the day you reverse the case?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt suffocated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't care whether your case is reversed, Sis. I only care about you. You are the one I&rsquo;m in love with, so you're the best person to stand by me," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips together and finally said, "All right, I'll go with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter what she had to face at the banquet, she was willing to accompany him because she loved him too. Since he had no fear of gossip, she had nothing to fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then it's settled." His fingers slightly grabbed her chin as his face slowly drew close to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately knew what he was going to do. She lifted her chin submissively, feeling his lips fall on hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His kiss was so tender and reassuring...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the Stevens mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean asked his wife with a puzzled look, "Why is your family's mall suddenly getting demolished? Didn't they invest a lot of money in the mall? It's also operating just fine. Why are they demolishing it? No matter what they're going to build, it won't make as much money as this mall!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the mention of the mall, Lily's face paled a little. Of course, she knew that the mall was making money. The demolition was a big blow to the Atkinson family, but they had to do it to save themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, they would lose much more than a mere mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason wanted it demolished. Can the Atkinson family stop him?" asked Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean was flabbergasted. "What's going on? Why would Jason want to demolish your family's mall?"</p></div>
