        <h1>Chapter 845</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who the hell is... this woman? She doesn't look like one of the socialites from the city. She's wearing ordinary clothes that look cheap.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Master Reed had massaged her knees and was even waiting on her so that she would take her medicine. Anyone could see that this woman was important to Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the medicine in front of her, wanting to laugh and cry at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man had been so cruel when they broke up, but now he was handing her the medicine and glass of water like he was the same gentleman when they were still together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gentleness and cruelty were all reflected on him incisively and vividly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She silently took the medicine and glass of water before swallowing the medicine with a gulp of water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he picked her up and walked out of the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The fancy car had pulled up in front of the hospital's entrance. Just as he put her down near the car door and opened it, she stepped back from him, putting distance between the two of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his eyebrows slightly, and there seemed to be a flash of surprise in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him so carefully as if she was trying to size up the man before her. Her lips opened gently as she spoke in a soft but calm voice, "Thank you, Mr. Reed. You really don't need to do anything for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just because we broke up? Even if we&rsquo;ve broken up, I can..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before he could finish, she had gently raised her hand. Her fingers, slightly deformed around the knuckles, touched his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled gently. Her smile was still as calm as usual, but it was as if it could seep into people's hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, this is the last time I'm calling you that. I'm just a normal person. I'll get angry, sad, unhappy, and miserable. Even if you treat our relationship as just a game, it's serious to me. I really thought about growing old and having children with you," Grace said quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke without complaint or hatred. She was so calm that it seemed as if she was talking about a common topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his heart began to tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Therefore, now that the game is over, I can't adapt as quickly as you can. It may take a while for me to get over the relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now that we&rsquo;ve broken up, I hope we can have a clean break.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You and I had nothing to do with each other in the first place, nor will we ever from now on. I'm not your girlfriend or 'Sis'."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice went on, and every word stung his heart like a needle or a sword.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even his blood seemed to be bubbling in pain, that excruciating feeling spreading to every inch of his body along with his blood flow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pulled back her fingers which were now warm from his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she knew that the warmth would never belong to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I want to forget you, and I will forget you. Please consider how I took you in and was nice to you&hellip; when we were dating. Please don't disturb my life anymore, alright? I know my place and I'll leave you alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she said this, she looked away before walking past him. At last, she whispered, "Goodbye, Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like saying goodbye to the time she had spent with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He immediately trembled. His hands tightened instantly while his eyes were fixed on the spot where she had been standing as if she was still standing in front of him.</p></div>
