        <h1>Chapter 4153 Accompanying</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So she wanted to accompany him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler stared at Tina for a while and finally nodded. "Alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Soon, Tina and Chandler got into the car and hurriedly headed towards Downtown with other executives from the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Upon reaching their destination, Tina saw the towering flames from the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Firefighters were continuously extinguishing the fire, rushing into the fire scene one by one, while high-pressure water hoses sprayed water onto the flames.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina stood beside Chandler, nervously watching the scene in front of her. The people who had been rescued kept crying out that there were still people inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> They could be their friends or relatives!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina knew that in these factories, many people came from out of town to work in Emerald City, either coming together as a family or being brought by relatives from the same place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But at this moment, a fire had put them in a situation where they might face separation by life and death at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Unable to resist, Tina turned her head and looked at Chandler beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At this moment, Chandler was attentively observing the situation on the scene, giving instructions to his subordinates on how to handle various aftermath tasks, including closely monitoring the injured who were urgently taken to the hospital and arranging their rooms for recovery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> For those who appeared to have serious injuries, he directly arranged for them to be sent to the best burn unit hospital in the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even in the face of such a disaster, the people around were all panicked, but his presence was like a lighthouse that could dispel that despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Fortunately, he didn't come to this factory today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina didn't know that sometimes Chandler would come to this side of the factory to inspect it! If he had come to the factory today and got trapped in the fire, then...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina looked at the flames still leaping, thinking that if he were inside, she would rush in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even though she knew that maybe she should trust the firefighters and wait outside for the outcome, it might be the best option.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But... human emotions are often uncontrollable. Just waiting might be something she couldn't do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why are you looking at me like that?" Chandler's voice suddenly interrupted Tina's trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She snapped out of it and realized that he had turned to look at her at some point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I just realized how important it is for you to be safe and sound!" she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After the fire was completely extinguished, some of the company's executives who came with Chandler, along with firefighters, were carrying out post-fire cleanup at the scene. Chandler planned to go to the hospital to learn about the condition of the injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The only relief was that although the fire was large, there were currently no reported deaths.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina accompanied Chandler to the hospital, where they saw the injured patients, some of whom were undergoing surgery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After Chandler learned about the condition of the injured individuals, he assigned someone to stay at the hospital to handle matters, and instructed the company to allocate funds for their treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina watched as Chandler carefully arranged everything. Only a person like him could give a sense of reassurance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was as if he would bear the brunt, even if the sky was falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Let me take you back home first," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I want to go to your place," Tina said. When she saw Chandler slightly furrowing his brow, she quickly added, "I have already talked to my parents about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After seeing the scene of the fire and the injured people at the hospital today, she especially wanted to be with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was as if she suddenly realized that life is even more fragile than she had imagined!</p></div>
