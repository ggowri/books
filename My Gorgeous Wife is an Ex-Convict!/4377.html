        <h1>Chapter 4375 Assumption</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">Harley paused, looking up and out the window, her gaze sweeping across the road opposite.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sure enough, she saw a crowd of people gathered over there, and in the cleared space within the circle, a few individuals were being filmed in front of a camera.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Among them, she instantly recognized one figure - it was none other than Calvert.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She didn&#x27;t expect Calvert to be shooting here today. Was it a coincidence that Lornell chose to meet here? Or did he know in advance that Calvert would be shooting here, and that&#x27;s why he deliberately chose this place?</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, no sooner had this thought crossed her mind than she dismissed it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Probably not. After all, Lornell never went out of his way for anyone, let alone someone like Calvert who had nothing to do with him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">From the vantage point of the coffee shop, she could clearly see the scene being filmed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The scene that was captured was of a man and a woman walking towards each other from opposite sides. The moment they crossed paths, the man wrapped his arm around the woman&#x27;s waist, pulled her against the wall, and forcefully kissed her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He must be about to kiss her passionately! Harley guessed to herself. But every time Calvert leaned his head towards the actress, he would pause, and then the director would yell, &quot;Cut!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Was it because Calvert was filming a kissing scene that he couldn&#x27;t shoot it well?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley was aware that some people struggle with their first on-screen kiss, especially someone like Calvert who wasn&#x27;t professionally trained as an actor and was just starting out as a model.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, if this advertisement had worked out well, he might have gradually made his way into the entertainment industry. If that had happened, his future path could have been much broader!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Today he&#x27;s filming a kissing scene, seems like he didn&#x27;t tell you about it, huh?&quot; Lornell said.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley chuckled, &quot;Why would he tell me? I mean, you wouldn&#x27;t tell your friends the specifics of your job, would you? Especially not to friends who aren&#x27;t involved in your line of work.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lornell pursed his thin lips slightly, &quot;So, seeing him kiss someone else, you feel nothing?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley sighed, &quot;It&#x27;s his job, why should I feel anything about it? Also, you seem to always think that something is going on between him and me. So, if you see him in a kissing scene, do you think I&#x27;d get angry? Jealous, perhaps?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lornell just looked at her, not saying a word.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley continued, &quot;That&#x27;s his job, and I respect it. Moreover, if one day he really becomes my boyfriend and needs to do kissing or intimate scenes, I will respect and accept it. My family is in the entertainment industry. If I can&#x27;t even accept this, then there&#x27;s no need for me to take over the family business in the future.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A flicker of surprise flashed in Lornell&#x27;s eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The person before him was far more resolute and decisive than he had ever imagined.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once, his impression of Harley seemed to gradually blur. Or perhaps, even though they had been engaged for so many years, he had never truly seen her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And it was only then that he began to see her clearly, to understand her bit by bit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It seems like you&#x27;re not opposed to the idea of becoming his girlfriend, hence the hypothetical scenario,&quot; Lornell said. &quot;But people who claw their way up from the bottom tend to seize every opportunity and become increasingly greedy. One day, you&#x27;ll realize that we live in different worlds from them.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley&#x27;s expression suddenly turned sour, &quot;Have you forgotten? My mother was just an ordinary person, to begin with. But my father never looked down on her. My mother never became more greedy. We shouldn&#x27;t be classifying people into ranks!&quot;</p></div>
