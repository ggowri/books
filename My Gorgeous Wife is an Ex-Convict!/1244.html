        <h1>Chapter 1243</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Patrick..." Brian looked at the person in front of him, in between laughter and tears. He looked like a broken-hearted child. "What do I do? I missed her... I really missed her this time... Have I... missed out on her forever... It's only been a few days. Only a few days... Why didn't I believe her? Why didn't I get out of the car that day to hear what she had to say to me? Why did I destroy her expectations when she thought of me as her only ray of hope..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian shouted, roared, and cried... Patrick had never seen his best friend like this. All he could do was stay by his side and comfort him as much as he could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After having dinner at Reed Residence, Grace washed up and put on the pajamas Jason prepared. She walked out of the bathroom and went to Jason's bedroom next door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of her personal belongings, clothes, and the like had been moved into this bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bedroom was not strange to her, but she had never slept in here before. The room was decorated in gray, looking a little cool. However, there were some red objects in the room today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was slightly surprised by the red comforter, red pillowcases, and a few small red objects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ve... really married Jason!' These red objects gradually reminded her that she was indeed married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was not in the room, but there was a light coming through the bathroom. He must be in the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace's phone rang. She picked it up, and Mr. Sweeney's voice came from it. "Is... Is this Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly replied, "Yes, it's me. Uncle Qin, did... Did something happen to Lina that you&rsquo;re calling me? Is it serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately began to worry about her best friend's current condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the doctor had said that Lina was not out of the woods even after the surgery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney said, "Lina is fine. Don't worry. I'm just calling to... thank you. Thank you for helping Lina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney thanked her with all his heart. Even though they were once upset with Grace for ruining their daughter's future, it was the person they hated who helped Lina after something like this happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes could not help turning red when Mr. Sweeney said this to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Sweeney's voice also came from the phone. "Grace, I... was in a bad mood previously and spoke harshly to you. I hope you don't mind. I'm glad that Lina has a friend like you! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I was just old and blind to have blamed you for everything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace repeatedly said, "Aunt, don't say that! If it weren't for Lina, I wouldn't be here today. Lina was transferred to another hospital today, but I couldn&rsquo;t be there because something came up. I'll see Lina tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, come and see Lina. Maybe Lina will sense that you're worried about her and will get better sooner," Mrs. Sweeney said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call ended, Grace had no idea why but her nose felt sore. She had an urge to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney had finally forgiven her after all these years. Lina would be happy if she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had tried to resolve her parents' grudge against her, and now it was finally resolved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Jason got out of the bathroom, he saw that Grace's eyes were red. There was a layer of tears over them.</p></div>
