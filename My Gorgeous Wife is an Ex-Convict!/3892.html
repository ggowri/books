        <h1>Chapter 3890</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These words naturally spread online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the gossip media reporters finally met Jason, they asked him for his thoughts on Archer's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As the Reed family's daughter-in-law, I don't need anyone else to judge me! If Veronica suffers any losses, I, as her father-in-law, will naturally help her get them back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as these words were spoken, Veronica immediately became the envy of many women online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not only did she have a young and handsome brother-like husband, but she also had a protective father-in-law like a CEO. She was truly a winner in life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This even became a hot topic online with the phrase "I want to be Veronica!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After that, the gossip media stopped reporting any news about the Barlow family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow family also seemed to have gone silent and didn't make any statements online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding was approaching and Veronica moved back to the Reed family's side. Firstly, there were more people to take care of her, and secondly, it was to avoid being disturbed by news reporters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica took a temporary leave of absence from school and would have to wait until after giving birth to complete her remaining courses. This meant that she would graduate a year later than originally planned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the night before the wedding, Veronica stayed in the villa arranged by the Reed family. They would pick her up from there the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to tradition, Mason couldn't see the bride on the night before the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper, Veronica's sister-in-law, stayed with her in the villa that night to keep her company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, although only Veronica and Jasper were in the villa that night, there were also a group of bodyguards and servants present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Jasper held a pillow and lay on the bed with Veronica. "Veronica, are you nervous about tomorrow's wedding?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A little bit, but not too much," Veronica replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it because you're too familiar with Mason?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe it's because I'm not too worried about my future marriage," Veronica said. "Although there may be difficulties and conflicts in my marriage with Mason, I'm not afraid of marriage. Marrying him is what I've been looking forward to the most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked and asked, "Does Mason argue a lot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's mouth formed an "O" shape. "Have you ever had a fight with Mason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sort of...," Veronica murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What was Mason like when he was arguing? Did he cross his arms, or shout and roar? Or was he the type to talk non-stop?" Jasper was clearly curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was sweating profusely. What was this little girl thinking? "Well... his voice was a bit louder than usual, but that's about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was too embarrassed to say that the few times she had argued with Mason, he usually ended up holding her and kissing her to shut her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And even earlier on, it was difficult for her to argue with him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see..." Jasper looked disappointed. "I haven't even seen what Mason looks like when he's arguing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Jasper's eyes lit up. "How about this, Veronica? If you ever have a fight with Mason again, just call me and I'll come over right away. Even if he's Mason, I'll definitely be on your side and help you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could also see what Mason looks like when he's arguing. She was too curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica couldn't help but laugh at Jasper's words, but she agreed to it as Jasper wished.</p></div>
