        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Grace said that he was her "little brother" in the morning, he felt that he had to see it for himself before he could rest assured.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The car arrived at the gate of a community of apartment buildings. The landscaping was sparse and while the buildings appeared clean and well-maintained, there was no debating that the residences were old. Sean parked, got out of the car, entered through the footpath for visitors, and searched the specific units. After some effort, he finally stopped in front of a narrow door.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was Grace really living here?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The unit was so small, he wondered if it was anything more than a single room, and the paint was chipping from the door and peeling from the window shutters.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean was about to knock on the door when he heard footsteps.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Subconsciously, he hid in the shadow to one side and looked in the direction which the footsteps were coming from.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It turned out that there was a tall figure coming toward him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the figure got closer and closer, Sean's eyes grew wider and wider. The occasional speculation that he had thought was impossible had finally become a possibility.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was... Jason! It was really Jason!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was no way it was just a resemblance. It was absolutely impossible for them to look this similar.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Jason's clothes were still the same as the ones he had seen yesterday. Why... Why is Jason here?!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean felt a chill rising from the soles of his feet, and his body was getting colder and colder.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, Jason stood in front of the narrow door that Sean had come to and raised his hand to gently knock.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A moment later, someone opened the door and said, "You're back."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The soft voice and sweet smile belonged to Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean only felt a breath get stuck in his throat and he stood there, not breathing and motionless.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a minute, he rubbed his eyes and sucked a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why? How?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even seeing it with his own eyes, he could still scarcely believe it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The person who opened the door was Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace is actually living together with Jason? What is going on? And why is Jason dressed like a homeless person?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Too many questions flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, he heard Jason say, "I'm back."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean had heard Jason's voice before, and the voice was the same as the one in his memory.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this point in time, Sean had no doubt that the man he&rsquo;d seen with Grace&mdash;that he was seeing with her now&mdash;was Jason Reed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as Jason was about to enter the room, his steps suddenly paused. He looked towards the dark corner where Sean was hiding.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Sean felt that all the blood in his body had stopped flowing, and he froze like an animal in the sight of a much larger predator.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay, what are you looking at?" Grace's voice sounded again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's nothing." Jason's lips curled slightly into a smile. Then, he walked into the apartment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a bang, the door was closed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean took a deep breath. His palms and back were already covered with cold sweat. He felt as if he had just escaped death.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What was going on? Why was Jason together with Grace?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean walked out of the apartment complex with no strength in his legs and returned to his car. However, when he wanted to start driving, he found that his hands were shaking violently.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at how Grace has been getting along with Jason, it seemed like they were already very familiar with each other. Furthermore, Grace had called Jason &ldquo;Jay."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In all the years of doing business together, Sean still referred to him as Mr. Reed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had never heard anyone call him so intimate.</p></div>
