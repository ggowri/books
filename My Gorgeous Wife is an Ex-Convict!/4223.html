        <h1>Chapter 4221</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Tina!" These were the first words Kit said when he saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that maybe he would never see her again, that maybe when he watched her being wheeled from the operating room to the hospital room, it would be the last time he saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't expect the Stephenson family to suddenly come and tell him that Tina wanted to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina actually wanted to see him?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Stephenson family told him that Tina already knew the whole truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made him feel instantly guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, he didn't want to face her, but Tina wanted to see him, and he still wanted to see her one more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he didn't know how to approach her, he still wanted to see her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he agreed to the Stephenson family and came here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he saw her, he suddenly didn't know what to say. The words that came out instinctively were only "I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you sorry for?" Tina's voice suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit choked and said, "I lied to you, Tina. I'm sorry, I'm a liar! I shouldn't have lied to you! I should have contacted your parents when I found you and handed you over to them, instead of weaving one lie after another."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the point where the lies grew bigger and bigger, even reaching a point where they couldn't be contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's heart sank, "Did you really lie to me? Were all the things you said to me after finding me lies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said you were the person I loved, the father of the baby in my belly, were those lies too?" she continued to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Kit's heavy "yes," Tina's heart sank like it was plunging into an endless abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" she asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before seeing him, she had thought that if he gave a negative answer, she might struggle, hesitate, and maybe choose to believe him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he admitted it so directly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I love you," he said, "I didn't expect that I would love you so much. When you went missing, I felt like the sky was falling, so I quit the entertainment industry and started searching for you alone. I also didn't expect that I would find you earlier than the Hunter family and the Stephenson family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a pie falling from the sky, hitting him all at once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, do you know? Originally, I just wanted to spend a few more days with you, so I made up this lie. I knew very well that this lie wouldn't last forever, that it would eventually be exposed, but I was too greedy." Kit said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After acquiring some, he greedily wanted more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much so that in the end, his greed hurt her, and her precious child that she cherished so much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mistake was unforgivable, and he knew it all too well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why he never begged for her forgiveness, he just wanted to see her, even if it was just for one more glance, he was willing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina suddenly gave a bitter smile, "You loved me, so you were greedy, so you deceived me! Did you ever think about what would happen if one day I found out the truth? What would it mean to me if the lies were exposed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, truly sorry!" Apart from that, he didn't know what else he could say!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let me ask you, is Chandler really my husband? Is he the father of my child in my womb?" Tina asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit's eyelashes trembled as he met Tina's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that some answers, once spoken, would truly be the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this truth should have been told by him when he first found her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he is your husband, you love him very much. Originally, you two were already married, but on the day of the wedding, an accident happened and you went missing in the water!" Kit painfully revealed the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's emotions became even more complicated after hearing this.</span></p></div>
