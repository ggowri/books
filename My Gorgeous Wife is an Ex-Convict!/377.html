        <h1>Chapter 376</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shortly after, the neighbor next door informed her that her father and her stepmother had gone on a vacation and nobody was in. As for Evelyn, according to the neighbor, she had bought a larger house and thus hardly came home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace heard that, she knew that her father and stepmother had done so on purpose. They knew that she would be visiting her mother&rsquo;s grave today and thus planned to be away at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;50 million.&rsquo; Her scalp numbed at the thought of her father&rsquo;s request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her current situation, she had no way of producing 50 million for her father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace bid farewell to the neighbor, she called Evelyn, &ldquo;Where are you? I need to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;ve been very busy lately,&rdquo; Evelyn answered lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I only want to ask you one question, where did dad shift my mother&rsquo;s grave?&rdquo; Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Evelyn&rsquo;s tone was filled with mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then where are they having their vacation? You should know.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Oh, how unfortunate. I don&rsquo;t. Why don&rsquo;t I let them know that you&rsquo;re looking for them once they come back.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this time, Grace heard a man&rsquo;s voice in the background. &ldquo;This lipstick color doesn&rsquo;t suit you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback. She recognized that the voice belonged to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The voice was followed by Evelyn&rsquo;s which imitated the tone of a baby, &ldquo;I thought you liked this color. I&rsquo;ll change it to another one later.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn said to Grace over the phone, &ldquo;Alright, that&rsquo;s it. I still have matters to attend to.&rdquo; With that said, she ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the phone in her hand and felt an inexplicable feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just a few days ago, she met Brian. At that time, Brian said to her... yet right now, he was elsewhere, discussing which lipstick color suited Evelyn more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a man like Brian, perhaps he merely wanted to try something new; that was why he said those words to her as if he had special feelings for her. Nevertheless, it was without a doubt that men like Brian had feelings for many women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how he had been with his ex-girlfriends and was currently with Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once such type of men lost their interest, they were the cruelest. Similar to how Grace had witnessed the cruelty he had toward his previous girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for that particular ex-girlfriend, she used to be the hottest celebrity in the industry with a bright future. However, she was now nowhere to be heard or seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace kept her phone and could not help but feel her heart sink. She could not afford to fork out 50 million. Additionally, she was unable to track where her father and stepmother were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so... if she found them a few days later, would they reveal the location of her mother&rsquo;s grave?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, what price would they expect her to pay?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought that her life was at the bottom of the pit already, yet she realized that the worst had yet come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other end, Brian watched as Evelyn kept her phone. He casually asked, &ldquo;Who called?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Was looking for my parents. They&rsquo;re on a holiday so the person contacted me instead.&rdquo; Evelyn purposefully said it casually before going closer to Brian. &ldquo;Brian, what lipstick color do you like? In the future, I&rsquo;ll only use the color that you like.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian furrowed his brows. His gaze once again landed on Evelyn&rsquo;s lips. No matter how he looked at the bright red color, he found it annoying.</p></div>
