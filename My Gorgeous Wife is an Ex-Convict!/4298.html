        <h1>Chapter 4296 Can't Forgive?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pursed her lips, looking at Eugenia in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her friend. Although she had amnesia and couldn't remember their friendship, she could still sense that Eugenia genuinely cared for her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she didn't want to deceive Eugenia in this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already signed the divorce agreement, but I haven't submitted the documents yet, so technically, we're not divorced!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Eugenia widened her eyes. "So, you're really going to divorce him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that Tina was the one who initiated the divorce. After all, based on Eugenia's understanding, how could Chandler, who loved Tina so much, want a divorce?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know," Tina smiled bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia frowned. "What do you mean you don't know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was the one who suggested the divorce. When we signed the agreement, I really wanted to divorce him. But..." Her voice trailed off, and her gaze fell on the drink in her hand. "After signing the divorce agreement, I hesitated. It's like I couldn't bear to get divorced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because you have feelings for Chandler? Even though you have amnesia, you've spent time with him. Maybe during this time, you've already started liking him, or even falling in love with him," Eugenia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Falling in love? Did she fall in love with Chandler again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you have that expression? It's like I said something unbelievable," Eugenia said angrily. "Chandler is the kind of man that it's easy to fall in love with, you know? You should know how many women are longing for him. Men who are rich, handsome, and loyal like him are hard to find nowadays."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't it matter to you that he lied to you?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having heard Tina's question, Eugenia seemed to have already known what happened. "Did Chandler deceive you, and that's why you suddenly decided to divorce him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina remained silent, not giving an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her silence was enough to tell Eugenia the answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia pondered and said, "Tina, did Chandler's deception harm you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." Tina hesitated. Although he had kept the fact that he was by her side because of a curse hidden from her, he hadn't actually harmed her in any way. He had never forced her to have a child to break the curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even today, when she had voluntarily mentioned having another child, he had directly refused!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it didn't harm you or the people around you, then I think it can be forgiven," Eugenia said. "After all, who hasn't lied in their life? Many people have, including me. Have you never lied about anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina didn't know how to reply for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia continued, "At least, Chandler's kindness towards you is genuine. That day, when you were swept away by the current, he risked his life to save you. If it wasn't for the people around him forcibly holding him back, you might not have seen him today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking until this point, Eugenia couldn't help but sigh. "Tina, sometimes I envy you. To be loved like that by a man. He can love you even at the cost of his life. Can't you forgive his deception?"</span></p></div>
