        <h1>Chapter 2677</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland froze. She knew it would probably make her best friend even more embarrassed if they posted this online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people online would not distinguish the truth and only judge things from the surface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller opened the meeting room door and walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in the meeting room looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Truth will speak for itself. Miss Mack, if you want the netizens to be the judge, you can post it online. Actors going on strike will ultimately cost the film crew and the investors who invested in the film losses. Those who want to invite you to star in their films in the future would have to think twice. If you dislike someone in the crew and want to go on strike again, who's going to bear the losses?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said without fear. Besides, the speech was not only meant for Queenie Mack but also for the other actors who went on strike with Queenie Mack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Film crews were scared of actors who caused trouble the most when making casting decisions. Queenie Mack's reputation in the industry would probably be hurt if everyone knew about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, Queenie Mack's expression changed slightly after hearing this. The other actors on strike also looked hesitant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. Valda Theller, just apologize and we'll let it go," the director said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Camille Strickland immediately reacted strongly. "Director, why do you want Valda to apologize? It's not Valda's fault at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director rubbed his temples. He knew that, but he had to comfort Queenie Mack first if he wanted to continue filming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, compared with Queenie Mack, who had a backer, he would certainly ask Valda Theller to bear the responsibility since she was without a backer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The producer knew what the director was up to, so they whispered the pros and cons to Valda Theller, "Valda, no one wants to see this happen, but the crew is troubled too. Besides, according to the contract we signed with you, we have the right to claim compensation from the magazine and you if you affect the film&rsquo;s progress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the producer. It was clear what the producer meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she had done nothing wrong, society was realistic. Even if she had done nothing wrong, she had to apologize to the one who was in the wrong. It was because she was a nobody and could be discarded at will, while some people had backgrounds and backers, so they were much more important than her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned around and walked up to Queenie Mack. "I'm sorry. It's my fault. Please forgive me, Miss Mack."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland panicked. "Valda, why are you apologizing? You did nothing wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller ignored her and waited for Queenie Mack's reaction. Even if she did not care about the film crew claiming compensation from her and the possibility of losing everything, she did not want Camille and the magazine to get involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the magazine was also hit with a huge compensation claim, Camille, who was the one who recommended her comic in the first place, might have to bear the blame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack raised her chin and showed a smug smile. "I can forgive you. But you refused to be the stand-in yesterday. Will you do it now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pressed her lips together tightly and took a deep breath. "Okay, I'll do it as long as it can calm your anger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you do well, perhaps everyone will forgive you for what you did. But according to what was exposed online, you're gonna be a great stand-in," Queenie Mack taunted as she got closer to Valda Theller.</p></div>
