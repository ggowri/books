        <h1>Chapter 662</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who was Grace? She had been to prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a small town like this, people had a natural disdain for ex-convicts. Some would criticize Grace, while some thought that Grace should not be here keeping vigil at all. She was a disgrace to the Lu family, so they should kick her out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time the Lu family members heard something like that, they were so afraid that these words would anger Jason. If that happened, he would wipe out the Lu family and they would be too helpless for tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Stella was now under Brian's protection, Brian had never said that he would protect the Lu family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day of Old Mrs. Lu's funeral procession, Grace stood among the crowd while dressed in black. Her eyes were slightly red as she had obviously been crying again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason wore a black suit. He stood beside Grace and accompanied her to the funeral home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Lu family booked a hall in the funeral home so that they could accommodate those coming to the service.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stood silently during the memorial service. Her tears could not help streaming down her face as First Uncle told the story of her grandmother's life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those who loved her had left her one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mother left her, and so had her grandmother. Who would leave her next?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt a surge of fear in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a hand held out a handkerchief to her, gently wiping away her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared blankly at the beautiful hand. Its movements were so gentle and cautious as if she was a cherished treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head and looked at Jason who was standing next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason... Would never leave her. He would stay by her side and grow old with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When First Uncle's eulogy was over, the crowd began to move forward one by one to take one last look at Old Mrs. Lu's body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Grace was about to go forward, someone suddenly rushed out and pointed at Grace, saying, "You have no right to come forward. You&rsquo;re a disgrace to the Lu family and ought to stay in the corner! Have you not embarrassed your grandmother enough? Do you want everyone to know that her granddaughter is an ex-convict?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face paled as she recognized him as one of the men from town who had previously courted her. She was a rookie lawyer fresh out of college and was in the limelight. This man had come to Grandma's house to propose to her, but she turned him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After that, he spread rumors about her being snobbish and so on. When she was imprisoned, he and his family liked to talk about her to everyone in town, congratulating themselves for not marrying her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had heard of this matter but did not make much of it. After all, many people attacked her with gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just did not expect him to throw a tantrum at Grandma's funeral.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whether I have the right is none of your business!" Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let everybody judge. How dare you be here when you've embarrassed the Lu family! In my opinion, you probably have something to do with your grandmother's death. Your grandmother was angered by your imprisonment and that shortened her life by a few years..."</p></div>
