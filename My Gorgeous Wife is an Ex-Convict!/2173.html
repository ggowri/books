        <h1>Chapter 2171</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, shall we?" asked Philip Barlow as he led his son into the car. However, he glanced at the mansion and smiled faintly before getting in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, the car slowly drove away from Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the mansion, Jason received a call from the security guard at the gate. "Young master Reed, William has been taken away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I see." Jason put away the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace, who had already fallen asleep, drowsily opened her eyes when the phone rang. "Who&rsquo;s calling? It's already so late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sorry to disturb you. Go back to sleep. It's just the security guard at the gate reporting that Philip Barlow has picked up William," said Jason as he helped his wife with the covers for fear she would catch a cold. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" The sleepy Grace woke up instantly. "William left?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, he made a phone call in the middle of the night to get Philip Barlow to pick him up," said Jason. It was easily noticeable since William had made the call from the landline in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Jason had the gate unlocked so William could leave easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why would William suddenly..." Grace frowned. "Is it because he was beaten up by the servants' children yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Whatever the reason, at least he willingly left with Philip Barlow. Isn't this a happy ending? He&rsquo;ll be raised by his biological father, so he'll lead a good life. And we don't have to worry about whether he&rsquo;ll hold any grudges against the Reed family because he's Lily's child," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, no buts. Go to sleep first. We'll talk tomorrow morning," said Jason as he got into the covers and embraced Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace sighed. "I wonder how sad Jasper will be once she finds out William has left."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, as Jasper's mother, she could tell how fond she was of William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She's just a child. She'll only be sad for a while," Jason said indifferently, not thinking his daughter would have any attachment to William. "Doesn't she get bored with her new toys after a few days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William isn't a toy. It's different," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any difference to me," Jason said while embracing Grace tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a good thing to him that the kid was gone. If his daughter was really upset, he could always find new toys to distract her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, children always loved new things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, Jasper did not see William at breakfast, so she could not help asking, "Where's William? Why didn't he come down for breakfast?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William has gone back with his father," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper blinked her eyes in a daze. It took a while for her to react. "He... He's gone?"</p></div>
