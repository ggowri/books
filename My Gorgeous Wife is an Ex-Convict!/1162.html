        <h1>Chapter 1161</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had said that her eyes were bright. When she looked at people with crescent eyes and a smile, they would feel happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He added that her eyes were the most alluring ones he had ever seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers would always caress her eyes when they were being intimate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was once proud of her eyes because... he liked them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he wanted her to destroy them herself. How ironic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Opening her eyes, Kyla Corbyn looked up at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was standing right in front of her now, and they were close. She looked up, and it was as if they were back to the times when they were being intimate with each other. Only now, he would not put his arms around her waist, and she would not put her arms around his neck and be affectionate to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stared quietly at the man she once loved, hated, and where her emotions eventually came to peace. He was good-looking and attractive. Otherwise, how could she have fallen for him so easily?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps, this would be the last time she saw him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she felt a little regretful. Maybe she should have seen Nelson a little more before she came out tonight. However, as long as Nelson could stay by her side, it would be better than anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she whispered the word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was a little stunned. He saw Kyla Corbyn raising her right hand, stretching out her index finger and ring finger before sticking them toward her eyes...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instantly, he seemed to realize what she had meant by &lsquo;yes&rsquo; earlier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost instinctively, he grabbed her right hand quickly. His heart had almost stopped beating!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her right hand was firmly in his grasp, and his other hand was afraid that she might use her left, so he held her left hand firmly in his grasp too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... still had her eyes! At that moment, he felt fortunate that he had reacted fast and timely enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had it been a second or two later, her fingers would have stabbed into her eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you out of your mind?" He almost growled at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In contrast to his fury, her expression seemed calm. "I'm just doing what you told me to, Mr. Weiss. If I destroy my eyes, you'll let Nelson stay with me, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared intently at Kyla Corbyn. This woman had stabbed a broken wine glass into her abdomen last time just to not bear him a child. She was even more ruthless this time. She intended to destroy her eyes for Nelson&rsquo;s custody.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me tell you, I still won't believe you even if you really destroy your eyes, let alone give you Nelson!" Martin Weiss said fiercely, even sounding a little exasperated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's expression was still calm as if she had expected him to say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to take a gamble to see if Martin Weiss would keep his word after she destroyed her eyes.</p></div>
