        <h1>Chapter 185</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly flipped over and pressed her down below him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough... It&rsquo;s far from enough.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He murmured as his fingers gently caressed her face. Her alluringly drunk demeanor was like a budding rose, so beautiful and so attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes shimmered like the autumn dew whenever she looked at him. Her smile when she called him &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;, her hands wrapping themselves around his neck, her fresh, sweet scent filling his whole being&hellip; All these made him feel like he was being intoxicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It looks like I should not have said things such as not touching a drunk woman,&rdquo; he murmured. This was the first time he went back on his words, and it was all because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his head and kissed her lips while tossing and turning around. It felt so nostalgic, and he was so reluctant to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His physical urge that had been aroused by her needed to be appeased by her only.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if his body would only react so strongly toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know how long they were kissing for before they stopped. He found that she had already fallen asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What the...&rdquo; A rare helplessness surfaced within him. This woman was playing with fire mere moments ago but had fallen asleep, leaving him hanging there. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark eyes stared at the person underneath him. After some time, Jason sighed and pulled the covers over Grace before sitting back by the side of the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You owe me, do you know that?&rdquo; he mumbled as his voice dissipated in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The temperature in that little room was no longer cold. Even the air felt rather warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">-</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace woke up, she saw Jason sitting by her bedside and was flabbergasted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; she stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Do you think you could get back on your own after getting drunk?&rdquo; he asked her in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly recalled that she had drunk a huge amount of wine yesterday. Her memories only went as far as to when she was still drinking in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;So yesterday, after sending me home, you didn&rsquo;t go home?&rdquo; She was perplexed. &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t have sat there the whole night, can he?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yup, I didn&rsquo;t go home but took care of you the whole night instead. So, do you think that you need to thank me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;... Thank you,&rdquo; she said with a little bewilderment. He was the one who wanted her to drink yesterday, but he wanted her to thank him at this moment. &ldquo;By the way, will you release my uncle and the bunch?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was suddenly reminded of her motive for drinking wine yesterday. At that moment, she looked at him earnestly and nervously, fearful that he might reject her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked Terrence to settle it. They should be out soon.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She heaved in relief upon hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Once Uncle and the rest have been released, then my grandmother&rsquo;s illness should improve as well.&rsquo;</p></div>
