        <h1>Chapter 3651</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, there was a sudden commotion outside the study door, followed by Mick's shout, "Jasper, where are you going?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was startled and rushed to the door, opening the study door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, Mick was running towards the stairs. Another slender figure had already run to the bottom of the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper!" William shouted, but in just two or three seconds, Jasper had already run out of his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William and Mick followed and chased after her. When they reached the front door, they saw the driver getting out of the car, and Jasper had already driven away from them. It was too late for them to catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver who had just gotten out of the car was also confused, looking at the young master who was still standing in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was originally here to pick up the young master to go to school, but now Jasper had taken the car and left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William asked Mick, who was standing next to him, "What's going on? How did Jasper drive away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick looked embarrassed and said, "...She overheard the conversation between you and my dad in the study earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's expression changed, "Do you know how much she heard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She heard almost everything you said about Roger's true identity being Lawrence," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was only worried that her father would say something harsh to William, so she pulled Mick to eavesdrop at the study door. She didn't expect to hear such explosive news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Roger really Lawrence?" Mick asked William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It should be," William said. Uncle Reed had already confirmed it. If this later Roger was just someone who looked like Lawrence, it would be too far-fetched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick knew that Roger had been involved in William's grandparents' affairs. Therefore, he frowned at the thought that if this Roger was really Lawrence, deliberately hiding his identity to do such things, it was probably not for a good reason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper should be looking for Roger now! I'm going back to Stanford University!" William said, running to his car, opening the door, and preparing to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick quickly got into the passenger seat, "I'm coming too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William didn't say anything and started the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car drove out of the Reed family and headed towards Stanford University. Along the way, William kept thinking that if Roger was really Lawrence, then the fact that he had never admitted his identity and deliberately approached Harold and Camelia was probably a sign of ill intentions.</span></p></div>
