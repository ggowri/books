        <h1>Chapter 1151</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Let go! Jason and I are over, and he doesn't want to see me either. I think it'll only make him angrier if you bring me in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick glared at Grace. "Do you want Jason to kill someone? I don't care if you guys are really over, but no one can die here today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Patrick dragged Grace into the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a private room, but it looked more like a hall that was about 200 square meters. It had a bar, a billiards table, a game table, a karaoke booth... and a small stage that could be used for performances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A middle-aged man was on his knees, begging for mercy on a space that ought to be empty in the middle of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a pair of tweezers, stained with blood, in front of the middle-aged man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace saw the tweezers, her blood seemed to freeze immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had seen such tweezers before. Those scenes seemed to be imprinted on her soul, and she could not forget them even if she wanted to. Sometimes in the middle of the night, she would once again dream of those cold tweezers stabbing into her fingernails and skin, pulling out her fingernails one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People who had not experienced it would never understand such pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed, forgive me. I was wrong. I dare not do it again. Really!" The man kept kowtowing. His face was bruised, and there was blood all over his nose and mouth. He had obviously been beaten earlier, and badly too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do it." The cold voice only spat out these words coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head almost stiffly and looked at Jason who was sitting on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wore a black turtleneck sweater with black trousers today, and that made his face look colder. His delicate features were still the same, but there was an extreme chill and ruthlessness in those beautiful peach blossom eyes that people could not help but fear. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body exuded an aura that seemed to carry a sharp edge, making people afraid to get close to him. It was like a sharp sword. Once you got close to it, you were likely to get hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man on his knees turned pale and clutched the tweezers with trembling hands. Just as he was about to start, a shrill, trembling voice suddenly shouted, "No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All eyes in the private room, including those outside it, turned to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was then she realized she was the one who shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sitting on the couch, Jason glanced at Grace. Then his gaze fell on Patrick. "Patrick, did you bring her here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick smiled awkwardly. "I just... haven't seen Grace for a long time, so I brought her here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Jason said with a half-smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick suddenly shivered and felt a chill running down his back. "I think Mr. Lee has realized what he did wrong. You don't have to pull out his nails to have him make amends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kneeling on the ground, Mr. Lee immediately said, "Master Reed, I know what I did wrong. I shouldn't have forced myself on her just because she's a waiter. I&rsquo;m inhuman! I'm a scumbag! Master Reed, let me go. I dare not do it again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand and slapped himself hard as he spoke. Several red marks immediately appeared on Mr. Lee's face.</p></div>
