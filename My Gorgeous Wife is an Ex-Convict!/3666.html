        <h1>Chapter 3664</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was standing by the playground, and a girl holding something was speaking shyly to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation was usually a confession. Many people had stopped and were clearly watching the commotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, someone is confessing to Mason," Meave said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That girl seems to be the English department's beauty queen. Many guys in our school have confessed to her," Nina continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if she'll accept any of them! If she does, it'll probably be the talk of the school," Horea muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them turned to Jasper at the same time. "Jasper, do you think Mason will accept her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper replied, "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jasper spoke, they saw Mason walk away coldly from the beauty queen without even a second glance, as if what had just happened was just a speck of dust on his shoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were right on the money!" Meave exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really don't know what kind of girl can move Mason," Horea added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face appeared in Jasper's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, he felt that if anyone could move Mason, it might only be Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People like Mason are indifferent to emotions. It would be difficult for him to develop feelings for anyone without years of accumulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the last time he saw Veronica, Jasper couldn't help but frown. Although the Reed family was willing to support Veronica financially, she had refused their funding for the past two years, saying she could pay for her own tuition and support herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper wondered what would happen between Veronica and Mason in the future. Would they really remain strangers forever?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jasper was lost in thought, Meave's voice suddenly rang out, "Hey, isn't that Roger? Who's that girl with him? They look really close."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked over and saw Roger sitting on one side of the field with a soccer ball at his feet, as if he had just finished playing. There were several other guys sitting around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the girl sitting next to him stood out even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl would occasionally raise her hand to help him fix his hair, or touch his face, even using her fingers to wipe the corners of his lips, as if wiping something off, or intentionally tempting something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger, on the other hand, had a slight smile on his lips, accepting everything the girl did to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene looked like a painting, as handsome men and beautiful women are always pleasing to the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has Roger got a girlfriend now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was fast. He didn't have a girlfriend when we went to the mixer together before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But with his conditions, it should be easy for him to get a girlfriend." The voices of his roommates kept ringing in Jasper's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed her lips, thinking about how Roger had asked her to be his girlfriend at the bar just two days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he really get a new girlfriend in such a short time? And their relationship seemed to be going well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or did he already have a girlfriend before he said that to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter which one it was, it didn't seem like he was serious about his relationships. Did he really like the girl in front of him?</span></p></div>
