        <h1>Chapter 2088</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss only felt his heart clench at the thought of this. Even his body was trembling faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Nothing can happen to her! Nothing!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She meant more to him than anyone else. He could not live in a world without her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Kyla left the hospital, a black car followed her slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was looking at Kyla's back when his phone rang suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss picked up the phone and asked sternly, "What's wrong with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Weiss, Miss Corbyn isn't sick. She&rsquo;s pregnant." The person on the other end of the line told him their latest findings. "Miss Corbyn is now four weeks pregnant. She took another blood test today, and everything is fine..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The person on the other end of the line was still saying something else, but Martin Weiss could no longer hear them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was focusing on the figure not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She's... pregnant?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Without thinking twice, he was confident that it must have been from that night. The baby she was carrying must have been from that night!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The baby was their child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes were suddenly full of warm tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Child... Child... He did not cherish and take good care of their first child, causing her to have such a hard time giving birth to Nelson. He was even born deaf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This time, he would not make the same mistake again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would protect their children. He would spend his whole life... treasuring this child and not letting them get hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was still struggling with what to do. If she gave birth out of wedlock, she would have to face all sorts of gossip. What would her mother and Nelson do, then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you don't want the baby, medical abortion has to be done within 49 days of pregnancy. Of course, the earlier the better. And the easier it is to get rid of the baby. If you do it after more than 49 days, surgery is the only option and it's more damaging to your health." The doctor's words echoed in Kyla's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As Kyla was about to board the bus, a hand suddenly seized her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. Turning her head, she caught sight of Martin Weiss's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Panting, he grabbed her and would not let her board the bus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hey, are you getting in or not?" the driver asked impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," Kyla said quickly and tried to withdraw her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Martin Weiss continued gripping it and said to the driver, "She's not boarding the bus!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla watched the doors close before her eyes, and the bus slowly drove away from the station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." Kyla glared at Martin Weiss. "What on earth do you want? I thought we made things clear the other day!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Not at all. You never said anything about what we should do if you got pregnant!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla instantly stiffened as her pupils constricted suddenly. 'Does... Does he know I'm pregnant? He knew what I never even told my mother?'</p></div>
