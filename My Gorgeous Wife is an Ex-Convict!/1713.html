        <h1>Chapter 1711</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was silent. She thought she could get over Hadwin Stephenson. In the past years, she had been slowly getting over him. She would think of him less, and every time she thought of him, the ache in her heart would lessen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She thought she was getting there and her heart would stop stirring for that man one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson kept recurring to her these days. She would think of when he took her to the apartment, how he kissed her, what he said to her... and even lost sleep thinking about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had been trying so hard to get over him but she failed because of Hadwin Stephenson's reappearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "Are you going to get back together with Hadwin Stephenson? His engagement with the Jackson family has been called off. Even if you get back with him, no one will criticize you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina shook her head. "I&rsquo;ve never thought of getting back together with him. We grew up in different environments and don&rsquo;t share the same values. Even if we do manage to get back together, problems will surface sooner or later. It's just that..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She bit her lip and said frankly, "It seems that I still have feelings for him, so it's inappropriate and not fair to you if I date you. Anthony Sherman, thank you for everything, but I think we should end it here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "Actually, you don't have to be sorry for the time we've spent together. You've never lied to me about anything. I've never been interested in women. When I was young, I even wondered if there was something wrong with me. My family also wondered if I was interested in men."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's eyes widened in surprise. "Well... are... you?" After asking the question, she immediately thought she was being inappropriate and quickly added, "I don't mean to discriminate in any way. I... I'm all for freedom to love, regardless of gender. I've read a lot of comics and novels..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her face could not help reddening at the end of her speech. 'Gosh, why did I say that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman was amused by Lina, and the depressing atmosphere instantly disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "I'm not. I should say I'm not interested in both men and women. I also went to the hospital to check it out. Perhaps it&rsquo;s sexual apathy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Or maybe it's because you haven't met the right person," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "Maybe. Although I don't feel that way about you, I think we won&rsquo;t have any problems in our marriage in the future. Even if we can't be as loving as others, at least we're civil to each other. Isn't there a saying where love turns into family affection after marriage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a pause, Anthony Sherman said, "If you think it's too much pressure for you if we continue seeing each other on the premise of marriage, then how about we just be friends? In the future, if you're single and I'm not married, maybe we can consider getting together as life partners. What do you think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina blinked. "Are we each other&rsquo;s backups, then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Haha... Sort of." Anthony Sherman laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well, how about it?" Anthony Sherman asked. She had always been so straightforward but it was more comfortable this way. At least, he did not have to keep his guard up in front of her. He did not have to deal with the schemes and plots like in his workplace and would not feel any pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What do you think?" asked Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina smiled. "Okay, then we're friends now, alright? I'm glad to have a friend like you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I thought we were already friends," said Anthony Sherman. Then, they looked at each other and smiled again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After talking things over, Lina had a wonderful meal.</p></div>
