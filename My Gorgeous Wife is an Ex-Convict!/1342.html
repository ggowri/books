        <h1>Chapter 1341</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss glared at Chase Harper. His fingers that were clasping Kyla Corbyn's arm were now extremely stiff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, he felt as though he was the third wheel at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly loosened his fingers, and Kyla Corbyn said to Martin Weiss, "I'm going to lock the door and go to the hospital. Do you plan to stay here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a cold face, Martin Weiss stepped out of the door. Kyla Corbyn promptly took the key and locked the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper held Kyla Corbyn while Martin Weiss glared at their leaving figures. His teeth started aching once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's so good about this man? What does Kyla Corbyn see in him? Besides, how dare this man want a woman I don't want?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper led Kyla Corbyn into the car. The car was halfway there when Kyla Corbyn suddenly said, "It&rsquo;s okay, you don't need to take me to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you don't look very well. Why don't you go to the hospital to get yourself checked anyway?" said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's really unnecessary." She shook her head. "Thank you... for earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&#12288;&#12288;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That man must be... Nelson's father," said Chase Harper. After all, he bore some resemblance to Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. I'll hand Nelson&rsquo;s custody to him in three months. Then I'll go back to my hometown with my mother. But it was nice... meeting you, Grace, and Lina in this city. I won't forget all of you even after I go back to my hometown," Kyla Corbyn said with a smile, but the smile looked frail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're going back to your hometown?" Chase Harper was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, back to my hometown where I&rsquo;ll lead... a peaceful life..." muttered Kyla Corbyn. The upper part of her right abdomen was still throbbing in bouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She closed her eyes and clenched her teeth, trying hard to endure the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper looked at the woman in front of him. She was weak but was enduring the pain at the same time. She was weak but strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson had called him this morning, saying he had accidentally broken one of the toys he sent. He then mentioned Kyla Corbyn's injury. Therefore, he took some time off to come over to check on them but did not expect to run into such a scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was an outsider, after all. Some things were hard for him to meddle in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?" Chase Harper asked a little worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know what illness I have, so yes," Kyla Corbyn said weakly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace came to visit Kyla Corbyn, Mrs. Corbyn happened to be at home while Kyla Corbyn was taking her medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw the boxes of pills on the table. Her expression changed slightly when she caught a glimpse of the names on the boxes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn seemed to want to quickly put the medications away, but Grace was one step ahead. She picked up one of the boxes and examined it. After a moment, she said, "Kyla, what's wrong with you? Tell me the truth! Was it this illness that made you suddenly decide to give Nelson's custody to Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this time, Mrs. Corbyn's eyes turned red and she said, "Oh, at this point, what's there to hide? Just tell Grace! Grace will still find out eventually even if you keep it a secret!"</p></div>
