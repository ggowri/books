        <h1>Chapter 487</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she wanted to get down the bed, he said, &ldquo;Hold on a minute.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she watched as he lowered his body and knelt in front of her to help her wear a pair of socks. He put on her slippers for her before he carried her to the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Um, what are you planning to do?&rdquo; she asked in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you going to wash up?&rdquo; Jason asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Um... Okay. So that was the case.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once in the bathroom, he carefully let her feet down first, then her body, and said to her, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unable to stand properly, then grab on to me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she softly replied and looked up at the mirror in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They could see their reflections in the mirror. She could see him from the mirror with his head lowered, carefully preparing the toothpaste on her toothbrush...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;This must be how it feels like to be taken care of by someone,&rsquo; Grace thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; he said while passing the toothbrush to her. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unable to brush your teeth, I can do it for you as well.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I... can do it myself.&rdquo; She quickly lowered her head to start brushing her teeth. She did not notice that he was now staring into the mirror, watching her brush her teeth with her head lowered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s gaze darkened with endless obsession. &lsquo;She has finally fallen in love with me. She&rsquo;s mine now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;But this is not enough... This is far from enough!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face inched toward the crown of her head. He took a whiff of the smell of her hair. He mumbled, &ldquo;Love me more. Love me so much that you can&rsquo;t bear to leave me, okay?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was his deepest desire...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Who&rsquo;s targeting our family? What&rsquo;s this about empty stock?&rdquo; Camelia Meyer mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold blurted with a difficult expression, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Reed family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Camelia Meyer was shocked. &ldquo;Jason? Is... Is he too free that he wants to disturb our stock market? We don&rsquo;t have any grudges with him!&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;No grudge?&rsquo; Harold begged to differ. Although they had personally visited to explain about Grace&rsquo;s issue last time, Jason did not look like he was going to let the issue rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer also thought about it and with a disbelief look, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that Jason is doing this to us for that woman Grace!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when those words came out from her mouth, she found it hard to believe as well. After all, in her point of view, Grace was a mere lowly woman! A man like Jason would not go through such troubles for a woman like her, would he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To the extent of making the Atkinson family into enemies?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a woman who&rsquo;s an ex-convict!&rdquo; Camelia Meyer mumbled, still finding it hard to believe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Indeed. He&rsquo;s even going to this extent for an ex-convict,&rdquo; Harold said with a troubled look. &lsquo;This goes to show how important Grace is to Jason, more important than I imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;If I let Jason continue to empty the Atkinson family, he&rsquo;ll eventually sell off the Atkinson family&rsquo;s properties and businesses at a low price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;The problem now is that Jason is so swift and brutal that I have no way of fighting off his tactics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;If this goes on, the Atkinson family&rsquo;s business is going to plummet.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look for Lily to discuss this. She&rsquo;s now the daughter-in-law of the Stevens family, so we&rsquo;re essentially the same family. Let&rsquo;s get her to speak to them to get the Stevens family to help us!&rdquo;</p></div>
