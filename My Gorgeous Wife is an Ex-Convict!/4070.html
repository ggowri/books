        <h1>Chapter 4068</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I thought you liked Chandler!" Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I do appreciate him, but that's a different matter," Hadwin replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But honey, Tina's not home tonight. Why don't we have some fun later?" Lina's eyes scanned her husband with "passion".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When her daughter left today, the bag of clothes she took with her reminded her that she and her husband hadn't played COS together much lately. So she had ordered some costumes and headgear from the same TV shows and movies through a local courier, which should arrive soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She would put on a beautiful makeup for her husband later... Thinking of this, Lina's "anticipation" for the night became even stronger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> ...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> On the other side, Chandler was stunned when he returned to his residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Standing in front of him was Tina, dressed in men's clothing, with short hair, looking like a delicate young man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Did you cut your hair?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No, it's a wig," Tina replied, then walked up to Chandler, "What do you think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Is this your next COS style?" he asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No, it's something special I wanted to show you," Tina raised her hands and wrapped them around Chandler's neck, "Do you like me like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He squinted his eyes, "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you like me the way I am now or my usual self?" She asked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the distance between the two was very close. Her breath sprayed lightly on his face, carrying a sweet scent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his mind flashed the memory of that night, when she was pressed against his body and his lips showered her with kisses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her moans, her breaths, and her reluctance...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Chandler's face turned red, feeling a certain reaction in his body, as if his blood was converging in one place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I'll go back to my room and change my clothes. Wait for me here," Chandler said, pushing Tina away and intending to go upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Tina grabbed Chandler's hand first. "Your face is red, do you have a reaction to me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words were so direct, and her dark eyes were looking at him, clear and pure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if she was just innocently asking this question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that moment, Chandler suddenly felt embarrassed. "Let go first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really attracted to men?" she asked surprisingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Chandler didn't react at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you prefer men over women? So when I seduced you in my usual appearance, you had no reaction, but when I dressed like a man, you felt something, right?" Tina asked seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Chandler felt that he had experienced a lot in his life, he was still stunned for a while when faced with Tina's words. It took him a while to come back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I like men?" he said, with a faint blue vein popping on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just...um, a speculation." She said, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she's usually carefree, she could sense that he seemed...upset?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So besides this speculation, do you have any other guesses?" He continued to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's also...sexual frigidity." She said cautiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her, not saying a word.</p></div>
