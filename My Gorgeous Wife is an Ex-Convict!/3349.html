        <h1>Chapter 3347</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it not good that I like the things you like?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I hope you have things that you like, even if they're not things that I like. Things that you enjoy," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want to!" Mason rejected almost without thinking, "If it's not something you like, then I definitely won't like it either!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words were so decisive that it left her at a loss for what to say next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, his stubbornness made her feel helpless, as if once he had made up his mind about something, it was impossible to change it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace, who was not far away, seemed to notice the strange atmosphere between the two children and walked over, asking, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was the first to shake her head and say, "It's nothing, Auntie Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace turned to Veronica and said, "I know you're mature, but if Mason really does something that makes you unhappy, you tell me, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Auntie Grace, really, it's nothing. I just don't want Mason to like something just because I like it. He should have things that he likes on his own," Veronica explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I like something that Auntie doesn't like? I don't want to do that," Mason blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace noticed her son's stubbornness in this regard and understood that Veronica had good intentions. She said to her, "I know you mean well and hope that Mason can become independent, but it's important to take it slow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm," Veronica nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, Grace told Jason about what happened between Veronica and Mason today in the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You tell me, what should we do if Mason continues like this? The child is too attached to Veronica," Grace said with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's actually not a big deal, as long as Veronica ends up with Mason in the future," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That also depends on whether Veronica likes Mason. But if Veronica only sees Mason as a younger brother and has no romantic feelings towards him, then what should we do?" Grace said, expressing her biggest concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If that's really the case, then let Veronica fall in love with Mason," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace felt overwhelmed. "When it comes to matters of the heart, you can't just fall in love at will. If emotions could be easily controlled by our willpower, there wouldn't be so many unattainable things in this world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason is our son. If he truly wants Veronica to be with him for the rest of his life, then he can definitely make Veronica fall in love with him," Jason said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you sure about this?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I'm sure," even if Veronica doesn't love Mason, he will still fulfill his son's wishes in the future. However, he didn't say this to her at the moment because he knew she wouldn't agree even if he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace is different from him. Her heart is full of light, which is why she will become a lawyer. Over the years, she will fight for justice and defend those who have been wronged in court.</p></div>
