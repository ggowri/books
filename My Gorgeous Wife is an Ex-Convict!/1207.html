        <h1>Chapter 1206</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One to two million dollars might be nothing to Brian, but for Lina, it was the money needed to save her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took out her phone and dialed Brian's number, but no one answered. She clenched her teeth and went to Brian's ward at City First Hospital, but it was empty. The news she got from the nurse was that Brian had gone through the discharge formalities this afternoon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Where else? Where else can I find Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's mind kept thinking, 'the Hart family's mansion or Brian's... private mansion?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered Brian mentioning that he usually stayed in his private mansion, and the address of the mansion was... Grace remembered that online gossip news had mentioned the address before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Brian was the crown prince of the entertainment industry. Many people knew where his private mansion was, but it was not easy for just about anyone to enter. After all, it had the best security system in the world and a lot of security guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a taxi and gave the driver Brian's mansion&rsquo;s address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing that, the driver immediately advised, "You're not going to the crown prince's mansion to try your luck, are you? Oh, you'll only get stopped outside. How can ordinary people get in? I advise you not to take any chances."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only said lightly, "Drive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he drove along, the driver rambled on about the women his peers had driven to the mansion. In the end, the security guards there only reported these women to the police for trying to break into the mansion. Then they were hauled off to the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are always women these days who want to try their luck, thinking that once they get into a rich and powerful family, they won't have to struggle anymore. But do they think it's that easy to snag the crown prince? Many beautiful women in the entertainment industry want to snag him as well, let alone ordinary women." The way the driver spoke clearly showed that he had taken Grace for a woman who also wanted to snag Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not explain herself either. Now, all she could think about was Lina's illness!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the first time, she felt how badly she needed money. However, Brian was now the only person with that kind of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only he... would be willing to lend her such a large sum of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sat in the car nervously. She paid the fare and got out quickly when she reached her destination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mansion's iron gates were closed. A security guard approached Grace and questioned her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I need to urgently see Brian," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Hart isn't someone that you can see whenever you want. Go away. Don't make us call the police and report you for harassment," said the security guard as he looked at Grace with some disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he had seen quite a few women coming here wanting to try their luck and snag the crown prince!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s an urgent matter!&rdquo; said Grace. What the security guard said confirmed that Brian was probably here right now. "Help me inform Brian by saying Grace wants to meet him. He'll see me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the security guard was unmoved. If the woman in front of him was the type of woman who wanted to approach the crown prince, he would only be asking for trouble if he made the phone call!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no choice but to keep calling Brian on her phone, but all she heard was the busy tone over and over again.</p></div>
