        <h1>Chapter 1352</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, you're really blind! You don't know who really helped you!" Grace could not stand it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not for the fact that there was no substantial evidence of the bone marrow donation and she would inadvertently alert Paisley Daniels if she said it in front of her, she would&rsquo;ve shouted out the truth to Martin Weiss right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was stunned, and he stared at Grace while saying, "Ms. Cummins, I... should call you Mrs. Reed now. But even if you're Jason's wife, it doesn't mean you have the right to criticize me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Martin Weiss without flinching or a trace of fear. "Martin Weiss, one day, you'll find out how wrong you are!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn pulled Grace's arm, worrying that Grace and Martin Weiss would get into a conflict. After all, Grace was pregnant with three babies in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, Grace, you don't need to get so worked up for me. It's not worth it," said Kyla Corbyn as she looked at Martin Weiss lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes no longer had the self-mocking sadness in them. She just appeared as though she was looking at a stranger. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, all I ask is for you to be nicer to Nelson." She had nothing else to ask for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had spent too much love and hatred on this man. She had enough of it now. She did not want to waste any more feelings on this man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn finished speaking and grabbed Grace, saying, "Grace, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla Corbyn and Grace walked out of the store and toward the escalator, Martin Weiss was still staring at Kyla Corbyn's back. His heart was filled with a burst of panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was losing something he did not want to admit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... what were these feelings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels looked up and saw Martin Weiss's grim look. She suppressed her anxiety and told herself, 'Kyla Corbyn is going to die soon. When that day comes, Martin will completely be mine! I have nothing to worry about!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, Grace asked Jason about the evidence of the bone marrow donation again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're looking for the doctors and nurses who handled Kyla Corbyn's bone marrow donation. But it's been a long time, and none of the people I've found so far have any recollection of it. They can't tell whether it was Kyla Corbyn or Paisley Daniels who donated the bone marrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there... any other evidence?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's Shane Currey who was Paisley Daniels's boyfriend at the time. He's a doctor at the hospital and may know something. Besides, he&rsquo;s been in contact with Paisley Daniels again recently," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Contact? What for?" Grace asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not sure, but I'll have someone keep an eye on Shane Currey," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then hurry and look it up! The longer we delay, the more likely Kyla's cancer cells will spread!" said Grace. After all, if Kyla's cancer progressed to a more serious extent, even a liver transplant would not help!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Got it. You're so concerned about her, when are you going to care about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... do care about you!" she said a little guiltily. It seemed she had been so busy with Kyla, Lina, and the three babies recently that she had been paying less attention to him.</p></div>
