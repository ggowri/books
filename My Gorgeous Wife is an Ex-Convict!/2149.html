        <h1>Chapter 2147</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before this, she was always at the mercy of others. She was unable to resist and could only let herself get oppressed by the cruel fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I going to let myself be at someone else's mercy again? Am I going to lose the baby just because of one word from him? And in such a forced and humiliating way?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing the anesthesiologist walking over with the anesthetic, Kyla continued to struggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was unknown where she got the burst of strength but she jerked one hand away from the female nurse suppressing her. Then, her hand fumbled on the operating tray beside the operating table as she grabbed a scalpel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla took the scalpel and waved it randomly, while the doctors and nurses who had been suppressing her gasped and backed away. Kyla was finally temporarily free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She clutched the scalpel tightly in her hand as if it was the only weapon that could protect her unborn child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, it's useless. I've made up my mind when I brought you here today. I don't care whether you want to send me to prison or kill me, but you're going to have this operation!" said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla gasped as she glared at the man not far away. "Why do you have to take things so far? Do you want to make me hate you again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had worked so hard over the years to diminish her hatred for him, but what he did today made her hate him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Agony appeared on Martin Weiss's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Hate. Yes, I already knew that. How could she not hate me for forcing her to have an abortion in such a way?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The more she cared about the baby inside her, the more she would hate him, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He muttered, "Hate me, then. There's no more going back since I've made this decision. I was ready for you to hate me forever when I drove you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would rather she hated him than lose her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." Kyla glared at him as she bit her lip hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You didn't think you could walk out of the operating room with this scalpel, did you? My people are outside the operating room now. You can't go out until you finish the operation today," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Kyla suddenly aimed the scalpel in her hand elsewhere and held it against her neck. "What about now? I can't get out even if I do this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was betting on how much Martin Weiss cared about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's pupils constricted instantly as his eyes stared at the scalpel in Kyla's hand. He was afraid that the scalpel would cut her neck and make her bleed if it went a little further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, ask everyone inside and outside the operating room to get out of the way. I want to leave!" shouted Kyla as she brought the scalpel closer to her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The sharp blade instantly cut the skin of her neck, and some blood streamed down her flesh.</p></div>
