        <h1>Chapter 2447</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The speaker was the psychiatrist who had come out of the room with Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was an uproar when everyone heard the words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Amber Mitchell was not mentally ill, the Mitchell family would have forced a healthy person into a hospital as a mentally ill person. They imprisoned her in the hospital for so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was tantamount to torture!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would easily drive a normal person crazy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What nonsense are you talking about? Several well-known doctors confirmed my sister's mental illness!" Louise Mitchell retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The psychiatrist smiled faintly. "Are you questioning my expertise? You can gather a team of leading specialists in psychiatry to evaluate Amber Mitchell again. We can find out if Amber Mitchell is mentally ill then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell instantly found herself in a dilemma when the psychiatrist said that. She could neither say agree nor reject!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... I'll take my sister home and consult a specialist first," said Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Kyla went up to defend Amber Mitchell and said, "She can&rsquo;t go back with you now. The Mitchell family has been keeping her in the hospital as a mental patient. Who knows what will happen to her if she goes back with you? She can stay in the hospital with a dedicated nurse looking after her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm her guardian!" Louise Mitchell stressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said coldly, "She's not mentally ill. She has never been incapable, so she doesn&rsquo;t need a guardian! Or are you taking her back to make her a real mental patient?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, she was like a fighter facing the enemy head-on for her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Louise Mitchell glared at Kyla fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, someone reached out their hand. It was missing a finger. Amber Mitchell held Kyla's drooping hand with some difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze before looking at her. Amber Mitchell's pale face seemed even paler in the hospital lights, but the look in her eyes was not the same as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... not mentally ill. My father, sister, and her mother accused me of being mentally ill and forcibly admitted me into the hospital for various &lsquo;so-called&rsquo; treatments to seize my shares in Mitchell Group. I believe the specialists&rsquo; evaluation will do me justice! At the same time, I refuse to return to the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house with Louise Mitchell. It&rsquo;ll be a prison I can't escape if I go back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said in front of everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cameras kept flashing, and Louise Mitchell's face turned ghastly pale. She knew she could not take Amber Mitchell back with her after Amber Mitchell said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The media would have something on her if she hesitated even a little!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she could only pretend to be aggrieved and said, "What makes you think so, Sis? Dad took over those shares because you were sick, and we always hoped that you would recover. All those years of therapy wouldn't have been in vain if you've recovered. Since you no longer trust us, it's better for you to stay in the hospital first. I'm sure it&rsquo;ll all be sorted out. Sis, we'll always be family, won&rsquo;t we?"</p></div>
