        <h1>Chapter 2948</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda hesitated for a moment. She really didn't want to do it herself. "But...you could also have a male servant help you with that," she said. There were male servants in the villa as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are men safe?" he asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"... " She paused, well, she had to admit that his face was indeed attractive to both men and women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really not want to help me?" Her phoenix-like eyes lifted slightly. When those originally indifferent and distant eyes revealed a look of longing, it seemed as if refusing was a heinous crime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was completely helpless and surrendered completely under his piercing gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Blushing, she wrung out the towel and gently wiped him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Luckily, he was still wearing tight pants, which allowed her to wipe him without having to close her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What's there to be embarrassed about? She said to herself in her mind. In the summer, she had seen men without shirts on before. In the past, during the summer nights, the uncles and older men in the neighborhood liked to walk around in their undershorts with no shirts on. She never blushed then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda continued to wipe Brian's body while doing some mental self-talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was quite cooperative, letting her do whatever she needed to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you shy?" Brian's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Her body suddenly stiffened. "Why do you ask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because from earlier until now, you haven't been able to look at my face." He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her lips. Okay, she really couldn't look at his face, because if she did, it would only make her more confused and unable to concentrate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes...I'm shy." She honestly admitted, speeding up her movements, just wanting to finish this job quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I said that I'm also shy, would you feel more comfortable?" He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was taken aback and suddenly lifted her head, looking at his face in surprise. "You...you're also shy?" How could it be? Someone like him, how could he be shy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And at this moment, his expression is calm, his skin color is normal, and he doesn't look even a little bit embarrassed, okay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you kidding me?" she said, feeling like she had been deceived by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not joking, I'm really shy," he said seriously, then took her hand and placed it on his heart, "Can you feel it? It's beating very fast here..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused for a moment, and with the palm of her hand, she could feel the subtle undulations beneath the skin and bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This feeling can only be sensed when the heart is beating rapidly. It cannot be felt when the heart is calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, what you're saying is... he was telling the truth?!</p></div>
