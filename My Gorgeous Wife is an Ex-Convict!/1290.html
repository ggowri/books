        <h1>Chapter 1289</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason still had a twinge of dread in his heart as he thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the woman was standing right in front of him, he could not stop his heart from fluttering with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace murmured, "Yes, I survived. It's just a pity Jennifer... But we&rsquo;ve found out the real cause of the accident, and it's all over now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was silent. 'The real cause... Actually... she knows nothing.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he dared not explain everything to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a strong sense of justice. How could she tolerate someone who knew the truth but chose to ignore it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? What's that look in your eyes?" Grace asked somewhat strangely. "It's like you've made a mistake and you don't know what to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyelashes fluttered slightly. "What if... I really did make a mistake?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said with a smile, "Then tell the truth, and you'll receive a lighter sentence. Resist it, and you'll suffer a severe punishment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will I get a lighter sentence if I confess?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you try and confess?" she joked. She did not think he had done anything wrong. Even if he did, he would be able to fix it, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, you can tell me if you really have something on your mind. We're already a married couple. Didn't they say a married couple is in the same boat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Grace, I regret the most for not knowing you earlier. If I had known you sooner, I'd surely... have fallen in love with you and wouldn&rsquo;t have let anyone hurt you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not too late," said Grace. The hand pressing against Jason's cheek stroked his head and gently rubbed his hair. 'Mhm... It feels good.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not too late?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's not," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Not too late...' He hoped it was not too late either! He was willing to use everything to care for her and protect her from any more harm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If only he could make up for what he owed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry..." he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was perplexed, not understanding why he said that all of a sudden. "You&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had barely begun speaking when he leaned over and kissed her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mhm... Jay..." He engulfed all her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His kiss was overbearing and restless. It had a desperate longing that was like a wounded animal desperately seeking comfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help responding to his kiss, trying to comfort him and ease all his unease.</p></div>
