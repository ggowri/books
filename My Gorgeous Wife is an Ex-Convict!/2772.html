        <h1>Chapter 2770</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think you might have forgotten the agreement you signed when you came to the Weiss family to take care of me. That agreement stipulated not to disclose the patient's condition, but you disclosed it," Martin Weiss said lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls said, "I'll pay for the penalty, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The penalty?" Martin Weiss peered at her coldly. "Weiss Group's stock price has declined, and Weiss Group had been badly affected. Do you think you can afford the penalty?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls's eyes widened. 'Is... Is Martin Weiss trying to pin all that on me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you can afford it, I can forget it happened," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls immediately shouted. "You can't expect me to pay for this. Even the law won't support it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? Let's see if the law supports it and how many years in prison you&rsquo;ll get!" Martin Weiss said indifferently, but that tone sounded as if he had decided Shana Nicholls's fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls immediately stiffened and began to tremble. "Martin Weiss, you can't do this to me. You brought all of this upon yourself. Who are you to make me pay for it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss only instructed his men like he was not interested, "Call the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Mr. Weiss," the staff member beside him responded and took out a phone to call the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls suddenly lost her temper and said, "Martin Weiss, you're ruthless. You're really ruthless. No wonder two of your women were sent to prison by you. You sent both Kyla and Paisley Daniels to prison. Are you going to send me to prison too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words made Martin Weiss's face darken instantly, and his eyes were filled with a chill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shana Nicholls, who do you think you are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I'm nothing, but Paisley Daniels and Kyla must have meant something!" Shana Nicholls laughed and said, "Martin Weiss, this is how you've hurt one woman after another! You're hurting me too! If you never intended to divorce Kyla in the first place, why did you force Kyla to divorce you and make me think you didn&rsquo;t love Kyla? You gave me the wrong impression and made me think I had a chance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss snapped, "Shut up! Shana Nicholls, you&rsquo;ll never have a chance no matter what I decide. I've never had any feelings for you. You're just too greedy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha. I'm greedy? What are you, then? A hypocrite?" Shana Nicholls went all out. "Martin Weiss, you still love Kyla but make others think you don't. How could I have misunderstood if you hadn't done that? Martin Weiss, you made me do it. You did this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls's shrill voice rang out in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression turned ghastly as he ordered his men to take Shana Nicholls away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The vast mansion's living room became quiet again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so quiet that she could almost hear his own heartbeat. Shana Nicholls's last words echoed almost repeatedly in his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin Weiss, you still love Kyla but make others think you don't...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'You still love...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No way. There's no way I still love Kyla! I've been hypnotized, and the hypnosis hasn't been undone, so my dormant feelings haven't been restored.'</p></div>
