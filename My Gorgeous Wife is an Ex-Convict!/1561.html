        <h1>Chapter 1559</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not believe what she said but was kissing her. What was this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She tried to end the kiss, but he only continued. When she turned her head away, his fingers grabbed her jaw, forcing her to continue the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His tongue penetrated her mouth, tasting her sweetness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not until Grace felt suffocated that Jason finally drew back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Something seemed to twinkle in his dark eyes. "Let&rsquo;s see if I really love you as much as you say I do&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His voice was now hoarse and intensely sensual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was gasping. Her face was red from the kiss earlier, and the desire in his eyes made her face even redder. She unconsciously tensed up, knowing exactly what he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He felt the tension in her body at once. "Are you unwilling? So you don't love me that much, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His lashes quivered a little, and he closed his eyes. The air seemed to freeze at this instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly. She could feel the change in his body. His scent was more intense than usual. Even his breathing was a little disordered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he opened his eyes again, the desire in them was visibly suppressed. "If you don't love me that much, then stop talking about how much I loved you in the past and how you&rsquo;ll continue to love me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said coldly and prepared to straighten up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace suddenly had a feeling that she would regret it if she left without doing anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wrapped her arms around his neck first, stopping him from getting up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm not unwilling," she said to him as she pulled him down with her hand. She rolled over, and now she was on top of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His body immediately stiffened, and his eyes looked at her as if he was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you've forgotten, then let me tell you how much you loved me and how much I loved you!" She took a deep breath and unbuttoned her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His desire, which he was trying so hard to suppress, now surged because of her actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you even know what you're doing?" His Adam's apple moved, and his voice was hoarse. The hands at his sides were clenched into fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know," said Grace as she took off her clothes and bent down to gently hold his face in her hands. "Jay, I want you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because she loved him so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes were sparkling as he gasped slightly. Abstinence-like restraint, coldness, and gorgeousness were intersecting. It was a beautiful sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, not all women can afford me. If you want me, then there's no room for regret or backing out," he said hoarsely as if he were giving her a final warning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked at him almost with fascination, just like how she would always be amazed by his beauty and be seduced by him back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Not only did he desire her, but she also desired him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I never planned on regretting or backing out," she muttered as her fingers pulled his bathrobe open...</p></div>
