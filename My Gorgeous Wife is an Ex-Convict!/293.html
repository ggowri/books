        <h1>Chapter 292</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because life had made her more aware of the importance of money?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing her expression, Lina suddenly hugged her. "Grace, I've regretted for years that I didn't help you before. I know clearly that you were wronged, but I couldn&rsquo;t find favorable evidence for you to help you reverse the case,&rdquo; she said, word by word. These words had been buried in her heart for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even when you were in prison, I couldn&rsquo;t do anything except to console you a little when I visited you. I hate this feeling. Now that I have some clues, I&rsquo;ll do anything to help you reverse the case. Don't think too much about other things, and don't think you owe me anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's voice, thick with self-accusation, flooded Grace's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, I might not have survived at all in prison without your frequent visits and earnest devotion to my case. Don't think that your words are an inconsequential consolation. They give me the courage to live," Grace said, hugging her friend back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both women had red eyes now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, they finally recovered. Lina said, "I think I will ask the private detective to carry on collecting information and see if we can find anything useful. Don't alert the witness. Otherwise, he won&rsquo;t admit it even if you went and asked him why he gave a false statement."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and agreed with her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, after three years, she could afford to wait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace collected the materials Lina gave her, Lina said, "I'm driving today. I'll give you a ride home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace showed a hint of hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you still staying at Jason's place?" Lina asked as she realized it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." She pressed her lip a little and felt the part that still ached. That was where Jason had bitten her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long are you going to stay with him?" Lina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know." Grace shrugged with mock relief. "It's not so bad staying there. At least I'm well fed and well treated."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina knew that she could not get a hand in this matter, so she just said, "Let me know if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right," Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They walked toward the parking lot as they talked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait for me here. I'll get the car," Lina told Grace as they stepped out of the elevator. Her car was parked next to the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was walking toward a car not far from the elevator entrance. She took out her car keys at the same time. Just then, a car came toward Lina and stopped in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car stopped just between Grace and Lina, so Grace could not see Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a few seconds later, she heard a startled "Ahhh!" from her best friend and the sound of a car door closing. Then, the black car which had stopped between them passed by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurriedly looks at where her friend had stood moments before. Lina was nowhere to be seen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be that Lina was taken away by the people in the car?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback and instinctively ran after the car in the direction it had left, but there was no way to chase after it now!</p></div>
