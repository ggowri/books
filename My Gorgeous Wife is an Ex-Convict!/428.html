        <h1>Chapter 427</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She&hellip; She actually fell asleep!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake? Would you like to sleep a little longer?&rdquo; Jason&rsquo;s voice sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was startled and looked up at Jason. &ldquo;I...I fell asleep. Why didn&rsquo;t you wake me up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You were sleeping so soundly, so I wanted you to sleep a little longer,&rdquo; Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But, I said I was going to visit Nelson. I overslept&hellip;&rdquo; Grace said as she picked up her phone and checked the time. Fortunately, it had just turned 3 in the afternoon, so it was not too late for her to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still time to go to the hospital, I&rsquo;ll accompany you there right now,&rdquo; Jason said as he got up and put on his coat. Then, he walked toward Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and thought about the way she had slept earlier; it must have messed up her hair. So, she took out the hairbands on her hair and grabbed a handful of hair before hurriedly retying her hair into a ponytail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did it extremely quickly, and the whole action only took her five to six seconds to complete.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason witnessed the whole scene and was slightly stunned. &ldquo;Do you always fix up your hair that fast?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Not really. I used to take half a day to do it and then when I was in prison&hellip;&rdquo; Grace stopped halfway through her sentence. Her past of being in jail was not a fond memory for both of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Jason said dimly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No&hellip; It&rsquo;s nothing. You&rsquo;re not the reason why I was sent to jail,&rdquo; Grace hurriedly responded, trying to resolve the uneasiness at the moment with a relaxed tone. &ldquo;Although life in prison was quite bitter, it still allowed me to see people&rsquo;s true nature. I now know who are the ones that are genuinely kind to me, and the ones who merely have masks on their faces.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, it was possible that she would still be immersed in self-righteous love and affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s eyes darkened imperceptibly. He said to Grace, &ldquo;Are you not afraid that I&rsquo;m also wearing a hypocritical mask in front of you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at Jason for a moment before laughing. &ldquo;I have nothing now. Is there a need for you to wear a mask? If you are, you&rsquo;d have a reason for it. Nevertheless, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any reason for you to do so.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Jason smiled faintly and took her hand as he said, &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know that his biggest goal was for her to love him. He was afraid that once she found out some of his secrets, she would leave him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, he swore he would never let her find out some of the things that had happened. He would bury all of them up&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason arrived at the hospital and found Nelson&rsquo;s ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ward was better than Grace had imagined. It was a single ward, and it was spacious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Nelson seemed to have fallen asleep by the time they arrived at the ward. Thus, Grace placed the toys she had bought specifically for Nelson on the bedside table in hope that Nelson would see them as soon as he opened his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla Corbyn saw that Jason and Grace had come to the ward together, she was slightly taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had always known Jason&rsquo;s name, she had never really seen him. Furthermore, there were almost no photos of Jason online, so it was difficult for ordinary people to know what he looked like.</p></div>
