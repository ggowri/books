        <h1>Chapter 1605</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Yes, he was scared! Even though he cared about the child, he cared more about Grace! If Grace disappeared from his world again, he could hardly imagine how he was going to live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason turned his head almost with difficulty to look at the woman standing two steps away from him. She was equally pale with something glinting in those almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, don't... say yes. Even if he says nothing, I'll... I'll find out where that child is. Don't say yes no matter what, okay... Okay? I beg you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His handsome face was full of fear and unease. That fragile beauty deeply pricked Grace's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had promised herself to never let him show that look of fear and pain again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she was seeing it now. Grace took a deep breath and muttered to Jason, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The &lsquo;okay&rsquo; stunned Jason, and the tears just came spilling out of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She said okay. She said okay... Does this mean she won't disappear before me again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang looked at Grace with disdain and said, "It seems that you're just a selfish woman who's reluctant to give up your glory and wealth in the Reed family for a child!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace walked over, grabbed Jason's face, and gently wiped his tears with a tissue. "Jay, stop crying. Stop crying. I don't know what to do when you cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His tears made her flustered and anxious. She only wanted him to stop crying so he could stop feeling sad, hurt, scared, and uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason let go of Secretary Wang and took Grace's hand. "Are you really not going to disappear? You won't leave me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I won't!" she said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang sneered again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace turned her head and looked at him. "When I returned to Emerald City, I promised Jay that I&rsquo;ll never leave him again, so I can't agree to your condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang's eyes were full of sarcasm, but what Grace said next made his expression change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What she said was... "But I won't become Jay's weakness. I'll become his support and helping hand. I'll never be his weakness and let people use me to threaten him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What makes you so sure you won't be a weakness?" Secretary Wang looked like he had just heard a funny joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Because if there ever comes a time when someone uses me to threaten him, then I'll kill myself," she said. It was what she did back then, and things had not changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She loved him more than her own life. If she faced the same situation again, she thought she would make the same choice as back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang seemed to look at Grace with some shock. Every word the woman said was so powerful. There was an unmatched determination in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if she meant what she said... No, she had kept her word!</p></div>
