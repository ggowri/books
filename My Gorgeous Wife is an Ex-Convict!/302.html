        <h1>Chapter 301</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have any money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for what she had learned over the years, they were even more useless to him. The team of lawyers in Reed Group was more experienced than she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only thing she had now was herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her penniless self was all she had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace dropped her eyes and got down on her knees to kneel before Jason. "I beg you. Take me to see Hadwin Stephenson. I want to see Lina with my own eyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His black eyes stared at her kneeling figure. His face was full of shock and... anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know what you're doing?" He glared at her, his chest heaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew very well that she had pride of her own in her heart. Even when she was ridiculed, she still wanted to maintain her small, trampled dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, she would not have refused him repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was now willing to kneel for Lina, so... did this mean that Lina was more important than her dignity?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she said without hesitation as she lowered her head further. "If you'll bring me to Lina and make sure that Lina is safe, then I'll do whatever you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was the only thing she could give.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her with a look of uneasiness that he did not even notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I refuse?" His voice was as cold as ice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body quivered, then she slowly raised her eyes to look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips tightly and just stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face grew pale, and she took a deep breath. "All right, I see." Then, she got up, turned around, went out of the room, and headed toward the exit of the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she could not strike a deal with the only thing she could trade, then the rest was up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not ask for more because she knew that when people were reluctant to agree to some things, to ask again would only be a disgrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like when she had begged the judge to believe her in court and when she begged those people to let her go in prison...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result... she became a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace reached the door, suddenly a hand grabbed her arm and pulled her out, dragging her all the way to where the car was parked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at Jason, unable to react for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason opened the car door and almost threw Grace into the passenger seat before slamming the door shut. Then, he got behind the wheel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fasten your seat belt," he said, his face livid as he started the car.</p></div>
