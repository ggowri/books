        <h1>Chapter 2752</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She enjoyed coming here. Firstly, the prices were affordable, and she could bargain with the stall owners. Secondly, there would be some unique trinkets every now and then, like commemorative coins or handmade items. She would buy some when she saw them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's car stopped at the parking lot next to the night market. Valda Theller and Brian got out of the car and began to walk around the night market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many couples came to the night market. Valda Theller looked at the couples. They either linked their arms or were holding hands. People could tell they were a couple in one glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What about me... What do Brian and I look like to others?' Valda Theller thought to herself as she glanced down at Brian's hand drooping at the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands were pretty as his fingers were well-defined and slender. They looked just like the fingers of a comic&rsquo;s male protagonist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she felt an urge to hold his hand but was a little timid. What if her touch made him uncomfortable?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" His voice suddenly rang over her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly looked up into his dark phoenix eyes. Her confused face was reflected in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Valda Theller seemed to muster up all her courage as she said, "I want to hold hands with you... Is that okay? We're... a couple now. We'll bond easier if we hold hands..." However, her voice grew quieter as it went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A look of surprise came over his eyes. Then, he came to his senses. "I hadn't thought of that," he said, actively reaching out to hold Valda Theller's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt a pang in her heart as she felt her right hand burn when he held it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He... was holding her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though they had held hands in front of people before when they were pretending to be dating, she had never been so aware of his warmth reaching her body as they held hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some reason, a familiar phrase crossed her mind all of a sudden... 'Grow old together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Can we do that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Can we grow old together?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller held hands with Brian and they strolled around the night market in a daze. She could feel many people's eyes on them. It must be because of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was like a spotlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she heard someone whispering, "This guy is so handsome. He looks just like the crown prince of the entertainment industry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on. Would the crown prince walk around a night market holding a woman's hand?" someone else said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But he does look like him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess they just look alike."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Brian and muttered, "Will anyone recognize you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright if they do," he said nonchalantly.</p></div>
