        <h1>Chapter 103</h1>
        <div><p>Grace maintained the smile and said, &quot;Third Aunt, I quit drinking already. You know that I had a car accident because I was drunk. How could I dare to drink again?&quot;</p><p>Upon hearing Grace&#x27;s words, the third aunt stopped and could only laugh dryly.</p><p>Her uncle said, &quot;Nevertheless, it is Thanksgiving. Just drink a few glasses. You are not driving now anyways.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s right. If you don&#x27;t drink, you are not giving us elders any respect!&quot; Her second uncle followed suit.</p><p>&quot;Enough!&quot; Grandma suddenly shouted, &quot;Your consciences have been eaten by dogs. Are you really going to push Grace into the pit of fire?&quot;</p><p>All of a sudden, no one at the table spoke, but Grace looked at her grandmother in surprise.</p><p>Susie said to Grace, &quot;Grace, your uncle and others are up to no good. They want to marry you to the Miller family&#x27;s fool son in exchange for 300,000 dollars. They...&quot;</p><p>Mr. Kelleigh interrupted her before she could finish her sentence.</p><p>&quot;So what if Grace marries into the Miller family? Are we mistreating her? The Miller family accepted her, even though she had been in jail. Do you think she can marry into a good family now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s right. 300,000 dollars from the Miller family is just enough to buy houses for First Cousin and Second Cousin. Grace, you owe them this. If you hadn&#x27;t been in prison in the first place, they would have already found a good partner.&quot; Stella added fuel to the fire.</p><p>&quot;I won&#x27;t marry anyone!&quot; Grace stood up and coldly looked at the relatives around her. &quot;Even if I were to owe anyone, it would not be you!&quot;</p><p>She said to Susie, &quot;Grandma, I&#x27;ll come to see you next time.&quot; After that, she intended to leave, but she was stopped by her uncles.</p><p>&quot;Why do you want to leave? It&#x27;s not up to you to decide who you marry!&quot; her uncle said ruthlessly.</p><p>Grace looked at her cousins, who were not far away. She remembered that they had played together when they were children and they had had a good relationship with each other.</p><p>&quot;You also want me to marry a fool?&quot;</p><p>Elder Cousin Hogan said, &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s fortunate enough that the Miller family is willing to marry you now. Otherwise, do you think you can find a good family to marry into?&quot;</p><p>On the other hand, her second cousin Marcus shrank a little and said awkwardly, &quot;I... I am getting married. At least I need to have a house. I... I don&#x27;t have any other choice.&quot;</p><p>Grace laughed at herself. In fact, she shouldn&#x27;t have expected anything from her cousins; she just made herself disappointed again. &quot;I won&#x27;t get married!&quot;</p><p>She took a deep breath and shouted at everyone.</p><p>&quot;Slap!&quot; The next moment, Mr. Kelleigh slapped her in the face. &quot;How dare you not listen to us? There&#x27;s no room for you to haggle over this matter!&quot;</p><p>In the VIP ward of the hospital, there was a round table full of exquisite dishes, but only two people were eating them.</p><p>Jason ate in a slow and orderly manner. Old Mr. Reed, who was sitting opposite him, was eating food with the help of a nurse.</p><p></p></div>
