        <h1>Chapter 2963</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson looked at the ice cream in Valda's hand, then at Brian, "Does Uncle Brian really like this ice cream? Then why not buy one for yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson asked seriously, because in his understanding, Uncle Brian was very rich and naturally didn't need to share an ice cream with others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian blushed slightly, then changed the subject, "Are you guys here to play too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson's school art exhibition is being held in the exhibition room over there in this amusement park. With Nelson, I and... Wenming brought Nelson to take a look," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was surprised, "Nelson has an art exhibition? That's amazing, I have to take a good look. Where is the exhibition room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go together, we're going there too," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda replied, then turned to Brian and said, "Brian, let's go see Nelson's painting together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Brian agreed without objection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So the two women with a child walked ahead, while the two men walked side by side behind them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, how is Trista doing now?" Valda asked with concern about Kyla's little daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's doing well. She has a check-up every month and there haven't been any problems. When she gets a little older, she can have a check-up every six months," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking about the near-death experience she had when giving birth to her daughter, she still had lingering fears, but she didn't regret taking such a big risk to have this child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whenever she saw her little daughter smiling at her and calling her "mom" in a baby voice, she felt that everything was worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When can I come over and see Trista?" Valda asked. "I'm so envious that you have two children now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can have children in the future too," Kyla hinted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda blushed a little, then asked about the situation of Nelson's school art exhibition. When she learned that this exhibition was actually a joint effort of several elementary schools, and each school could only select ten paintings, Nelson's painting was one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson is amazing! When I was your age, I loved to draw, but I never had the chance to represent my school in an exhibition," Valda praised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson felt a bit embarrassed by the praise and blushed shyly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt that the child had become even more adorable. With a fair complexion and a youthful face, despite only being in the fifth grade, the child was already 1.5 meters tall. Given Kyla and Martin's height, it is highly likely that the child's height will exceed 180 centimeters in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Valda and Nelson have had little contact, it is clear that this child has been raised well. They are polite, attentive, reserved, and very likable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only flaw, perhaps, is that he wears a hearing aid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, despite any shortcomings, this child Grace is more outstanding than many children of the same age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, Nelson, you're so good at painting. Do you plan on becoming an artist in the future?" asked Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I want to be a lawyer," Nelson said firmly and without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lawyer?" Valda paused for a moment. Usually, children's future aspirations rarely include becoming a lawyer. Most of them want to be teachers, doctors, scientists, painters, musicians, and so on.</p></div>
