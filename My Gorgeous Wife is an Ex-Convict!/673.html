        <h1>Chapter 672</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, she seemed to feel a faint pain in her heart when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After listening to Grace finish her story with Brian and Stella Lindsay, Lina opened her mouth wide, muttering, "This is so dramatic."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the entertainment industry's crown prince had changed one girlfriend after another just to find out that the one he was looking for was her best friend's cousin?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did he grab your arm in the shop?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked him something, but it seemed to be a sensitive topic," said Grace after thinking about it. What puzzled her was why her cousin would say that she told her that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From what she recalled, her cousin never told her about saving a little boy, let alone one who went by the name Bryn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just did not have the time to figure it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, didn't Brian mistake you for the one who saved him when he was little? Tell me. If you were the little girl who saved his life, who would you pick, him or Jason?" Lina asked nosily as she let her imagination run wild.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help thinking about the dream again, but she immediately told herself, 'A dream is just a dream. It's not real. It was Stella who saved Brian.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no such problem. Besides, no matter what happens, I'll always choose Jason," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that you love Jason very much," Lina said ruefully. She had been worried about her best friend's marriage after she was released from prison. After all, there was little tolerance for women in this society, especially women who had been to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Luckily, Grace met Jason and was now getting married! Speaking of which, it seemed that Grace's cousin had met Brian less dramatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace answered softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Although I was once afraid of him, now I know perfectly well that I love him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, Grace said to Jason, "Can we have the wedding a year later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to mourn for your grandmother?" he asked. She did not tell him why, but he could sort of guess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." She nodded, then looked at him and asked again, "Can we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, getting married involved two people. She hoped he would agree with her decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I say no? What would you do?" he asked softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at him helplessly with her clear almond-shaped eyes, not knowing what to say all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lashes dropped gently while his dark eyes were half-closed. "As you said, we'll get married a year later." He had to wait for one more year before she would become Mrs. Reed and he could tie her down with a marriage certificate?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was so eager to make her his completely, but she cared more about her grandmother than their wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to hold a unique place in her heart, to have her eyes fixed on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was feeling more and more impatient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, I&rsquo;ll endure it only for one year. After that, I won&rsquo;t let you put it off any longer no matter what." He made a proviso.</p></div>
