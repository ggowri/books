        <h1>Chapter 1751</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow said somewhat timidly, "Will the kidnappers ask for a lot of money? On TV, kidnappers kidnap children for money. If... If you don't have enough money, I can give you all my money. I... I still have the money my mother gave me. I'll talk to the lawyer. He'll give it to me in advance and then we can save Mason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Enduring the pain, Rosalind Bush said, "They... They have money to spend. Your money is nothing to them! Do you know who they are? Mason is so lucky to have them as parents!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow ignored Rosalind Bush and just looked at Grace earnestly. She did not know who Jason was, nor what status the Reed family had in Emerald City. All she knew was that they were people who were willing to save Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's nose felt sore. She instantly took Veronica Barlow into her arms. "Uncle Reed and I will prepare the money. Don't worry, Veronica."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm sorry... I... I didn't take good care of Mason!" sobbed Veronica Barlow. The girl who had viciously bared her teeth to her stepmother earlier seemed to be revealing her fear and sadness at last. Her little body trembled slightly in Grace's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I should be the one to apologize. I failed to recognize Mason," said Grace. Mason was kidnapped not by chance. They knew that from the fact the kidnappers knew Mason was her and Jay's flesh and blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, the kidnappers had asked the Weiss family for the ransom and not the He family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason was from the Reed family, so he was worth being kidnapped!!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Who is it? Who found out before we did that Mason is our flesh and blood?' Grace suddenly thought of Secretary Wang, who was in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Only Secretary Wang knows where the child is. Did Secretary Wang tell the kidnappers? Are the kidnappers... people Secretary Wang knows?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many questions ran through Grace's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason made Archer Barlow tell him how he previously adopted Mason. It turned out that Archer Barlow was willing to adopt Mason because someone gave him two million dollars to do so. Then, he went to the orphanage and adopted Mason as per the stranger's instructions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That... That man told me to take good care of him and... he said he'd pay me every September. He paid me last year, but he stopped... this year..." Archer Barlow said with a tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason asked for Secretary Wang's photo. At the sight of it, Archer Barlow immediately identified Secretary Wang to be the stranger who paid him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Find out who Secretary Wang has been having contact with over the years!" ordered Jason. He previously had people look up Secretary Wang's whereabouts in recent years but not the people Secretary Wang had been in contact with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The He family's living room was now being utilized as a space to carry out their search.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Archer Barlow and Rosalind Bush watched in horror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Worried and remorseful, Veronica Barlow asked, "Will Mason be in danger? If only I had grabbed his hand. I... I want to help too, aunt Cummins. Tell me, what I can do to save Mason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace hugged Veronica Barlow as she sobbed. "You've done a good job. You're a good sister. Mason is lucky to have a sister like you. Don't worry, Mason will come back safe and sound. I'm sure of it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wanted her son back safe and sound no matter what! She owed that kid so much...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had never even heard the little one, who was in her womb all those years ago, call her &lsquo;Mommy&rsquo;!</p></div>
