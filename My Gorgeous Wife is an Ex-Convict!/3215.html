        <h1>Chapter 3213</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was very happy today because her father told her that he had found the little boy she was looking for and had arranged to meet his parents today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Early in the morning, Jasper picked out her favorite little white dress and paired it with a pair of pink leather shoes. She also wore a pink hair clip on her head, which looked extremely cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you see Lawrence later, don't scare him away," Grace reminded her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper had talent and passion for playing the piano, especially when she met children of the same age who played well. She would be exceptionally enthusiastic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in reality, it was rare to find someone of the same age who played the piano as well as Jasper described.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Previously, Jasper had met some children of the same age who played the piano well, except for William. However, when Jasper eagerly asked them to play another piece, they would play nervously and hesitantly. After they finished playing, Jasper was disappointed and never asked them to play again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, Grace was also curious about the piano of Lawrence Abbott, the child whom her daughter Jasper was looking forward to meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I just don't know if playing in front of Jasper again will disappoint him, especially with this child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand, I won't scare him," pouted Jasper, with hopeful eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you tell William that you're meeting Lawrence today?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes." The little one nodded earnestly. "I also said that I would record a video of Lawrence playing the piano and show it to him later, but he didn't seem very happy about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked puzzled and confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace understands what's going on - William is afraid that Jasper will be taken away by that unfamiliar boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Jasper's personality tends to be easily influenced by his surroundings. If he likes someone's piano, he is likely to develop feelings for that person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, a child's "liking" is different from that of an adult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today you will meet Lawrence. If he is willing to play the piano for you, that would be great. However, if he doesn't want to, you can't force him, okay?" Grace reminded again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper furrowed his brows in hesitation and said, "But I really want to hear it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you really want to, you can't force others," Grace said, rubbing her daughter's black hair. "You were born into the Reed family, and in the eyes of others, you are a little princess. Many people will try to please you, flatter you, and obey your orders, but that's only because of the Reed family. If you lose this halo, everything will be different. If you ignore other people's wishes and force them to help you with something, then you are bullying them. Do you want to be a bully?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My daughter is almost ten years old now, so Grace has started to talk to her about certain things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't want her daughter to become a spoiled brat in the future, even though the Reed family has the capital to allow their daughter to be arrogant. Grace has experienced the feeling of being bullied by someone who abuses their power, so she doesn't want her daughter to give others that same feeling.</p></div>
