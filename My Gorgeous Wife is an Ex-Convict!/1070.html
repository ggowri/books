        <h1>Chapter 1069</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he... helping me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought he would relish in her humiliation and that the more she suffered, the happier he would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other drunk man hit Martin Weiss. Martin Weiss pushed Kyla Corbyn out of his arms. Then, he raised his hand and punched the man hard in his stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Kyla Corbyn knew Martin Weiss was a good fighter. When they were still dating, he would practice with professional fighters. She had seen him in such circumstances several times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she was not worried that he could not beat the drunks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;m just surprised as to why... he&rsquo;s helping me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, the two drunks soon begged for mercy as they sobered up. The next moment, they fled the scene while staggering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss walked up to Kyla Corbyn. "Don't set up your stall here anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought of how she had nearly been harassed earlier. 'Would the two drunks have gotten their way with her if I wasn&rsquo;t here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt strangely sick at the thought of it and even felt that he had been too kind to let the two men go so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn suddenly chuckled. "Are you trying to destroy my life, Mr. Weiss? Is it not enough that you sent those men to give me trouble? This time, you even sent two more men to put on a show and warn them yourself? You might as well not help me. Maybe I would&rsquo;ve learned a more memorable lesson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned. "Paisley didn't send these two men."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In other words, it was Paisley Daniels who sent those troublemakers the other day?" asked Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pursed his thin lips and did not refute, admitting tacitly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's smile broadened, but it was full of bitterness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It&rsquo;s indeed Paisley Daniels's doing. I'm already in such a bad state, yet Paisley Daniels still won't let me go. No... Perhaps it's the man in front of me who refuses to let me go.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then what are you doing here today, Mr. Weiss? Just to warn me to stop setting up my stall?" said Kyla Corbyn. She looked at the time and saw that it was almost time to call it a day. Therefore, she began to pack up the tables and chairs. She put away the dishes and other uncooked ingredients as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at her coldly as she put away the things. "In that case, you'll keep on setting up your stall here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can I survive if I don't set up my stall?" She looked up at him coldly. "I have limited talents. Plus, I've been to prison. It's difficult for me to find a job. I can barely make a living with my cooking. Of course, there should be many ways for you to destroy my life if you want to, Mr. Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt a pang in his heart. He forgot that even though she had been an excellent secretary and was professional, she now had a criminal record. No legitimate company would employ her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had investigated... her life after her release from prison, but now that he thought about it, it was harder than he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I get you a job? Will you stop setting up your stall here?" The words just escaped his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at Martin Weiss in surprise. "Mr. Weiss, are you kidding me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was also wondering why he said that.</p></div>
