        <h1>Chapter 2387</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, you can't... Ah!" With a scream, Kyla gasped and suddenly opened her eyes only to be met with darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was confused between dream and reality for a while until she heard Martin Weiss's voice in her ear. "What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then the lights in the room lit up, and Kyla saw Martin Weiss's face with a touch of eagerness and concern as he approached her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Eagerness and concern. Is he... worried about me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? What seems to be the trouble?" His face grew more worried when he saw her in a daze. He even laid one hand on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla murmured, "I... just had a bad dream. I dreamed of Amber Mitchell... I dreamed that she was tortured and abused in the hospital..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly grabbed his hand and said, "Martin Weiss, I beg you. Let me see Amber Mitchell again as soon as possible. I want to find out what's going on. What she's going through isn't treatment at all. It's abuse!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "I can take you to her as soon as possible and help you find out what's going on, but... it doesn't mean I'm willing to get involved in this. Don't forget. Our initial deal was just that probation for Jacqueline Bowman. I came here with you. We're going back if we can't handle Amber Mitchell's situation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No buts. Kyla, you're not god. You can help with some things, but what about those you can't? Are you going to stay in Deer City forever? Besides, don't forget what matters the most to you right now! You might have to give birth in less than two months! I won't forgive you if you let anything happen to the baby!" Martin Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's expression changed slightly. She opened her mouth as if to say something, but she ended up saying, "Got it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he was worried about was the baby in her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Martin Weiss let Kyla meet Amber Mitchell again, but the meeting this time was more private. He only secretly took Kyla to Amber Mitchell's ward, and for only 15 minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can only take 15 minutes at most. If you took longer than that and got caught by the Mitchell family's spies, it'll probably be harder to see Amber Mitchell in the future. After all, Amber Mitchell's legal guardian now is Louise Mitchell," warned Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell could exercise her rights as a guardian to protect Amber Mitchell from outsiders. She could even transfer Amber Mitchell to another hospital or hide her in a place where they could not find her, which would only cause more trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," answered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'15 minutes? Only 15 minutes to get the answer I'm looking for?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla followed Martin Weiss into the ward, where she saw Amber Mitchell's thin body&mdash;almost skin and bones, curled up in a ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla wanted to rush over but was stopped by Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you have anything to say, stand here and say it. Don't get too close. It's not clear whether she's mentally ill," said Martin Weiss. After all, if Amber Mitchell was mentally ill and attacked, Kyla was in no condition to withstand any aggression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could only stand one meter away from Amber Mitchell and said, "Amber Mitchell, it's me. I'm Kyla. If you're not crazy, would you look up at me? I've had a hard time finding you. I'm still waiting for you to tell me what happened and how you became mentally ill!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla kept talking and shouting. She described everything that had happened in prison just to awaken Amber Mitchell's memory and to remind Amber Mitchell of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not notice Martin Weiss's expression, and the look in his eyes had changed slightly when he heard what had happened in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Time passed little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when Kyla was about to be disappointed, Amber Mitchell slowly looked up at Kyla with those dim eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell!" Kyla was delighted. "Do... do you recognize me? It's been years. I know... I know I'm a little different than I was then, but I brought an old photo with me. You... you can take a look at my photo. And Nelson. Do you remember Nelson? I showed you the photo before!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said as she took out a photo of her holding Nelson, who was only three years old, from her pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she went to see Amber Mitchell after being released from prison, she showed her the photo because she did not bring Nelson with her, and Amber Mitchell said she wanted to see how old Nelson was and what he looked like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the photo, Nelson was smiling innocently&mdash;even though Kyla's eyes had a faint sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla still remembered Amber Mitchell looking at the photo of Nelson for a long time and muttering, "I wonder when I will be a mother. If I have a child, I'll dote on them so much too..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss yanked Kyla's photo from her hand and placed it in front of Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked blankly at the picture, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the time. 15 minutes was almost up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, time's up. We should go. Maybe... she really is mentally ill and can no longer communicate with you like a normal person," Martin Weiss said to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's face was full of reluctance. 'Just leave? '</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss was about to take back the photo, Amber Mitchell's mutilated right hand grasped it with a shudder as tears poured out of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla..." Her lips parted, and her voice was unusually dry and hoarse as if she had not spoken for years, and one had to figure out what she was saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was startled. "Amber Mitchell... Do you... do you remember me? Could you tell me... what's going on? Why were you sent to a mental hospital by your family? Are you really..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice suddenly stopped because Amber Mitchell's lips moved as she struggled to utter, "Save... me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes widened instantly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart was heavy when ahe left the hospital. Amber Mitchell's eyes were... sober when she said, "Save me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The originally dim eyes glimmered faintly because...she saw hope!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was now Amber Mitchell's hope.</p></div>
