        <h1>Chapter 4159 Not Able to Sleep Together</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tonight, you sleep in the room next to mine," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Can't we sleep together?" Tina blinked her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No," Chandler said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Ah? Why not?" Tina looked puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm afraid I won't have that self-control!" he said, rubbing his forehead. "Alright, you rest in the room for now. I'll go to the ancestral hall and pay my respects, and then I'll come back to find you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After saying that, Chandler left first, leaving Tina alone in the room, muttering to herself, "If he doesn't have self-control, then so be it, I don't mind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She looked around the bedroom, which was elegantly decorated. Even the random decorations in the room, in Tina's eyes, were valuable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, there was a sudden knock on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina got up to open the door and was slightly surprised when she saw who was standing at the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was Chandler's mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Auntie, are you looking for Chandler? He just went to the ancestral hall," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Adele looked at Tina and said, "I'm here to find you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A look of surprise flashed in Tina's eyes, as when she had seen Auntie Adele before, her attitude seemed indifferent, and she had even left early, as if she had nothing to say to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you mind having a chat with me?" Adele asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina smiled, "Of course not." Because she was Chandler's mother, even if Adele's attitude towards her was cold, Tina still had a favorable impression of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because that is the person who gave birth to Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I heard some things about you. Although Chandler has been with you since childhood and your relationship has always been good, in this world, people's hearts are the most fickle," Adele said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I disagree with that statement," Tina said. "I don't think people's hearts are the most fickle. Many times, people's hearts are also steadfast, just like my parents. After so many years, they still love each other. I believe they will continue to love each other in the future. I don't think that will change."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But this is a minority," Adele shrugged. "I know Chandler has already told you about the worms on his body. You must also know that the only way to relieve his pain is for you to quickly give birth to his child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I know. After I graduate, I will marry Chandler immediately and have a child," Tina promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Are you really willing to give birth to this child?" Adele asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Of course." No matter who asks this question, no matter how many times, her answer is always the same!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Aren't you afraid that having a child will just be a burden for you? After all, you are still so young, but have been bound by a marriage since childhood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina frowned. Did Auntie say these things to test her feelings for Chandler?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I don't feel that my engagement with Chandler is a burden. On the contrary, I think it's quite good," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Aren't you afraid of Chandler? Don't you think he's like a monster?" Adele further pressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina's frown deepened. "Auntie, do you think Chandler is a monster?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "There are worms in his body!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So what?" Tina said seriously. "That's not what he wants. He even suffers because of it, so I will help him get rid of this pain!"</p></div>
