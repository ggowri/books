        <h1>Chapter 3287</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the people around also noticed this scene, and someone recognized Kering. They immediately shouted, "It's Kering, it's him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And upon hearing this, others gathered around one after another, with many young women even letting out screams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my god, no way, Kering is actually here? Wow, I didn't even notice just now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I regret it so much. I should have looked at this Santa Claus more!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who would have thought that Kering would play Santa Claus!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just now, Kering said he wanted to invite this woman to the movie premiere!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that woman pregnant? And is the man next to her her husband?" Some people began to notice Valda. Although she is already six months pregnant, she is naturally thin and wearing a loose coat, so her belly is not very noticeable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the program staff are stopping the passersby from getting too close, to prevent them from being too enthusiastic about chasing stars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bodyguards who have been following Brian also stepped forward to protect Brian and Valda from being squeezed by the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cameraman who was filming suddenly frowned, and then, as if he had thought of something, exclaimed, "He...he...he is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The host noticed the cameraman's strange behavior and asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is the Crown Prince!" the cameraman whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Crown Prince?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rest of the production team were taken aback. In their minds, there was usually only one person who could be referred to as the "young master", and that was the lord of the Hart family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, everyone's gaze turned towards Brian in unison, and they compared the face in front of them to the photos they had seen online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, the expressions on the faces of the other people also changed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the surrounding passersby, upon hearing the three words "young master", seemed to have realized something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone shouted, "It's Brian! Oh my god, I didn't expect the prince to be interviewed by the production team!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Intentional, right? The production team intentionally invited the prince to do a street interview!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could it be intentional? Can the production team afford to invite a prince? The prince has never appeared on this type of variety show before! If the production team really could invite a prince, wouldn't there be any news online?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">More people started taking out their phones and filming the scene. After all, it's not every day that you get to see a popular young actor and a prince and his wife in the same frame! To make things even more interesting, the prince and his wife were interviewed by the program crew on the street! It was quite a sight to see!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kering looked at the couple in front of him with surprise on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He originally thought the person was just an ordinary passerby, but he didn't expect that they were actually the prince and princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he is also a celebrity in the entertainment industry, he has never seen the prince with his own eyes. Moreover, it is nighttime now, and the lighting on the road is not as bright as during the day, so he didn't recognize him for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, so you are Mr. Hart and Mrs. Hart. Hello!" Kering quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello," said Valda. "My friend really enjoyed the TV series you aired recently. Would you mind if I bring my friend along to the premiere?"</p></div>
