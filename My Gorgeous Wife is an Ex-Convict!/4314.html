        <h1>Chapter 4312 Envy for Parents' Love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley could only awkwardly get out of the car, then watched as Lornell's car drove away directly in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking off the engagement... she never really expected that one day she would have the guts to say those words to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was something that had crossed her mind repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to be afraid, afraid that he would never love her, afraid that one day he would be the one to propose breaking off the engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was she who brought it up first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really admires the love between her mom and dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though her mom has a disability in one leg, her dad still loves her so much. She has heard many people say that her ordinary mom is not worthy of her dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the head of the Hart family, known as the god of the entertainment industry, many women want to flatter and climb up to her dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her dad never pays any attention to those women, his eyes only have her mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley even remembers when she was a child, she once accidentally saw her dad bending over, gently washing her mom's feet, and finally kissing her mom's scarred and limping leg!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dad said that Mom's leg was injured because of him, but Mom said it wasn't true. She just saved someone she wanted to help, and it had nothing to do with Dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the beautiful love between Mom and Dad, she has always longed for it since she was young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, reality has proven that not everyone is lucky enough to have a mutual affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She met someone she liked, but unfortunately, that person didn't feel the same way about her. Maybe she should let go of this relationship, and break off the engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, she can free herself, not just for her own sake, but also for Lornell's sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, she won't have to feel jealous watching others show interest in Lornell while she's still engaged to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jealousy is a terrible emotion that can make someone feel unlike themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, still looking at your fianc&eacute;'s car? He's long gone! It was Lornell who dropped you off at school earlier," a hand patted Harley's shoulder and said to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley turned to look and saw Karen Snee, her college classmate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the two had actually known each other for quite some time. After all, they were both part of the upscale circle in Emerald City. They had a good relationship before and even studied the same major in college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm," Harley responded and walked into the campus together with Karen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does your fianc&eacute;'s family do?" Karen asked curiously. "That car is a limited edition, not something an ordinary family can afford."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And being engaged to the Hart family, it should be a rather extraordinary family, logically speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the upper-class society of Emerald City, there happens to be no Quentin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, Karen hasn't been able to find out much about the Quentin family. She only knows that her friend's fianc&eacute; is a medical student, and everyone in his family is involved in medicine. They can be considered a medical dynasty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, they're doctors," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Quentin family is a member of the Crypt families, and there aren't many people </span><span>who truly know the details about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that it?" Karen blinked her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's it," said Harley, shrugging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, have you been to his house? Where is it?" Karen asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Harley replied, "I haven't been to his house, and I don't know where it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not even once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen looked at her friend in shock and whispered, "You've been engaged to him for so many years, and yet you don't even know where his family is, and you've never been there. It's truly amazing!"</span></p></div>
