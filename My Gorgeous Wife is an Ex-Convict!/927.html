        <h1>Chapter 926</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Martin Weiss was back in the car, he unconsciously touched the place Kyla had just grabbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time she had taken the initiative to grab him ever since they met again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt her hand tremble as she grabbed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when he pulled her fingers from his arm one by one, he could feel the coldness of her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were almost like... the fingers of the dead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop thinking about it!' Martin Weiss closed his eyes and told himself not to think of that woman anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how much that woman pretended to be pitiful, he would let his child acknowledge his family and return to the Weiss family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to find some useful clues as soon as possible, so she deliberately followed the car's route on the night of the accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had earlier published a post online asking if any drivers had caught useful footage on their dashcams along the route that had no surveillance footage on the night the accident took place</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after she published it, no one seemed to respond at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, it had been so long ago. Even if someone's dashcam captured something, it might have already been rewritten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, it was like winning the lottery for this post to be seen by someone who had passed by that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she walked, Grace scanned the road on either side to see if there were any surveillance cameras installed. However, the police had already checked before and confirmed that there was none around the area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace thought about it, she habitually checked the forum where she had posted to see if there were any replies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that someone had responded to her post, saying that they happened to be on the road at the same time that night. They had checked their dashcam as well, and it showed two women getting out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They then asked for Grace's contact information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surprised. 'Am I that lucky to find proof?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she immediately contacted them through a private message and gave them her phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To her surprise, her phone rang in less than a minute. It was an unknown number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace picked it up and heard a stranger's voice. "Are you &lsquo;Always Grace&rsquo;?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Always Grace&rsquo; was Grace's username on the forum.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Are you &lsquo;Looking At The Mountain&rsquo;?" she asked, referring to the driver she had sent a private message to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Where are you? I can give you the dashcam," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm out right now. If it's convenient for you, you can set an appointment and come meet me at the firm," Grace said, giving him the firm's address. "Of course, if you're busy, I can come and see you. Which is more convenient for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm out too. Tell me where you are and I'll send it over. I suppose it's important since you posted it online and said it's urgent," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He&hellip; was so understanding and warm-hearted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was anxious to get her hands on the dashcam, so she gave him her current address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not too far away. I&rsquo;ll reach there in about 10 minutes. Hold on," he said.</p></div>
