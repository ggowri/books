        <h1>Chapter 3887</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? You seem tense," Mason spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her body had stiffened, and he could feel the tension even though he was just holding her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone's watching, so maybe..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You feel embarrassed?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face turned a bit red, clearly he had hit the nail on the head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But why should you feel embarrassed? We're going to be husband and wife, and everyone knows that. Even if we act more intimately, it's only natural, isn't it?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was right, but...she still felt embarrassed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica blinked, once again feeling that Mason was a bit clueless in certain ways, and was definitely different from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He seems to rarely blush or feel shy, and he doesn't care about other people's gazes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that's just him, the him that she has always liked!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her face is red, Veronica doesn't try to retract her feet. Instead, she tries to ignore the gazes around her and lets him continue massaging her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, let the people around them look! She'll just pretend those people don't exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking this way, her gaze naturally becomes more focused on his face. The light falls on his face, making his features more clear and three-dimensional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His long eyelashes cast a shadow on his eyelids because of the way they droop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His straight nose and sexy, pale lips. This is him, only 20 years old, but they're getting married!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's only lived a quarter of his life and is about to embark on the most brilliant part of it. Does he think it's too early to get married?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What will their married life be like in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, they will have their own child. How will their lives change then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, in her eyes, he looks like a child. After all, she often remembers what he was like when he was younger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What kind of father will he be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Also, he seems different today, more mature. Is it because of the light makeup or his hairstyle?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hand couldn't help but stroke his black hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's body suddenly stiffened, and he looked up at her, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, I just suddenly feel like you've grown up," Veronica murmured, "If we hadn't grown up together, I wouldn't have thought of you as a little brother for so long. If we had met in high school, well... maybe I would have fallen in love with you at first sight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe then they wouldn't have gone through such a big circle!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, his appearance really does fit her aesthetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I prefer a slow burn to love at first sight," Mason said, "You once said that love at first sight is just being attracted to someone's looks, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha!" Veronica couldn't help but laugh, it really seemed to be the case!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And I think it's great that I can be your little brother for so many years. And in the future, I'll be your husband, so I'm afraid not many people will have this experience," Mason said seriously.</p></div>
