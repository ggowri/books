        <h1>Chapter 520</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Felicia Kemp also helped by saying, "This woman has no shame. I don't know what she did to cheat Jason. Jason probably doesn't even know that this woman has been to prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lily and Sean heard this, their eyes flashed with surprise. Sean tried to say something, but Lily gave Sean a nudge, implying him not to say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace just felt that there were more and more people looking at her, and many had heard what Tasha Farmer and the rest said earlier. They now looked at her with a mixture of surprise, disdain, and sarcasm. It was as if they were watching a show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed to herself. After all, she could not change what had happened to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not wanting to be laughed at again, Grace turned around and once again tried to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just after she had taken two steps, her body suddenly gave a jolt as she heard a ripping sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around and saw that the hem of her gown had been stepped on by one of Tasha Farmer's high heels. One side of the gown&rsquo;s hem was ripped. If she had not stopped in time, the gown would have been pulled down by the force of Tasha Farmer&rsquo;s shoe, and she would have been even more humiliated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer gave a proud smirk before putting on an act. "Oops, I'm so sorry that I stepped on your gown. How about this? You can have the dress mended and I'll pay for it. However, if you think about it, you probably won't get a chance to wear this kind of gown again. It'll only be a waste of effort mending it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace just looked at Tasha Farmer coldly, and it terrified Tasha Farmer a little. It was as if Grace was not embarrassed at all. Instead, it was Tasha Farmer who felt like a clown while Grace looked like a princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Bah! She&rsquo;s only an ex-convict. What kind of princess is she?' thought Tasha Farmer as she looked at Grace with more hostility and disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elsie Jordan and Felicia Kemp were smiling with their lips closed, obviously having a good laugh at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean had a gleam of pity in his eyes even though he resented Grace for causing the car accident in the first place. After all, the car accident almost affected the Stevens family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the woman he had once loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, with Lily by his side now, he could not do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a figure came into Sean's view. If it was in the past, Sean would have been horrified to see him, but now, he was somehow relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps his appearance was Grace's best guarantee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" a voice rang out, and Grace turned her head to see Jason walking over with Patrick at his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Jason approached, he saw Tasha Farmer's foot on the hem of Grace's torn gown. How could he not understand what had happened? His face immediately darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer saw Jason's darkened face and lamely raised her foot. She was about to say something when Jason raised his hand and swung her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was unsteady on her feet. She staggered a little before falling to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Grace and asked, "What happened?"</p></div>
