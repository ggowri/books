        <h1>Chapter 1171</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I chose to save you. You don't need to feel burdened," said Brian. Those phoenix eyes seemed like they could see through everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a constant burning in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">More than an hour later, Lina also came to the hospital to see Brian. She also told them that the police had checked the car and found that it had indeed been tampered with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The brake would not fail immediately, but it would suddenly fail after a while. There would have been a real accident if not for Brian crashing into them yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that my car&rsquo;s alarm randomly ringing these days may have had something to do with it," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "It's possible. Did the police say anything else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They said they'll continue with the investigation. They'll probably call you and ask you to give your statement," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded, hoping the police could catch the real culprit soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll have someone investigate it too. I'll find the culprit no matter what!" said Brian with a flash of malice in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not let go of anyone who wanted to hurt her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they got out of the hospital, Lina said with a sigh, "Brian's really good to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," Grace replied softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The thing about feelings is that you won't necessarily fall for the one who's nice to you. But Grace... I don't want you to miss out on happiness because you refuse to fall in love again. You deserve the best romance!" Lina said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her best friend's concerned look and smiled gently. She stretched out her arms and hugged her best friend. "Lina, don't worry about me. You've already worried too much about me. I promise you I'll live a good life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina sighed and hugged her back. "You must live a good life so I can be happy too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Definitely," Grace said, assuring her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then two parted at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance. One took the bus while the other took the subway back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Riding the subway, Lina looked at her reflection on the subway&rsquo;s window. The feeling of having survived a disaster was still so intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, she finally somewhat understood how Grace had felt when she got into the car accident previously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two cars that had collided with each other even caught fire shortly after Grace got out. Had Grace got out even a moment later, she would have been burned to death in the car too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Life... was so fragile. It was so fragile that you might leave this world and your loved ones at any time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her parents&rsquo; faces flashed in Lina's mind and then... it was Hadwin Stephenson's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Last night, she could not help calling Hadwin Stephenson. She did not want him to worry, so she thought of keeping it a secret. However, her body had trembled uncontrollably in the dead of night. As soon as she closed her eyes, she saw the scene of when she was about to crash into the sand truck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had given up all hope at the time. She had never felt that way before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had cried her eyes out on the phone. She had stammered something she could no longer remember and eventually fell asleep during the call.</p></div>
