        <h1>Chapter 4118</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you..." Tina gasped, but even though Kit had helped her, if someone had seen the two of them squeezed into such a narrow space, she didn't know what kind of scandal would be spread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why were people chasing after you?" Kit asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hehe..." Tina gave a dry laugh. "Those people seem to have recognized me as the person who was rumored to be with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina didn't need to explain the rest, as Kit already understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait here," Kit said, taking out his phone and dialing a number, then telling the person on the other end their current location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the call ended, Tina couldn't help but ask, "What about you? Aren't you filming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not my turn yet," Kit replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh..." she muttered, then said to him, "Your look is great. If you act well, you'll definitely leave a deep impression on people. Keep it up! I'll support you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The second half of her statement was pure encouragement from a fan to her idol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit had heard these words of encouragement many times before, but hearing them from Tina's mouth gave him a different feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't quite explain why this was different, even to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked around and saw that no one was passing by, so she decided to try to leave through the narrow gap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait a minute," Kit suddenly grabbed her hand. "My people will be here to pick us up soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pick us up?" she asked, confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, what? You'll be stuck here and chased again later?" Kit asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if I stay here with you now and we're discovered, it'll be even harder to explain," she said. They were standing very close to each other, and a slight movement could cause them to touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit pursed his lips tightly. "Are you afraid of being involved in a scandal with me? Because you're afraid your fianc&eacute; will misunderstand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina quickly said, "No, it's not that. Aren't you celebrities afraid of being involved in scandals? It would be detrimental to your career. As for Chandler, he won't misunderstand. He's not the type of person to jump to conclusions!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her words seemed to block something in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spoke so openly about trust and mutual reliance between her and her fianc&eacute;, as if they were completely devoted to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, someone ran over and Tina immediately became nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's my assistant, don't worry," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kit, are you okay?" the person asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine. Where's the thing you brought?" Kit asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, here it is," the assistant said, pulling out a large cloak and glancing at Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina recognized it as a costume prop from the set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit and Tina walked out of the narrow gap and Kit draped the cloak over Tina's head, covering her almost entirely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's this for?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The nanny car is right up ahead. Let's get in first," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Huh? Tina was stunned. She didn't expect Kit's assistant to have brought the nanny car here. When she got in the car with Kit, she still couldn't believe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She...actually got into Kit's nanny car. This is the dream of so many fans!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I still have a few scenes to shoot today. After we're done, I'll take you back," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the car arrived near the filming location, Kit got out of the nanny car and couldn't help but glance at it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did he bring Tina into the car? He could have found a better solution if he didn't want the rumors about them to escalate, but he...</p></div>
