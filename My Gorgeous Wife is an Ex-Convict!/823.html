        <h1>Chapter 822</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They could get the project of a few residential lands at most and design a batch of residential houses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, don't get distracted. Who you're meeting today are the executives of those real estate companies." The director advised Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," said Lina after pulling herself together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When a group of people walked into the hall, Lina suddenly paused and saw a familiar figure&mdash;Lily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This second daughter of the Atkinson family was also the woman who made Grace suffer so much in prison. Lina hated her guts!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lily came from an influential background. Even if she was blacklisted in the entertainment industry, she could always return to the Atkinson family and assume an important position in Atkinson Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily looked stunning in a high-end bespoke suit with her long wavy hair falling on her shoulders. She also had elaborate makeup on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A group of people seemed to gather around Lily, chatting with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director standing next to Lina had a big smile on his face and went up to greet Lily warmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did Lina find out that Lily was attending the auction on behalf of the Atkinson family's real estate company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her identity, many people wanted to curry favor with her. If the Atkinson family won the auction, it would be a year's worth of work for any design firm if they got the project!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina listened as the normally solemn director flattered Lily with a smile. She gathered from their conversation that Atkinson Group was hell-bent on winning the most popular plot in this auction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've heard about you. It may not be impossible for us to collaborate, but..." Lily's voice faltered, then she looked at Lina. "Since you wish to deal with me, you should know my likes and dislikes, Director Tong. What am I supposed to make of you by bringing in an employee I don't like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Director Tong was stunned. "Do you mean... Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? I don't know her name, but she irritates me." Lily gave Lina a look of contempt. She did not know her name, but she did know that this woman was Grace's friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace was in prison, this woman had helped her a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it wasn't for Grace, how could I have been forced to quit the entertainment industry?' Lily's heart was filled with hatred as she thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was afraid to go after Grace, so she could only go after the woman in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Director Tong, people like her are like cockroaches in the gutter. It's hard to think that you can undertake any big projects with such staff," said Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, everyone around them looked at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Others who were trying to curry favor with Lily said, "How could you let such a person in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone even shouted for the security guards to kick Lina out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Director Tong wanted to defend Lina, but there were too many people trying to please Lily that it was useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One even pointed at Lina and said, "Get out. This is not the place for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina raised her chin. Even if she was embarrassed, she did not want to give in. "Why should I get out? This isn't the Atkinson family's turf!"</p></div>
