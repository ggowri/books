        <h1>Chapter 524</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason felt as if he had once again been pricked in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a shame for the gown though. I only wore it once and it's now ripped," Grace said with regret. Even if the gown could be repaired, it would take a lot of work to mend it because it was of high quality and now had such a big tear in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll buy you a new one as long as you're all right," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head and said with a smile, "I'm fine. I'm not as fragile as you think."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace&rsquo;s smile made Jason feel even more uncomfortable. Yes. Although she looked thin and frail, she had always been tenacious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having been with her for so many days, Jason understood her adamancy more than anyone. However, because of that, he felt even more guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was his momentary slip that had caused her to arm her delicate body when she need not be so strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry..." Jason said out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was confused. "What are you sorry for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I should have hastened to help you find out the truth about your case and clear your name," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not your fault. What are you apologizing for? I'm glad enough that you're helping me," Grace said sincerely, her eyes full of trust in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Jason muttered. He could not help but lower his head to kiss her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only with this kiss could he confess all his guilt, silently telling her how much he regretted it. He would stand up for her for the incident and make sure that no one dared gossip in front of her in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason kissed Grace deeply and passionately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Grace passively accepted Jason&rsquo;s kiss that made her almost lose her breath, she struggled to remind him that they were outside the banquet hall and that someone would pass by at any moment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, each time she tried to speak, his lips would cover hers and swallow her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so much so that... Grace could hardly say a complete sentence. Not to mention, she almost lost herself in his kiss, nearly becoming spellbound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason slowly opened his eyes and looked to one side. Consequently, he saw Brian and Evelyn exiting the banquet hall from the corner of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, the pair caught sight of Jason and Grace kissing and stopped short!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's pupils constricted and his body stiffened immediately. His hands, which had fallen to his sides, tightened into fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He himself could not understand why even though he had kept on telling himself not to care about Grace, he still did when he saw Grace kissing Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn watched on with jealousy and envy. Despite being Brian's girlfriend, the two had yet to kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Grace and Jason were kissing each other as if there was no one else there. It made Evelyn gnash her teeth with hatred. She did not know what Jason found so attractive about Grace, a woman who had been to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When their kiss finally ended, Grace gasped for air while Jason pressed her face against his chest.</p></div>
