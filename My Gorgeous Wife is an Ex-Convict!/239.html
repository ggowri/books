        <h1>Chapter 238</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No one has been able to find out which brand the scarf and gloves are from. Some say they are handmade customized items from a big brand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Some of Grace's colleagues were talking about it, and she could only listen helplessly. She did not know how her colleagues would feel if they found out that she was the one who made them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, after Claire saw Jason's scarf and gloves, she could not help but mutter, "These gloves look like the ones Grace made before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, Claire had been watching Grace when she knitted the gloves. Grace even asked Claire for help when she was stumped. Claire certainly remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, as soon as she said this, she was laughed at by the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Claire, Grace may know how to knit a pair of gloves, but can they be worn on Jason's hand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jason only wears hand-knitted items by master designers. How can he wear something made by a sanitation service worker?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey, Claire is telling us a joke!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Claire stopped talking and was slightly embarrassed. She only turned to Grace and muttered under her breath, "Grace, those gloves Jason wore last night really look like the ones you knitted. They say the gloves are custom-made by a big brand. As far as I can see, what these big brands made are similar to yours!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was speechless. They were the same, alright?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she got off work in the afternoon, Grace got another call from Jason's driver, saying that Jason had asked him to come and pick her up from work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrified, Grace told the driver to wait 500 meters away from the Sanitation Service Center. She then made her way there while avoiding the others and got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After getting into the car, Grace took a long breath. It would be a burden to her if she had to commute like this every day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she got back to the Reed Residence, Jason had not come back. Uncle Kwan said that Jason had a meeting at the company, so he would come back later and asked Grace to eat first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the huge dinner table, Grace ate alone with a table full of dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although the food was plentiful, there was an indescribable sense of loneliness about sitting alone at such a large table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, she thought of Jason. The media said that Old Master Reed was being hospitalized and recuperating there, which meant that Jason had been eating at a big table like this alone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With this in mind, Grace somehow felt her heart go heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, at the Cummins family's house, Evelyn was absentmindedly eating. "Why are you eating at home these two days? Don't you have to accompany Brian?" Melinda Riley asked as she helped her baby daughter with her food. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">'Accompany?' Evelyn mocked herself. Brian had not called her in the past two days. She even went to Brian's company specifically to look for him but was turned away. She was told that he was busy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian's sudden change of attitude frightened her, and she somewhat figured out it was because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian saw her treating Grace that way, so... Was Brian now angry with her over Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the thought of this, Evelyn was even more confused. She secretly gritted her teeth. How on earth did Grace know Brian?! Why had she not heard from Brian or Grace about this before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You've got to hold on to Brian!" Melinda Riley reminded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's right. Don't be like your sister and make such a big mistake in the end. All your efforts will be in vain then." Tony Cummins also reminded his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tony Cummins was furious at the thought that his eldest daughter's great potential marriage was ruined by a car accident she had previously caused. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could have been the father-in-law of the President of Stevens Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, it was now better. His younger daughter's current boyfriend was the prince of the entertainment industry, Brian! The Hart family was much more formidable than the Stevens family. They were the big boys.</p></div>
