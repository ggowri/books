        <h1>Chapter 1266</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He grabbed the back of Stella&rsquo;s head as he spoke and pressed her hard to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella immediately felt a sharp pain on her forehead. Her head had hit the floor. She tried to lift it, but Brian's hand was pressing firmly on her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know that your greed has ruined my life? Stella, you deserve to die. You deserve to die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... Brian... Believe... Believe me. I'm really the one who saved your life when you were a kid... Don't listen to other people's nonsense..." Stella said as she struggled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly lifted her body again, strangling her neck with his fingers. "Do you think I haven't looked it up? I've looked up everything I needed to. It was never you who saved my life when I was a kid. It was Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's face instantly turned pale, and she shook like a leaf. The man&rsquo;s eyes were now red, and the hatred in them made her heart tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He... figured it out! He knows the truth!' Stella suddenly seemed to understand that no matter how she lied, it would not make a difference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man would never trust her again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her dream of becoming rich was coming to an end! Stella suddenly went hysterical and gave up. "Yes, it wasn't me. It was Grace who saved you, but so what? You're the one who mistook me for her. You're the one who approached me, not the other way around!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you just went along with my mistake and took Grace&rsquo;s identity? How could you do such a thing? How could you let me miss her?" His hatred for her grew stronger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know what it means to snag you? No one would give up such a chance! Besides, I'm not the one who made you miss Grace!" Stella said bitterly. She hated Grace and also hated the man in front of her now. Why did this man give her everything only to ruthlessly take it all away from her now?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't Grace tell you herself that she was the little girl you had been looking for? You didn't believe her either!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I did take her place, but you chose not to believe her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you missed her! Now, she's married to Jason. Haha, you'll never get her..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything she said made his face look grimmer. He immediately closed his five fingers around her neck and Stella's voice suddenly seemed to be stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face turned increasingly red and then bluish. She even stuck out her tongue. It seemed she would stop breathing if he choked her any longer. The others nearby immediately stopped him by saying, "Young Master Hart, there's no need to get your hands dirty for a woman like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian loosened his fingers as if he had come back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella immediately fell to the ground, tears and snot dripping down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian haughtily looked down at the woman he found so disgusting and said in an extremely cold voice, "Yeah, there's no need to get my hands dirty for someone like her. I&rsquo;ll let her stay in jail, never to come out again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was stunned. She thought she had escaped the bullet and would simply return to her small town with nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But now... Does Brian want to put me in jail? And keep me in jail for the rest of my life?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella trembled at the thought of this. 'No, I don't want to lose my freedom! I don't want to spend my life in prison!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... Brian, please forgive me. It's all my fault... It's my fault. Forgive me... Don't put me in jail..." She screamed as she struggled to reach Brian but was stopped by the bodyguards before her hands could touch the leg of his pants.</p></div>
