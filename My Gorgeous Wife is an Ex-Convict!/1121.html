        <h1>Chapter 1120</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mansion would be sealed up. Then all that happened here would be completely sealed in his memories. He would never think of it again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lifted his foot and walked toward the mansion&rsquo;s gates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not come here again! His hopes and despair had taken place in this mansion, and it would only become taboo from now on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how the woman he once called &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; had become taboo!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's visit to the firm somewhat surprised Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Stella had come to Lawyer Carter for some legal advice and to ask Lawyer Carter to help her deal with a defamation dispute, saying she wanted to sue some of the netizens for making malicious comments about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter could not reject the business that came his way, not to mention the price Stella offered was pretty good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After talking about what she wanted to do, Stella said with a smile, "I&rsquo;m commissioning your firm with the case because my cousin Grace works here. I feel like I can give you some business and at the same time, I can feel at ease too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter made a few polite remarks at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Stella was about to leave, Lawyer Carter said, "Grace, why don't you see your cousin out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace responded and walked out of the office with Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, are you okay? I heard from Brian that you're back safe and sound. I'm so happy for you," said Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her cousin coldly. She did not believe what she said. Her cousin had probably hoped she could not come back. "Sis, I'm surprised you came to my office to commission a case," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's so surprising about it? We're relatives. Of course, I'm going to give my family business," Stella said, looking like a good sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, Grace admired her. They had fallen out, but her cousin could still behave like nothing had happened and act like they were intimate sisters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Family?" Grace asked lightly, her eyes gazing intently at Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of... Of course..." Her gaze made Stella feel somewhat guilty. Seeing that the elevator had come, she immediately said, "I gotta go. I'll contact you next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, the elevator doors opened and Stella almost hurried into the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched the elevator doors close slowly. Family&hellip; Her cousin had probably never thought of her as family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She&hellip; probably no longer had a home!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella walked out of the office building and was about to go to her car in the parking lot when a figure suddenly grabbed her from behind. "You've been living a good life, I see. It's a pity I divorced you back then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella knew it was her ex-husband Robert Brewer when she heard the voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His name was so tacky and was not as nice as Brian's name. Not to mention how much Robert Brewer's appearance and family background differed from Brian's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella broke free from Robert Brewer's arms and turned to look at him with disgust in her eyes. "Didn't I give you the money you asked for last time? What more do you want?"</p></div>
