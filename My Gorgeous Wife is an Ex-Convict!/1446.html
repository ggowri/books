        <h1>Chapter 1445</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, what are you doing here?" asked Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss told me about it." Grace walked closer, took a deep breath, and said, "Kyla, have the operation. It's your last chance. If you give it up, there's really no way for you to recover from your illness.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace!" Kyla Corbyn started to panic, fearing that Nelson would find out about her illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace had deliberately said it in front of her child in hopes that Kyla Corbyn would take the gamble for Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla, I know these few months are precious to you. You're afraid that once you take the bet, you won't even have these few months, but... if you win, you&rsquo;ll be able to watch Nelson grow up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As she spoke, Grace paused and touched her bulging belly. "It's like how I'm gambling too. Maybe it would've been safer if I had chosen a fetal reduction, but as a mother, it's hard to give up any of my three children. So I decided to take a gamble for the kids."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla, you have to take a gamble for yourself too. If you miss this opportunity, don't you think Nelson will resent you when he grows up? He'll resent you for not taking the bet and leaving him so soon. You have nothing to lose by betting a few months against several decades!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn trembled and looked at her bewildered son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Will he? Will Nelson resent me in the future?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one could not quite understand what the adults were saying, but he did understand one thing. "Mommy, I don't want you to leave me. I want to grow up with you. I... I'll grow up soon, and I can protect you when I grow up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn immediately burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one quickly climbed into bed and wiped away her tears with his tender little hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Martin Weiss suddenly pushed the ward door open and walked in. "I... I want to talk to Kyla alone. Is that alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The people in the ward were stunned, and the little one seemed like he was ready to confront an enemy. Although his father had sent his mother to the hospital, he was still afraid that he would hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With tears still in her eyes, Kyla Corbyn looked at Martin Weiss who was standing not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It had never occurred to her that she would be far more involved with this man than she previously imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She hesitated for a moment before finally saying, "Mom, Grace, why don't you take Nelson out? I'll talk to him alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm not going out. I want to protect Mommy," Nelson said as he widened his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn rubbed her son's little head. "Keep guard outside the ward. I'll call for you if I'm in danger. Then you can come in and protect me, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Nelson Corbyn was a smart and precocious child, he was only four years old, after all. After hearing what his mother said, he thought it made sense after giving it some thought so he nodded his little head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The group of people walked out of the ward. Only Kyla Corbyn and Martin Weiss were left in the huge ward now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss stood a little awkwardly, finding himself feeling uneasy under her gaze. It was as if he was about to be executed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How long has it been since I felt this way?'</p></div>
