        <h1>Chapter 1453</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The mourning hall was brightly lit up. The candle had to be lit for three days and they had to keep the incense burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace walked into the mourning hall and only saw Jason standing inside with the light falling on him, intertwining with the shadows. He was looking at Old Master Reed who was lying in the ice coffin, wearing graveclothes. Jason&rsquo;s handsome face was expressionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay," Grace called out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only then did he seem to come back to his senses. He turned to look at her. "Didn't I tell you that you don&rsquo;t have to come here as much? I can take care of things here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I came because I wanted to see you," said Grace as she approached Jason, raising her hand to touch his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was already early January, and the weather was getting colder and colder. However, the mourning hall did not have a heater. Therefore, although it was indoors, it was still cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was colder here, especially at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you going to stay here tonight?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He muttered, "Since he brought me up, I'll still do what I have to do. Tomorrow is the old master's funeral and it&rsquo;ll be crowded. You don&rsquo;t need to come since it's inconvenient for you with your current state."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "I'm not going to deliver the babies yet, and it's not too inconvenient for me to come for Grandpa's funeral. I'll come tomorrow. I'll let you know if I don't feel well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together a little. "Grandpa wasn't kind to you. Why do you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "There's no particular reason. It's because he was your grandfather and your family. So even if he didn't like me and didn't really accept me even till the end, I still want to see him off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'There's no other reason. It's only because Old Master Reed raised Jay!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason gently held Grace's hand. "Don't worry about what Grandpa said in the end. He was just... Just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know. He didn&rsquo;t believe that someone being so deeply in love will do them any good. Because of what happened with your great-grandfather and your great-grandmother as well as your father, he... was afraid that you'd end up in an unfortunate situation too," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he first took her to the Reed family's old manor, she had been deeply impressed by the story he told her about the long blood-stained sword.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she learned that it was the story of his great-grandfather and great-grandmother, the shock remained in her heart until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His great-grandmother had killed his great-grandfather and raised his grandfather in the old manor by herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could almost imagine that growing up in such an environment, Old Master Reed probably had no expectations for love but only fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe... Old Master Reed had never loved anyone his whole life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Come to think of it, Grandpa was probably worried about you that he said that on his deathbed," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really? Was he... worried about me?" He seemed to sneer. Out of the corners of his eyes, he glanced at Old Master Reed who was in the ice coffin. Then, he slowly looked down and rested his head gently on Grace's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You were the only family he had left. He still had familial affection for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But he cares more about the rise and fall of the Reed family than the so-called familial affection," muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Maybe everyone cares about different things. Just like empires and beautiful women. Some people love the empire, while some love the beautiful woman. Whatever love it is, it&rsquo;s not necessarily wrong," said Grace after pondering over it for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jay looked like a lonely child to her right now.</p></div>
