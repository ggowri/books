        <h1>Chapter 1448</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps subconsciously, he hoped that when Grace found out about the truth one day, someone would give him a hand too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn recovered well after the surgery. After two days in the ICU, she was transferred to an ordinary ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though the transplant was successful, she still needed regular medical follow-ups.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every time Kyla Corbyn saw the surgical scar on her upper abdomen while the nurse changed her dressing, mixed emotions surged up in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how unwilling she was, the liver in her body was eventually changed to Martin Weiss's!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... maybe she could survive. Perhaps she could keep living so that her mother did not have to go through the tragedy of losing her daughter and watch Nelson grow up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Nelson and Mrs. Corbyn had nervously stayed with Kyla Corbyn in the hospital these days. Grace would come to the hospital to visit Kyla Corbyn from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm really embarrassed to let you worry about me when you're heavily pregnant," Kyla Corbyn said apologetically. Grace should be resting well but she would come to the hospital every other day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla, what are you talking about? If I get into trouble one day, I believe you'll try your best to help me too," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Nelson was a little sleepy now, so Mrs. Corbyn carried Nelson to the VIP wards&rsquo; visitor area and coaxed Nelson to sleep. Only Grace and Kyla Corbyn were left in the ward now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace hesitated for a moment before looking at Kyla Corbyn and saying, "I heard from Jay that Martin Weiss will walk to your ward&rsquo;s door as soon as he can get out of bed these two days. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip; he doesn&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn said lightly, "It's the end of us. He'll return to the Weiss family and I'll stay in Emerald City. We'll have nothing to do with each other. If he has some fatherly affection for Nelson, he should treat Nelson well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is it really over?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn asked, "Will you ever love someone who has hurt you again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I once loved him so much that I thought I could sacrifice myself for him, but human feelings aren't permanent. I once thought my feelings for him would never change no matter what happened, but they did. I don't love him at all now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn said calmly. It was as if all the love and hatred had faded now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She once had both love and hatred for Martin Weiss, but it all meant nothing to her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, I can't accept someone who has hurt me before. No matter how much they regret it and no matter how much they do for me in the future, I can't accept them. Because just looking at their face reminds me of everything that has happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said faintly, "I don't love him and I can stop hating him, but I can't forget about what he has done." The pain seemed to have been imprinted into her bones and blood; she could not erase nor forget it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace sighed and said, "I understand that it's hard to accept someone who has hurt you. After all, it's not like you can regard those traumas as non-existent when they regret it later on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"By the way, what about Lina? How is she doing? I've had so much going on these days that I haven't been to the hospital to see her," asked Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace smiled a little at the mention of her best friend. "Lina is much better now and is recovering day by day. The doctor said that if nothing goes wrong, she can discharge after spending another ten days or so in the hospital."</p></div>
