        <h1>Chapter 496</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told him everything&mdash;from how she was harassed by her male colleague and got misunderstood, to how she got into a fight and went to the police station, and finally, how she needed to be bailed out. She said everything in one go, so her throat was parched by the time she was finished. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin listened with his brows furrowed. His handsome face was frosted with a layer of ice. Nobody could guess what was going through his mind right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Lina finished, he said, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you call me when something happened to you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I... I was afraid that I&rsquo;d disturb you. You&rsquo;re busy with work. I was only caught up with a small matter.&rdquo; Lina coaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin stared at Lina until she felt guilty inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some time, he said, &ldquo;Only because you&rsquo;re afraid of disturbing me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said with a guilty conscience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his lips and said nothing. Both of them stood there and stared at each other without saying a word. Lina complained inwardly, wondering how long more would Hadwin want to stare at her while they were still at the housing estate compound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t he supposed to be happy that I didn&rsquo;t disturb him when I got into trouble? Why does he look as if I owe him a huge sum?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He suddenly grabbed her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; She was dumbfounded and stared blankly at him. &ldquo;To where?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;To your house. You&rsquo;re not expecting me to stand here for an eternity, are you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She held her breath. If he went to her house... &ldquo;Can you keep what happened today a secret from my parents?&rdquo; Otherwise, regardless if she was right or wrong, her parents were going to nag at her till her ears bled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly scoffed and stared at her with his black eyes. &ldquo;Lina, why should I help you hide it from your parents?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re my boyfriend!&rdquo; she said without thinking but immediately realized that something was amiss. Both of them understood what was the real deal about this &lsquo;boyfriend&rsquo; thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;So you do realize that I&rsquo;m your boyfriend?&rdquo; He stepped closer to her. &ldquo;Yet when something happened, you didn&rsquo;t look for this boyfriend of yours? As your boyfriend, I was the last to know about what happened to you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She inadvertently stepped backward, but the more she reversed, the nearer he came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She continued to excuse herself. &ldquo;I said that I was afraid of disturbing you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He scoffed at her. &ldquo;Good. Go on with your lies. Come on, what other lies do you want to concoct for me to hear? You can tell me all of them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;When did I lie... AHH!&rdquo; She suddenly screamed. Her foot accidentally tripped on the steps behind her and her whole body fell backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to fall onto the stairs, her wrist was suddenly pulled by a force the next moment. She ended up flopping into the embrace of a broad chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina&rsquo;s breathing was erratic as her nerves were all wrecked. A familiar scent traveled through her olfactory senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could feel Hadwin&rsquo;s hand wrapped around her waist while she was leaning inside his arms. That moment made her feel extremely safe and secure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt that he was here to take revenge on her, thus he was here to bring her pain. Yes, the person giving her security right now was that same person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was like a huge joke being played on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a voice rang in her ears. &ldquo;Lina, you&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo;</p></div>
