        <h1>Chapter 1834</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's indifference toward Lina made her boil with anger. She lost control of her temper and slapped him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "You just care too much about Lina. Besides, judging from Hadwin Stephenson's behavior, nothing will change even if you slap him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson heard Lina's name, there was immense sadness in his eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In Jason&rsquo;s opinion, it was not that Hadwin Stephenson did not love Lina and dumped her. It was more like Lina had hurt him so badly that he was greatly disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But judging from what Hadwin Stephenson just said, it seems that Lina was the one who caused the problem between them. Lina wants both of them to have nothing to do with each other. Hadwin Stephenson is only doing what she wants. You should ask Lina if you want to find out the answer," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace sighed. "Then I'll wait for Lina to calm down first before asking her..." As they were on the topic, she said with difficulty, "There's no point in asking again. Judging from Hadwin Stephenson's attitude earlier, he doesn't care about Lina at all. Lina might not be happy even if they got back together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Perhaps... it's not that he doesn't care but he cares so much that he was badly hurt," Jason said thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina probably hurt Hadwin Stephenson more," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How is that possible? How could Lina hurt Hadwin Stephenson? Lina is now lying on a hospital bed. We have no idea if she can even keep the baby in her belly!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason did not argue with Grace on this issue and just said, "I'll contact Municipal Women's Hospital and ask them to save the baby in Lina's belly no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, okay," said Grace as she nodded. She only hoped nothing would happen to the baby in Lina's belly. Even though Lina had decided to separate from Hadwin Stephenson, she could feel how much Lina cared about the baby in her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the evening, Grace received a phone call from her mentor, Old Lawyer Watts. He was happy for her upon learning that she had found her missing child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts said on the phone that he wanted to come to Emerald City to see the three children, especially Jasper. Old Lawyer Watts had watched her grow up. He adored her as if she was his own granddaughter. After Grace returned to Emerald City, the old lawyer missed Jasper very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My wife is coming with me," said Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Watts is coming too?" Grace was surprised. After all, it was not easy for Mrs. Watts to walk long distances due to the condition of her leg. Hence, she never liked to go to other places.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, she&rsquo;s been going on about seeing your three children these days and has prepared presents for them," said Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I'll pick you up at the airport!" said Grace. After finishing the call, a pair of arms wrapped around her waist as a soft voice rang in her ear. "Who are you going to pick up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My mentor and his wife are coming to Emerald City. I'm going to pick them up," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll go with you," he said.</p></div>
