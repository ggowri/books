        <h1>Chapter 3727</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was also stunned. She never expected to meet Daniel again in a place like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was her first love, but their relationship back then started off beautifully and ended in a hurried and embarrassing manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current Daniel no longer had the same spirit and vigor that she saw in high school. He was dressed in the uniform of a delivery rider, giving her a feeling of being in a different world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she couldn't help but wonder if she had mistaken him for someone </span><span>else. Was this person really Daniel, or just someone who looked similar?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, do you know him?" Shirley, who was standing next to Veronica, spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica suddenly came back to her senses, but didn't know what to say. The other person also regained their composure, didn't say anything, quickly went to the cashier, picked up the already packed takeout on this side of the counter, and hurriedly walked out of the shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel... didn't call out to her! Veronica didn't know what she was feeling right now. Perhaps the best ending for her and Daniel was to pass by each other like strangers, just like now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, do you really not know that person? You two stared at each other for a long time just now," Shirley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know him. He was my senior in high school," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a simple senior-junior relationship?" Shirley asked. Judging from the way the two of them looked at each other just now, it didn't seem like a simple senior-junior relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... there was some unpleasantness between us before the senior transferred out," Veronica tried to play it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Shirley wasn't the type to dig deeper and didn't ask any more questions. After finishing their meal, the two of them went to the bus stop together. Shirley was going back to school, while Veronica was heading to the talent agency where she worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley's car arrived first, and she waved goodbye to Veronica before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting for a while and seeing her bus arrive, Veronica was about to take out her monthly pass from her bag when an electric bike approached her. The person riding the bike said to Veronica, "Veronica, long time no see. Can we talk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Daniel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica didn't expect Daniel to come back, and it seemed like he had purposely looked for her in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them went to a nearby tree-lined path next to the bus stop, and Daniel parked his electric bike to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a coincidence to meet here," Daniel said. "It's been years since we last saw each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, when you live in the same city, there's always a chance of running into each other," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How have you been?" Daniel asked, looking at Veronica's clothes. She wasn't wearing any designer brands, just some cheap and worn-out clothes, with visible wear and tear on her shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been okay," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Mason not treating you well?" Daniel hesitated to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel quickly added, "I was just wondering if you ended up with him after we broke up. After all, he cared about you a lot, didn't he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I didn't end up with him after we broke up," Veronica said. "And I haven't seen him much in the past few years either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was taken aback. "You didn't end up with him? Does that mean you still have feelings for me...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not about you, it's about some misunderstandings between him and me," Veronica explained. "But recently, we've tried to be together again...um, in a trial relationship, that is."</span></p></div>
