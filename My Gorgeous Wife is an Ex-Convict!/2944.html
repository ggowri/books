        <h1>Chapter 2942</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you awake? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?" Valda Theller asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to me?" Brian Hart felt weak and sweaty all over his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You had a fever last night. The doctor gave you a shot and some IV fluids. Luckily, your fever went down later. The nurse will come to take your temperature in a while," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Were you by my bedside all night?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled shyly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He then noticed their tightly held hands, as if he had realized something. "Did I hold your hand when I had a fever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You seemed to have had a nightmare last night. You kept calling my name and holding my hand. What did you dream about? Did you ask me not to jump?" Valda Theller asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face turned pale, and his gaze fell on their hands. His fingers involuntarily tightened her hand. "I dreamed that you were standing on the edge of a cliff, about to jump. I shouted desperately, ran over to try to catch you, but... it seemed like I couldn't catch anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Recalling that nightmare, he still felt scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many times, people cannot remember what they dreamt about. But this dream was so vivid that he could still remember the despair he felt in the dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No wonder he held her hand and asked her not to jump yesterday. Valda Theller finally understood the meaning of his murmurs last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That was just a dream. I am not the kind of person who cannot face reality. I will not jump off a cliff," she said jokingly, trying to lighten the mood. "Life is beautiful. I still want to draw more good comics and win some awards in China."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" He looked at her seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? It was just your dream, not real," she smiled. "Why would I jump off a cliff if I'm fine?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then promise me that you will never give up your life easily, no matter what happens in the future. Even if you face a huge problem, I will help you solve it. So, please live well!" He looked at her seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression and voice were so sincere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was stunned. This man in front of her seemed to be making a promise, telling her that no matter how many storms she faced in the future, he would come to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian Hart, some things... cannot be said lightly. If I really encounter a huge problem, it may be something you cannot solve. However..." She paused and said seriously, "I can promise you that I will never give up my life easily at any time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I cannot solve the problem, I will try my best to solve it. If I cannot do it, I will find someone who can. There is always a way," Brian Hart said. "I remember the promise you just made. You cannot go back on your word."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why would I go back on my word? Are you so afraid that I will give up my life?" she said casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I am afraid!" he admitted frankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, staring at him with wide eyes, as if she had not expected him to admit it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, I am really afraid that something will happen to you. So, please don't get into trouble," he said, and she... heard the sound of her heart beating wildly.</p></div>
