        <h1>Chapter 1037</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had come to his place yesterday only to see him dance, but her period came and she forgot about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson raised his eyebrows slightly. She had not forgotten about it. "Wanna see?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately nodded non-stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't need me to rub your tummy anymore?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can still rub it after the dance," she said. Her round eyes looked as if they were full of stars&mdash;they were frighteningly bright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was speechless. He stood up helplessly. It looked like he had to satisfy the girl, after all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... "You can only be interested in me, alright?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A hint of guilt flashed across her face. After all... There were so many male celebrities waiting for her! However, in response to the burning look in his eyes, she said immediately, "I promise I'm only appreciating them, and with you, I have other ideas&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was a little torn between tears and laughter by her words, but as she had hoped, he started to pull his collar and dance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I just want her to look at me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I just want her eyes to fix on me alone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'As long as she's happy, I'm willing to do anything&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the servant was almost horrified by what she saw when she came in with a cup of brown sugar ginger tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Mr. Stephenson&hellip; only has a thin shirt left and only one button is left unbuttoned, exposing his alluring chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'On the other hand, Miss Sweeney has two fingers in her mouth and was making a gesture of whistling. Her whistling was stopped by the sound of the door being pushed open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did I... see something I shouldn't have seen?' The servant trembled as she handed the cup of brown sugar ginger tea to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment she got out of the study and closed the door, she faintly heard the people inside saying, "Well... we should lock the door before you start dancing next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Next time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh... Your dancing's pretty good. You look so attractive when you dance. I can't feel the pain in my stomach anymore after watching you dance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you telling me that my dancing helps ease your period cramps?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great minds think alike!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servant closed the door lamely, shutting out all the sound inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It seems that Mr. Stephenson's a different man when he's with Miss Sweeney! He would even&hellip; do a lot of outrageous things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even a servant like me thinks Mr. Stephenson spoils Miss Sweeney!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How envious!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the weekend, Grace planned to go to Dr. Russell's small clinic for her first hand therapy session. However, she did not expect to see Brian as soon as she left home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard from Dr. Russell that you&rsquo;re going to his place for treatment today, so I came to pick you up," said Brian as he opened the car door. "Come on. I'll take you there. I want to see Dr. Russell too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated for a moment before getting into the car.</p></div>
