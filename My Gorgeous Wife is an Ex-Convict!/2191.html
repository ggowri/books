        <h1>Chapter 2189</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the child was Jason's. Although the Reed family was in Emerald City and the Barlow family was in Deer City, which meant the two families did not have anything to do with each other, the Barlow family did not want to offend the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chelsea glared at her son. "Stop saying such things. Look, you frightened the child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow smiled and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chelsea stepped forward and comforted Jasper Reed, saying, "Alright, stop crying. Since you're here to apologize, William will accept your apology. Your parents are coming to pick you up, so go home with them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chelsea just wanted to get rid of the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to grab Jasper Reed, but little one clung to her grandson like taffy. Chelsea only wanted to separate them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she pulled a little harder, Jasper cried louder as if they were going to be parted by death. She shouted, "No, I don't want to part with William. I want to be with William!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It made Chelsea feel awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the Barlow family's servant came and reported, "Mr. Jason and Mrs. Reed from the Reed family are at the entrance. They said they've come to pick up their children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hurry and let them in!" said Chelsea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, the servant quickly left. Moments later, Jason and Grace stepped into the Barlow family's living room and saw their daughter crying miserably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as Jasper saw her parents, she cried harder as she said, "What if William doesn't forgive me? Does that mean I can't be best friends with William anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I never said I won't forgive you." William blushed slightly and wiped away the tears on Jasper Reed's face in a fluster. He did not like to see her cry. He only wanted to see her smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"R-Really?" Jasper blinked her big almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William nodded quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Jasper finally stopped crying. However, she was a little out of breath as she had been crying so hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace hurried to help her daughter steady her breathing, while Jason said to the three members of the Barlow family, "I'm sorry, Old Master Shen, Old Madam Shen, and Mr. Barlow. My children have caused you trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow said with a half-smile, "They did cause a lot of trouble. Your daughter scattered a lot of money and mung beans in my house today. Several of my servants have taken quite a tumble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper hurriedly said, "It's because they caught me. I... I was scared that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see William again if I was caught!" There was a lump in her throat, so she was stammering a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hurry and apologize to Uncle Barlow, Grandpa Shen, and Grandma Shen!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With eyes swollen from all her crying, the little one said to the three members of the Barlow family, "Grandpa Shen, Grandma Shen, and Uncle Barlow, I'm sorry. I won't do it again. Next time, I'll ring the bell, but you mustn't have people come to catch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"..." The apology left the Barlow family not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After she finished speaking, Jasper took out a box of chocolates from her backpack and an apology card she had written a long time ago. She handed them to William.</p></div>
