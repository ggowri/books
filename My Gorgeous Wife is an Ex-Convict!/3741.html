        <div><span>.</span><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of the date, Mason escorted Veronica back to her residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, it's okay if you don't come to the Stanford University festival. You don't have to force yourself to agree. I'll just find an excuse and tell Jasper that I have something else to do," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't force myself," Mason replied. "Or is it that you don't want to go to the Stanford University festival with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I... really want to," Veronica said, her face blushing slightly again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing Veronica back to her residence, Mason returned to the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he pushed open the door to his room, he saw Jasper sitting inside, obviously waiting for him to come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, are you and Sister Veronica... dating?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason replied calmly, "We're not dating, we're just trying it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying it out?" Jasper was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, trying it out. After all, I hypnotized her, and now I just want to try and see if this feeling can be rekindled," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it is rekindled, will you be with Sister Veronica forever?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will date her, but... no one can guarantee that we will be together forever!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Veronica had also said in his memory, "Mason, I will always be with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, let's always be this good to each other!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, let's always trust each other, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this world, some things are easy to say but so hard to do!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper seemed like she wanted to say something, but hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Do you want to say something?" asked Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if in the future, you and Sister Veronica...will you hypnotize her again?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, once was enough," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, Mason and Veronica met more often, and the Reed family's car would always be waiting at the school gate to pick her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Mason had bought a BMW, but the Reed family's car was naturally not cheap, costing around two million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the various rumors about Veronica, they began to spread more and more wildly in school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some said she was doing compensated dating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some said she was being kept by a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others said she was working at an agency, possibly trying to sell herself to become a star, since the entertainment industry is known for such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for these rumors, Veronica didn't pay much attention to them. After all, since she </span><span>was in elementary school, junior high, high school...because of living with Mason, she had already heard countless rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had even developed immunity to all kinds of gossip, treating them as nothing more than other people's nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Shirley, who had a good relationship with Veronica, was infuriated by these gossips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, aren't you going to clarify things? They're talking about you like that and you're not angry?" Shirley asked.</span></p></div>
