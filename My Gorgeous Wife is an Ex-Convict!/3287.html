        <h1>Chapter 3285</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's do it next time, how about you give me a gift for Christmas next year?" said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence hesitated, unsure whether to agree or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper grabbed his hand and said, "So it's settled then, we pinky promise to exchange Christmas gifts next year!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she hooked her pinky finger with the other person's pinky finger and began to interlock them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence looked at his pinky finger intertwined with the other person's, feeling a bit unsure but also experiencing a happiness that he couldn't quite explain even to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This Christmas is also the first Christmas for Valda and Brian after their marriage. Especially now that Valda is pregnant with a baby, it can be said that this is a Christmas for the family of three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian had also prepared carefully and took Valda to a restaurant she usually likes. After finishing their meal, Valda wanted to take a walk around the area. After all, she hasn't had many opportunities to go out lately, except for her prenatal check-ups. Besides, it was Christmas Day, and the streets were quite lively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, he would agree to any of her requests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them strolled along the road, and the Christmas atmosphere on the street was strong. Along the way, they could see many couples walking hand in hand. Many shops were also holding events, and the staff were dressed in Santa Claus costumes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Valda noticed someone wearing a Santa Claus outfit. Unlike other store employees who were handing out flyers or giving small gifts to passersby, this person seemed to be performing alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This performance is like a silent pantomime that relies on body language to tell a story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person was wearing a Christmas hat and had a fake beard on his face, so it was difficult to see his real appearance. However, Valda found the pantomime performed by the man quite interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the street, the pantomime performed by men doesn't seem to interest many people. Even those who stop to watch for a while eventually leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only Valda and Brian approached, and they kept staring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda asked Brian, "What do you think of his performance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not bad, you have a foundation in performance, you should be someone who makes a living in this field," Brian said with a hint of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you saying that he is an actor?" Valda exclaimed in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It should be, and he should have been in the industry for a few years," said Brian. After all, he is a big shot in this circle and has seen many actors, so he naturally has some insight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they were speaking, the performance of Santa Claus ended. People were passing by, but no one stopped to watch. Just as Santa Claus was feeling disappointed, suddenly, there was applause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked up towards the sound and saw a woman clapping her hands, with a tall man standing beside her. The man looked familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that man also from the entertainment industry?" The man playing Santa Claus thought to himself at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great performance," Valda stepped forward and said, "Your performance was very interesting. Thank you for showing me such a wonderful performance on Christmas."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really...think it's good?" the other person murmured.</p></div>
