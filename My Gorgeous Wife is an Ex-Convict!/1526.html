        <h1>Chapter 1525</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As Terrence was talking, he choked up. "I'm Uncle Klein, your daddy's subordinate. Come, tell me your name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm Jaylee. But Mommy says that I'm going to have to change my name to Jasper Reed," the little girl said with a childish voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jasper&hellip; Just like Little Young Master? As for Jasper&hellip; Jay&hellip; Could it be because of her relationship with Young master Reed? That's why Grace named this child with the word &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had returned but Young master Reed&hellip; He no longer remembered everything that had happened between him and Grace back then. He even claimed Grace's death back then&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The thought of it made Terrence&rsquo;s heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Will Young master Reed remember what happened back then&hellip; after seeing Grace? Will he get through the hardships?!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence had witnessed the love story between Young master Reed and Grace from the very beginning. He knew the entire incident way better than anyone. It was also because of this he knew that it had not been an easy feat for Young master Reed to be together with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, Irene Lynch was glaring at Jasper Reed, who was talking to Terrence, with much hatred. She did not expect this little girl to be Young master Reed's biological daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If that was the case, her daughter, Oriel, would end up having a much more awkward status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Reed family&rsquo;s little young lady was here now. When the time arrived, no one would pay her daughter, who was the fake little young lady, any attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, Irene Lynch felt that this little young lady who had just appeared would be taking everything away from her daughter! What made her even more uneasy was that the things she had been looking forward to&hellip; might end up being snatched away as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Grace's current status was Young master Reed's wife! She even managed to make him burst into tears the moment they met each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With such a person here, it would be an obstacle that would crush her dreams of marrying into an affluent family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment in the backseat of the Bentley, Jason was looking at Grace with a pair of reddened eyes. His hands were grasping onto her wrists tightly. The tears in his eyes kept streaming down and he had no control over them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let go of me, Jay. I can't have a proper talk with you like this!" Grace said. Even though the backseat was spacious, given their current positions, it would make anyone feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why did you come back? Didn't you decide to leave me back then without any hesitation? Why did you come back? And you brought the kid back as well? Why? Is it because you're having a tough time outside, that's why you started missing me?" he questioned sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his cold voice, along with his teary look, made a weird combination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Me&hellip; leaving his side?!' She had yet to regain a part of her memories. She could not recall the reason why she was apart from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With her current memories, she only knew the truth behind the car accident that she was involved in and her imprisonment. Then, she had decided to forgive him and let go of the past grudges. 'However, it seemed like when I decided to forgive him, he didn't believe me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Could it be&hellip; because of this issue? That I ended up leaving his side?! But&hellip; that's impossible! Since I had made up my mind to let go of the past, I wouldn&rsquo;t have a reason to leave his side!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're staying that I was the one who left your side?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Isn't that the case?" he replied in a mocking tone as tears continued streaming down his face. His tears dripped on the back of her hand, which was warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I&hellip; I don't know what's going on. But Jay, it's impossible for me to have left you without any hesitation. There must be&hellip; There must be a reason behind this! Besides, it's not because I&rsquo;m having a tough time outside that I decided to come back looking for you. I just&hellip;&rdquo;</p></div>
