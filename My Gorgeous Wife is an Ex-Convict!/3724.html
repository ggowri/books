        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica turned on the TV and snuggled with Mason on the couch in the living room. Instead of watching live TV, they chose to watch a TV program on demand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any program you want to watch?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," he replied. "What do you usually watch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I usually watch TV dramas because I work at a talent agency. So, I usually watch TV dramas featuring the stars from our company," she said. This way, she could answer any related questions politely and not embarrass herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's watch what you usually watch," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But those TV dramas are mostly romantic. Don't you mind?" she asked, feeling that he wasn't the type to watch romantic dramas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you used to watch those dramas, didn't I watch them with you?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned for a moment, then laughed at herself. Yes, how could she forget? He used to snuggle with her and watch whatever she wanted to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay then," Veronica said, trying to choose a TV drama with less romance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This TV drama was one of the ones she had been following recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she clicked on the TV drama, it started playing from the episode she was going to watch next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica picked up the remote and was about to rewind the TV drama to the first episode, but Mason held her hand and said, "No, let's just continue watching."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But won't you not understand it this way?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her puzzled and said, "Why do I need to understand it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was speechless, remembering the question she had asked him before, "What TV programs do you like to watch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not interested in these." That was his response to her at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like watching?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, I don't like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why do you always have to be by my side when I'm watching?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I like being by your side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His answer was so natural, and that was the reason why he did it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So is he still like that now? Not needing to understand, just because he likes being by her side? Veronica thought to herself, then couldn't help but self-mock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is she thinking? His feelings for her have already hypnotized her. How could there be any liking to be by her side?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she didn't say anything, put down the remote, took some snacks, poured two cups of warm water, placed them on the coffee table, and watched TV dramas with Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed quietly like this, but Veronica's attention was completely focused on the person next to her. Almost all of her attention was on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his voice rang out, "Aren't you watching TV?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" She suddenly came back to her senses, only to realize that her gaze was on his handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, from just now until now, her gaze had not been on the TV drama, but on Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I'm watching now." She said in a panic. As soon as the words came out, she wanted to find a hole to bury herself in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't she saying that she had really been watching him all along?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as her gaze returned to the TV screen, she suddenly felt a sense of petrification.</span></p></div>
