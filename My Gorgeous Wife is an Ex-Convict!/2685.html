        <h1>Chapter 2683</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It did not take long for the police to arrive. There was a police station just a few hundred meters from the film studio, so the police arrived quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They took the extras who beat up Valda Theller and Queenie Mack back to the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, according to the extras, it was all set up by Queenie Mack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack was no longer as arrogant as before. Facing the police who wanted to take her away, she struggled like a shrew and even wanted to hit the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know who I am? If you touch me, forget about staying in the police force!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her threats had no effect. She was even forced into the police car because she refused to cooperate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they were taken away, the place quieted down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director and the producer looked at each other. There was no way they could continue filming at this point. They had to take the day off and figure out a solution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman had mixed feelings right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only found out that it was not fake and that Valda was really being beaten and kicked on set after Estelle Rowe rescued Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had seen something like this before. At the time, he chose to turn a blind eye and escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What about now? How was this any different from the decision he made back then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had watched others do that to her without doing anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly recalled how Valda Theller had resisted and tried to escape earlier. She even looked at him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's heart gave a sudden twitch when he thought of that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How did she feel when she looked at me? Why... Why didn't I argue with the director and tell him to stop? Why did I stop after hearing Barbara Schuman's words?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's face filled with remorse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you feel bad about it?" Barbara Schuman's voice rang in Raymond Bowman's ear. "You don't love Valda Theller that much, after all. It's why you backed out after finding out who Queenie Mack's backer is. At the end of the day, we're the same. We love ourselves more, don't we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman took Raymond Bowman's arm and pressed her delicate body against him as she spoke, "Since we're the same, we might be perfect for each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The same?' Raymond Bowman froze. 'Barbara Schuman and I are the same?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? Okay, okay. Third Hospital? I'll go over right now!" Camille Strickland ran past the two as she spoke on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman immediately grabbed Camille Strickland and asked, "Third Hospital? Is Valda being taken to Third Hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland shook off Raymond Bowman's hand angrily. "So now you care? What have you been doing? You&rsquo;d better stay away from Valda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Camille Strickland turned and hurried away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman planned to follow Camille Strickland, but Barbara Schuman held him by the arm and said, "Don't go, Raymond Bowman. Valda Theller doesn't care about you. Why are you so enthusiastic when you&rsquo;re being given the cold shoulder?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"F*ck off!" Raymond Bowman roared and yanked back his arm. "Barbara Schuman, listen here. You and I will never be the same!"</p></div>
