        <h1>Chapter 3803</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica wasn't surprised that she couldn't convince Daniel to drop the lawsuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she never thought she could persuade him in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone like Daniel, who's been stubborn for so long, can't be convinced with just a few words!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica picked up her phone and looked at the two cat paw keychains hanging from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Mason threw his keychain at her, she eventually hung it on her phone. Although every time she looked at the two keychains, she felt a bitter feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still didn't want to put away or throw away the two keychains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is probably her still reminiscing about this relationship, this short-lived romance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, she couldn't help but smile bitterly. How long will it take for her to let go of her feelings for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One year, two years? Ten years? Or a lifetime?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was thinking, the doorbell suddenly rang. Veronica opened the door and saw her father and stepmother standing outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered the room, Archer smiled at his daughter and said, "You, how come you didn't tell us about your relationship with Mason? As your father, I had to hear this good news from someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepmother Rosalind also chimed in, "That's right. Everyone congratulated your father in person, saying that he had a good daughter. Your father, on the other hand, took a long time to figure out what was going on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica asked and found out that it was a schoolmate's father who happened to have business dealings with her father. Therefore, during a casual conversation, the other party congratulated Archer and also gave the Barlow family a great deal of business at a huge discount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, the reason why the other party gave such a big discount was because they thought Veronica was Mason's girlfriend and that the Barlow family might have a chance to marry into the wealthy Reed family in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at her father and stepmother's smiling faces and simply said, "Mason and I have already broken up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Archer and Rosalind's smiles froze on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?" Archer said incredulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason and I have broken up, so you don't need to think too much about it. Whatever happened in the past is in the past. Don't think you can get any benefits from the Reed family anymore," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't lie to me. How could you break up? Not long ago, he publicly admitted that you were his girlfriend at your school, didn't he?" Archer said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who says that after dating, you have to wait a certain amount of time before breaking up?" Looking at her father's panic-stricken face, Veronica suddenly had an urge to laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then make up with him right away. I don't care why you broke up, make up with him now!" Archer said urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible," Veronica said. Mason's attitude had made it clear that there was no chance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is it impossible? You've had so many years of history together, and now that he's back in the country and with you again, it shows that his feelings for you are extraordinary. Just soften up to him a bit and everything will be fine!" Archer quickly interjected.</span></p></div>
