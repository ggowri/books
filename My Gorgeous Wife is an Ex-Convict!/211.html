        <h1>Chapter 210</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's important," she said confidently. "To me, the truth is more important than anything else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It has been three years since these things happened. Even if there are any evidence or surveillance videos, they&rsquo;d be long gone by now. It's already very difficult to help you reverse the case, let alone find out the truth," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She forced out a smile and understood what he meant. All he wanted to do was to help her reverse the verdict. As for the truth, it did not matter to him. It did not matter why Jennifer Atkinson crashed the car in a suicidal way that day and what Jennifer Atkinson was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no feelings for Jennifer Atkinson at all. Even though Jennifer Atkinson died, to him, it was just a lack of a suitable candidate to marry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, you don't love Jennifer Atkinson at all," she suddenly said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelids drooped slightly. "I never said I loved her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who do you love then?" When she spoke those words, an answer suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, he looked at her in shock. After a while, he calmed down and said, "Who do you want me to love, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly felt that she had asked a silly question. Why did she ask it? Besides, this man treated marriage like a bargain. He probably would not fall in love with anyone in his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, I shouldn't have asked." She furrowed her eyebrows and said, "You don't have to help me reverse my case. I'll take care of it myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would find out the truth in her own way. It might take a long time, but it was not like she had no chance at all, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't?" He stared at her. "Alright, I'll see what you can think of, but if you change your mind and want to reverse the case, you can always call me. I'll help you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you want to help me reverse my verdict?" She looked at him doubtfully. Looking at his expression, she was finally sure that he was not saying it for fun. He would really reverse the case for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that was strange. Ever since she turned him down at the hospital, he would demand something from her in exchange for a favor... "What do you want me to do? Or do I have to promise you anything in exchange for this favor?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are no conditions, nothing to be done. Think of it as my compensation," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Compensation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You ought to be compensated for everything you suffered in prison because of me. Therefore, if you want to reverse the case, you can always do so," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It sounded just like a great temptation to shake her heart which had just made up its mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Reversing the case... Once she reversed the case, that meant she would no longer have a criminal record. It also meant she could get her attorney&rsquo;s license back. She could still be a lawyer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if she could not clear her name completely, how much confidence could she have in court in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, to her amusement, none of her family, relatives, or former colleagues had even tried to reverse her verdict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only friend who ever worked hard for her to reverse the case even said sadly, "Grace, I'm afraid you can't reverse this case at all. No one dares to do so. No lawyer is willing to accept it, let alone find evidence in your favor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this kept her restless in prison. Every time she heard the name of the man she was afraid to the bone, she could not help but tremble. Now, he was saying that he could help her reverse her verdict at any time.</p></div>
