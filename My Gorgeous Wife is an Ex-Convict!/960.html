        <h1>Chapter 959</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I care about you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He came to see me, but he said nothing," she said as she bit her lip. She felt as if he knew everything about her. 'Is he spying on me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Jason whispered as he approached Grace, "I'm curious though. Why didn't you tell him that you were the one who saved him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately stiffened even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand and touched her lips with his fingertips. His elegant voice once again rang like a melodious violin. "Tell me why."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly found her nose a little sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why... Is he asking me this? Does he know that it's because I love him so even though I remember it all now, I still chose to bury those memories?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when Stella took her place, she did not utter a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to upset him, so she severed all ties with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She ridiculously thought she had given him enough security. She never thought that she was not as important as she thought she was. In the end, it turned out that she was only something he could abandon at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you know I didn't?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes darkened. "If you had told him, you wouldn&rsquo;t be coming home alone when I was waiting outside today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had told him, Brian would never let her go home alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head away. "There's nothing to talk about. It's all in the past."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Doesn't it annoy you that your cousin is treating you with that attitude when she's the impostor? If you're annoyed with your cousin, I can help you force her back to square one, even if Brian defends her," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "No thanks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have a soft heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not softhearted," said Grace. 'I'm also disgusted by her behavior, but... After all, we&rsquo;re both Grandma's granddaughters, and she was there for Grandma too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Therefore... let's just say it's for Grandma.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether it was a smart move or not, her cousin would bear the consequences herself. She did not want to interfere!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just don't think it's necessary!" said Grace. Suddenly, she remembered that the soup was still boiling. She wanted to open the lid to check on the soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her fingers accidentally touched the stainless steel part of the edge of the lid. She instantly burned herself and let out a low yelp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the next second, he grabbed her hand and pulled it under the tap to run the cold water over her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry. It's just a burn," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he frowned and continued to let the water wash over her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The soup!" She cried out eagerly. If the soup went on boiling any longer, it would dry up soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're worried about soup at a time like this?" He glared at her sulkily. When he saw her burn herself, it was as if he had been burned too. It hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you ask me to cook three dishes and one soup? If the soup runs dry, I'll have to cook it again later," she said.</p></div>
