        <h1>Chapter 1218</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyelashes fluttered a little as she slowly looked up. Those clear, almond-shaped eyes of hers gazed at the beautiful eyes in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those eyes did not contain the charm and gentleness they had when they were together. It appeared as dark as a frozen night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she and this man would eventually be like two horizons, each returning to their spot and no longer intersecting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now they were intersecting in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were having&hellip; a child together. A child of their blood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she said slowly, "Okay, let's get married!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A black car pulled up to the hospital Lina was admitted to. Terrence respectfully opened the back door and said to Grace, "Miss Cummins, Master Reed said that you shouldn't stay here for too long because you're in poor health and pregnant. Besides, Miss Sweeney's transfer should be completed by tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," said Grace as she walked toward the ICU with Terrence following behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Grace was pregnant with Master Reed's child, who might be the future heir to the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace arrived at the ICU, Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney were still standing outside the glass window. They were looking at their daughter just as she had seen them the last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though they knew their daughter might not even be conscious, they kept staring at her, hoping for a miracle yet fearing that her condition would worsen before the second surgery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their expressions immediately changed when they saw Grace here again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here? Look at what Lina has become. Do you still want to bother her? Your presence only upsets us. Go! Go away!" Mrs. Sweeney cried a little hysterically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been devastated by her daughter's illness and the financial pressures these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Grace again right now was the last straw. All the negative feelings were being vented at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Sweeney shouted as she rushed forward to push Grace away, but she was stopped by Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, I'm Mr. Reed's secretary. Mr. Reed has promised Miss Cummins that he'll bear all of Miss Lina's medical expenses and transfer her to the best neurology hospital in Emerald City. At the same time, we'll invite domestic and foreign specialists to treat Miss Sweeney," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney were stunned when they heard this. They looked at each other. They felt like they had hit the jackpot and were unable to come back to their senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said nothing but walked up to the glass window. She looked through the glass at her best friend who was lying in there with tubes attached to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina... looks the same as the last time I visited her. But if she&rsquo;s in the best hospital and is treated by the best specialists, Lina... should wake up soon and make a good recovery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina, you know what? I'm getting married!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'You once asked me to be your maid of honor, but I didn't know I was going to get married before you. I'll be your bridesmaid when you get married then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Also... I have a baby in my belly. I didn't think I would have children of my own one day. Lina, will you be happy for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought to herself. She thought that Lina would be happy for her if she woke up and knew she was going to be a mother!</p></div>
