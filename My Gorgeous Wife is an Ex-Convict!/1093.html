        <h1>Chapter 1092</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt?" she asked as her hand went to the back of his head. She heard a loud noise earlier. It must have been his head hitting the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she wanted to do was check the back of his head, but she forgot about their situation now. She was on top of him while he was naked to the waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands reached over to touch the back of his head as she lay on top of him, so their bodies clung closer together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He grabbed her wrist, and his hoarse voice rang in her ears. "Would you care about me if I said it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body stiffened slightly, and she noticed how close they were. Her lips barely touched his cheek as soon as she lowered her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at him. "If it hurts, you should contact the outside world immediately and go to the hospital for a check-up instead of enduring it when you have a fever. Jason, you only live once!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly smiled. "You can't bear to let me die, can you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face that was flushing because of his fever looked so stunning with his smile, yet it was so fragile that she could not take her eyes off it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart seemed to ache because of his smile!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, Jason called Terrence and told him about his fever, asking him to bring a thermometer and some fever-reducing medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Terrence brought a doctor along just in case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor examined Jason's condition and prescribed two types of medicine. It was alright if the fever was reduced within two days. If the fever did not subside, he would have to go to the hospital for further examination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned slightly, apparently not wanting to go to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, leave the medicine here. You two can go," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence looked at his boss and then at Grace before sheepishly saying, "Miss Cummins, please take good care of Master Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without waiting for Grace to respond, he hurriedly left with the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless. In the blink of an eye, she and Jason were the only two people left in the huge mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace read the instructions of the two medications given by the doctor and took the amount needed for one dose. She also poured a glass of water and handed it to Jason. "Take your medicine first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He obediently took the medicine and water but did not take them right away. Instead, he looked down at the pills in his hand in some kind of trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really... afraid of taking medicine?" she asked hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent, and just when she thought he would not answer, his voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hate taking medicine. When I first came to the Reed family, a servant in charge of taking care of me secretly changed the vitamin pills I took every day with sleeping pills. Because that way, I would sleep soundly at night and she didn&rsquo;t have to worry about me waking up at night and needing her to take care of me. She could even sneak out on a date with her boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. 'He must&rsquo;ve been young... when he got back to the Reed family. Probably around six or seven years old. It would greatly affect children if they took sleeping pills as vitamin pills for a long time!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew it did not affect him that much, though. Otherwise, he would not be in front of her in good health right now. However, she could not help asking, "What happened afterward? How was it discovered?"</p></div>
