        <h1>Chapter 1305</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as she ate, she suddenly felt like throwing up again. Therefore, she made a gesture and hurried out of the private room, walking quickly toward the restroom at the end of the corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The female bodyguard guarding outside the private room quickly followed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did Jason take out his phone and call Terrence who was dining with the driver in the general dining area outside. "What did you not say in the car earlier?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was surprised. He did not expect Master Reed to have noticed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young Madam was in the car earlier, so there were some things he could not say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They also reported that Hadwin Stephenson and the Jackson family's new heiress seemed very intimate. Moreover, the Jackson family seems to be working on something in secret, possibly to help Hadwin Stephenson regain power."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pondered over it. 'Hadwin Stephenson and the Jackson family's newly appeared true heiress?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't tell Grace about this first, lest she panics and let her imagination run wild. Wait until we can clarify things. Check what on earth is going on between Hadwin Stephenson and that person from the Jackson family first," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Grace finally felt better after throwing up in the restroom for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, she was already more than three months along but the morning sickness had not stopped. She had also looked up some information and consulted doctors, so she knew that morning sickness solely depended on one&rsquo;s body&rsquo;s constitution. Some people would throw up until they gave birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nutrition the children received would lessen due to morning sickness, so she needed to take in more nutrients.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The most direct way to take in nutrition... was by eating!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a wry smile and looked at her still not-so-obvious belly. It seemed she still had to eat more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got out of the restroom, walked toward the private rooms, and pushed the door of one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Madam..." The bodyguard behind her called out, but it was too late. Grace had already pushed the private room door open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately realized she was in the wrong private room. Everyone in the private room looked at Grace at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart sank as she saw the people in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were all acquaintances&mdash;Lily, Sean, and some of Sean's friends. When Grace became Sean's girlfriend, he had also brought her into his circle of friends and she got to know many of his friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the time, his friends would call her their &lsquo;sister-in-law&rsquo;, but it was a big joke now that she thought about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean was stunned when he saw Grace walk in. Speaking of which, he had not seen her for some time. She was thinner than he remembered. The loose long white dress she wore made her look frail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she looked much better than before. Her face was the same, but the lethargy had disappeared, replaced by a bright gentleness and determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had the same light when he first met her. No, it was unlike the sharp light when she showed her talent but a subdued light after precipitation that was much more attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily frowned as she looked at Sean who was staring blankly at Grace. She felt displeased and secretly reached out to tug Sean's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean suddenly came to his senses and met Lily's displeased eyes, feeling a sudden rush of annoyance and embarrassment.</p></div>
