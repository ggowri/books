        <h1>Chapter 1886</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Obviously, the teacher did not want William to stay in the kindergarten. The child was admitted to the kindergarten by the Reed family, but having a child with a mother who committed suicide in the detention center would only affect their reputation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said right away, "I don't think what the kids said was any less harsh than William hitting them. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wrong to fight back when you&rsquo;re insulted either! Also, if you think William isn't fit to be here, I&rsquo;ll transfer the three children to another kindergarten. There will be other kindergartens in Emerald City suitable for them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Grace crouched down and looked at the little one with scars on his face. "I know that you must be in great pain. I'll take you to a doctor later. These wounds will soon heal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William stared blankly at Grace. His pretty eyes widened, and his little face seemed shocked. He was surprised that she would speak up for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In his opinion, the woman in front of him should hate him and be disgusted with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because his mother almost killed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, let's go." Grace took William's hand and headed out of the office with the three children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was then that the teacher came to her senses. 'Did Mrs. Reed say... she's transferring the three children? Does that mean Mick Reed and Jasper are also transferring?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Gosh! If the Reed family's children transfer elsewhere, it&rsquo;ll cause a great uproar in the kindergarten. The director will scold me to death if he finds out!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was just trying to kick William out of the kindergarten. Kids like him did not belong in a kindergarten like theirs! However, who would have thought that Mrs. Reed would be so resolute for the child of a deceased prisoner who once harmed her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The teacher ran out, wanting to change her mind. However, Grace had already gotten in the car with the three children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the car, Jasper blew hard at the injuries on William's face. "It doesn't hurt... It doesn't hurt. Mommy will take you to the doctor soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked at Jasper before looking at Grace. He suddenly said, "I don't have to go to kindergarten."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace smiled. "You can learn a lot of new things and play with other children in kindergarten. Jasper loves going to kindergarten. She even cries when she doesn&rsquo;t have to go on weekends! This time, I'll choose a good kindergarten. The three of you can then go together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William only thought that the smile of the woman before him was so gentle and different from his mother's smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is this... Jasper's mommy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mommy, when will Daddy be back? I want Daddy and Mommy to fetch us to the new kindergarten on our first day! How many more days will he be away on his business trip? I miss Daddy!" mumbled Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed also stared at Grace, clearly wondering when his father would return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace pressed her lips together slightly. She still kept a smile on her face, not wanting her children to sense anything unusual. "I think he'll probably be back in a few days. I'll fetch you to the new kindergarten with Daddy when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper cheered at her assurance, but Mick Reed cautiously asked for confirmation, "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Of course! I wouldn&rsquo;t lie to you!" Grace rubbed her son's tiny head. It was a promise and also a show of her determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had to find Jay no matter what. She had so much to say to Jay! She wanted to tell him how much she loved him and that he had never been a loser in their relationship!</p></div>
