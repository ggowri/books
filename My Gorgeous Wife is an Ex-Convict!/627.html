        <h1>Chapter 626</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered it being sold for hundreds of millions of dollars and joked by asking who would wear such an expensive diamond in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unexpectedly, the diamond now appeared in front of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this... Frozen Heart?" she asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've seen it?" He was slightly surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." She nodded her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to use this diamond for your wedding ring. You can take a look and see what kind of ring setting you like, or you can let the designer design what you want," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A wedding ring?' Grace blinked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A diamond that was worth hundreds of millions of dollars for her wedding ring? Grace only felt that everything seemed unreal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't like it?" He frowned slightly. "If you don't like it, I'll see if there are any other suitable diamonds, or do you like other stones?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" She denied quickly. It was not that she did not like it, it was just... "This diamond is too expensive. Are you really going to use it for a wedding ring?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else?" He suddenly chuckled. Her expression now was a little adorable. "You can use it for a necklace if you want. As for it being expensive..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused, took her right hand in his, leaned down slightly, and kissed the spot on her ring finger where her wedding ring would be placed. "No matter how expensive the ring is, you're good enough for it. You're the woman I, Jason, want to marry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A warm feeling from where he kissed quickly spread through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes watered a little. This was the man she wanted to marry. He gave her the feeling that she was his treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought perhaps agreeing to marry him was the best thing she had ever done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Next, Grace took a look at some of the diamond ring styles available, then she talked to the designer and put forward some ideas. Their first discussion came to an end after a while. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, this kind of design project required a lot of discussions. When it came to wedding rings, the process certainly required a lot more caution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hungry?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," answered Grace as she nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then, let's go to dinner," he said. He took her to a restaurant she had once praised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they were ordering food, Grace discovered that Jason was ordering all her favorite dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was the way he was. He would silently remember her preferences and inadvertently show his attentiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had been afraid of him before, she was now no longer afraid of him. That fear had disappeared with the love he had given her, so to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Follow me to the law firm tomorrow," Jason said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We've gathered enough evidence for your case. I plan to get a lawyer to sort out the materials and file an appeal with the prosecutor general's office. That's why you're following me to the law firm tomorrow," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly stiffened and even stopped breathing for a while. 'Filing an appeal with the prosecutor... Does that mean my case is really getting reversed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Can I clear my name? Can it really wash away the pain, the grievances, and the injustice I&rsquo;ve suffered?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She once thought that she might not be able to reverse the case for the rest of her life and it was just wishful thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now he was telling her that he had gathered enough evidence.</p></div>
