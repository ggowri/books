        <h1>Chapter 1556</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You won't have any stepmothers," said Jason as he pressed his thin lips together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sentence was also equivalent to an answer in disguise. Mick Reed said, "Oh.&rdquo; He lowered his head to continue eating his meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once Jasper knew she would not have a stepmother, the sad look immediately disappeared from her little face. She happily ate dinner with her brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After dinner, Grace played with her two children before helping her son finish his kindergarten homework.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Of course, he did not really need her help. He was far smarter than she thought. She just watched from the side and gave him the material for his homework.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper looked on with interest and asked, "Mommy, when can I go to kindergarten with Brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The procedures are almost done. You can go next week," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one was instantly overjoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Mick Reed finished his homework, Grace let the two children play with each other and went to the study. She was planning to look for Jason and explain about Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, he had not spoken to her during dinner and left right after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if he was... being difficult!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she did not find him in the study when she got there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did he go back to the bedroom?' Grace went to the bedroom again. There was no one in the bedroom, but she heard the sound of water coming from the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He must be taking a bath,' she thought to herself. Therefore, she pulled out a chair and sat down to wait for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she was suddenly stunned when her eyes swept across his room. There was a stack of information on the coffee table, and the photo on them was of her and... Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The information was about her and Brian when they were on the bus five years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had fallen asleep on the bus, and Brian put his hand between her head and the glass window to prevent her from hitting it. It later turned out that someone filmed it and posted it online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was even trending online, but it was very quickly taken down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's eyes fell on a tablet next to the information. She hesitated for a moment before gently touching it with her finger. The screen instantly changed from black to the homepage. However, what showed on the screen was a paused image.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The image was the video filmed on the bus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's hand tapped on the video almost subconsciously and the video began to play. The video had already been viewed for the most part, and there were less than five minutes left in the video that was more than ten minutes long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A touch of uneasiness suddenly surged in Grace's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Brian was just here today, and now Jay is looking at the news and video from that year. Jay didn't misunderstand anything, did he?'</p></div>
