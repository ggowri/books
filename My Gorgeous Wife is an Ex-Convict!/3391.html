        <h1>Chapter 3389</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Four hours later, when the surgery was over, Samir walked out of the operating room and Brian and Valda rushed up to him almost immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Doctor Quentin, how is Harley doing?" Valda asked with a trembling voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's no problem. We've taken care of the head bruising. She should wake up within 24 hours," Lornell said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian and Valda both breathed a sigh of relief, but Valda seemed to lose all her strength. If Brian hadn't been there to support her, she might have collapsed on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at Samir and said, "Thank you. The Hart family will remember this favor from Doctor Quentin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need. I did it for the Quentin family. Your daughter will marry into the Quentin family in the future. The Quentin family will send the engagement letter to the Hart family in a few days," Samir said, then walked straight to Lornell. "I saved the person you wanted me to save, but the words you said cannot be taken lightly. No matter how old you are, if you want to engage with Harley, you can't just back out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell pursed his lips and stared at his father. "I won't back out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'm going back now. You go back to the hospital and rest," Samir said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll stay here for a while and then go back," Lornell said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samir didn't say anything and left with his team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The communication between father and son was unsatisfactory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell watched as Harley was wheeled out of surgery, and then watched as the Hart family followed their daughter all the way back to the ICU ward. They anxiously peered through the glass wall at Harley lying inside. Suddenly, Lornell felt a strange emotion welling up in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A bit...envious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I envy Harley for being loved by her parents in such a way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No wonder when the two of them were trapped together in the rubble of the explosion, she firmly believed that her mom and dad would come to rescue her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because... it seems to be true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he, along with his parents, only cares about whether the Quentin family has an heir or not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell glanced at Harley in the ICU room again. Since her father said she would wake up within 24 hours, she must be able to wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He and this little guy will probably meet frequently in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I wonder what expression the little one will have when he finds out about his engagement with her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wait a minute, little one, do you understand what a betrothal is? Lornell suddenly thought of this question and after a moment, he said to his subordinate next to him, "Let's go back to the hospital, I want to sleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, young master!" The subordinate responded and pushed the wheelchair towards the elevator.</p></div>
