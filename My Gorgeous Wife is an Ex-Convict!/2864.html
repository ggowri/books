        <h1>Chapter 2862</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Videos...' Valda Theller froze slightly before understanding what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yeah, many people were filming with their phones. Of course, there would be people who uploaded the videos they recorded to the internet. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While laughing at herself, Valda Theller looked at Raymond Bowman. "Mr. Bowman, I think we're not even friends, so I have nothing to do with you. This is my home, and you're not welcome here. Please get out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman said, "Valda, I'm just worried about you! I know I've made a lot of mistakes. I just want you to be okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to protect her and make things right! However, he realized in the end that she would not even let him make it up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need," Valda Theller said hoarsely. She looked exhausted. "Raymond Bowman, I'm exhausted today. I really don't want to deal with you anymore and only want some time alone. If you think you've wronged me, leave me alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman was about to say something but eventually smiled bitterly. "Alright, I got it. I'll leave. Have a good rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he turned and said to Camille Strickland, who was nearby, "Please take care of Valda."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to tell me that. Besides, Valda has a boyfriend now. Brian will take care of Valda, so you don't have to bother," Camille Strickland said that to trigger Raymond Bowman but failed to notice the pain in Valda Theller's eyes after hearing the name &lsquo;Brian&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman finally left. Camille Strickland said to her best friend, "Valda, why don't you call Brian and tell him about this? He can easily remove these videos from the internet and help you solve this problem."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller still stood blankly in the same place and did not move, let alone reach for her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Camille Strickland took her best friend's phone out of her bag and handed it to her best friend. "Hurry and contact Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Contact him... What should I say even if I do call him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Should I ask him why he turned away? Should I ask him if I don't matter to him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda!" Camille Strickland urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller tapped on the phone screen. However, instead of dialing Brian's phone number, Valda Theller opened a webpage and searched for the keywords &lsquo;Valda Theller, comic fiesta&rsquo;. Soon, she found the videos that had been uploaded online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She clicked on one of them, which showed what happened at today's comic fiesta&mdash;the show Wynne put on and the mess she was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, what are you doing here? Stop watching!" Camille Strickland's hand blocked her phone screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille, take your hand away. I want to take a good look," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland panicked as she looked at her best friend's quiet appearance. After some hesitation, she took her hand away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller instantly saw what was going on in the video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing watching the video patiently, she clicked on another related video. The angle of each video was different. They were taken from different angles by different people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller watched videos of the same event from different angles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland became increasingly panicked. "Valda, what's come over you? Say something!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille, do you really think Brian will help me if he knows about this? Will he protect me?" muttered Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, he's your boyfriend! He surely will!" Camille Strickland said matter-of-factly.</p></div>
