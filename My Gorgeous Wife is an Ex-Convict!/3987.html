        <h1>Chapter 3985</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should be relieved, shouldn't he? Whether it was someone trying to please him by forcing her to drink, making her miserable, or her father wanting to cut off her finger, she was the one suffering, so he should be happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he felt inexplicably annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even explain why he was annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he deliberately avoided seeing this woman, he was still affected by her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to be influenced by this woman anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick said to himself in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go after her again." Mick threw the dagger in his hand aside and said to his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason raised an eyebrow, "What, are you trying to protect her? Don't forget, she used you, deceived and betrayed you. Isn't she the one you hate the most? She got both things, I'm already being kind by only asking for one finger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's between her and me. Even if she has to pay the price for it, it should be my decision what kind of price she should pay!" After saying this, Mick directly took Nancy's hand and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason watched his son and Nancy leave, a faint smile appearing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His child...really takes after him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought this child lacked emotions, but once real emotions came, he would be more devoted than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, being devoted is not always a good thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he encounters someone who doesn't know how to cherish it, he will only end up hurting himself in the end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Nancy surprised him a bit. If Mick hadn't appeared just now, that knife would have really cut her little finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chairman." The secretary walked into Jason's office and said, "Do you want to follow the young master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need." Jason said calmly, "Also, you timed this matter well today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just following the chairman's orders." The secretary said respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young master's sudden appearance in the chairman's office was not accidental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She met the young master at a certain time according to the chairman's orders, and then casually informed him that the chairman was meeting Nancy in his office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for whether the young master would come or not, it was up to him to decide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Mick really loves this woman?" Jason suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This..." The secretary hesitated for a moment, "The young master still cares about Miss Fowler. When I mentioned Miss Fowler in your office, he immediately changed his expression and rushed over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like he really cares," Jason murmured, "but if this kid forgives this woman so easily, then he'll probably be eaten alive by her for the rest of his life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Mick pulled Nancy directly to the underground garage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two got into the car, and Mick drove away from Reed Group without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car was silent, with a suppressed atmosphere permeating it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy pursed her lips and couldn't help but ask, "Where are we going..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" He interrupted her directly, his expression like he was holding back something, already at the limit of his patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She anxiously bit her lip and didn't speak again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he angry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, he has the right to be angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was too presumptuous, thinking that by breaking a finger, she could really repay what she owed Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how to repay it, it should be up to Mick to decide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The decision is in his hands.</span></p></div>
