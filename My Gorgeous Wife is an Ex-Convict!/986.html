        <h1>Chapter 985</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After that, one of Jason&rsquo;s men started talking to the owner of the diner while another started driving out the customers, telling them all the food they had eaten today was free of charge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some were reluctant to leave, but after watching men in black suits walking in one by one, they left out of fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally, Brian and Grace saw Jason who was standing near the diner's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace looked a little surprised as if she did not expect Jason to be here, while Brian seemed to have expected him to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at Jason and said, "Want to join us for dinner? We just ordered, so they haven't served the food. If you want to join us, we probably need to add two more dishes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason pursed his thin lips and walked toward the small square table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace subconsciously pulled her hand away from Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, Brian let go as she had hoped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is the food ready yet?" Brian asked the owner of the diner who was still in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The owner finally came to himself and answered, "Ah. Yes... Yes!" With that, he hurriedly served the dishes Brian ordered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We'd like to order two more dishes," said Brian as he randomly ordered two dishes from the menu.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, sure!" the owner quickly replied before hurrying off to prepare the two dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian, Grace, and Jason were the only customers left in the diner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them were gathered around a small square table, and the atmosphere was strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace only felt that the air around her seemed tense, and the expression on Jason's face seemed ghastly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just when she thought Jason would reject Brian's offer, he opened his mouth and said, "Sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace was immediately stunned and stared at Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Is he really... going to have dinner with us?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the matter? You don't want to eat with me?" Jason raised his eyes and looked at Grace who was still in a daze. "Or do you think I'm disturbing you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace pursed her lips and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was afraid that her words might offend him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace simply picked up the chopsticks and started eating the food. Jason turned his head to look at Brian. "You don't give up easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I give up? Grace doesn't have a boyfriend, and I don't have a girlfriend. I don't think there's anything wrong with me loving her and pursuing her," Brian said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Stella? Haven't you been looking for her? Now that you&rsquo;ve found her, you're bored?" said Jason as he glanced out of the corner of his eye at Grace who was eating with her head hung low.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace continued to eat as if she had no interest in whatever they were talking about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian said frankly, "Before I found Stella, I thought I would fall in love with her if I found her. However, it was because I found her that I realized who I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason felt more stung by his assured tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if the man's connection with Grace was something he could never break.</p></div>
