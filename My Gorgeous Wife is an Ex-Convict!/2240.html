        <h1>Chapter 2238</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace handled the scene. Those who did not want to offend the Reed family naturally would not tell anyone about the fiasco, and there would not be any gossip news about it published online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had his driver send Kyla, Mrs. Corbyn, and Nelson back to the store while his car followed behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After watching Kyla, Mrs. Corbyn, and Nelson enter the store, his car was still parked not far from the store. He stared blankly at the lights inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always liked to look at the lights inside the store from this position. It made him feel close to Kyla. If he was lucky, he could see her taking out the trash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could no longer stay here. She would be scared if he got close, and he had promised her that he would stay away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was already lucky to see her and even get close to her tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door to the store suddenly opened and Nelson Corbyn ran out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn ran to the car and gently rapped on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was a little stunned. He opened the door and got down from the car. "What's wrong? Did something happen to your mother?" There was inconcealable anxiety in his voice, and he subconsciously wanted to run to the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, Mommy's fine," said Nelson Corbyn as he looked at his father sternly. "Thank you for protecting Mommy tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to protect his mother when Mr. Lambert showed up today, but his father reacted first and protected Mommy before he could make a move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the bad man talked badly about his mother, he suddenly realized that sometimes, fighting alone would not be enough to protect his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He still could not protect his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when his father said that his mother would be the only wife he ever had and that the bad man would pay for what he said, the bad man turned pale and fell to the ground in fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, he was suddenly grateful for the man he had hated so much but who was also his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hated his father for hurting his mother and not protecting her. It was clear that his mother needed protection more than anyone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His biggest motivation over the years was to get stronger so that he could protect his mother and grandmother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw his father protect his mother today, he found his father rather cool! It was as if his hatred for his father was quietly fading away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at his son and sighed quietly. "You don't need to thank me. It's only natural for me to protect your mommy. I owe your mommy so much, and I hate myself for not protecting your mommy sooner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had protected Kyla well, they would not have turned out like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss bent over and looked straight at his son's eyes that were similar to Kyla's. "Don't figure things out late like me. If you meet someone you like, protect them no matter what. Don't regret it afterward." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn listened on with a hazy notion. The only people he wanted to protect right now were his mother and grandmother.</p></div>
