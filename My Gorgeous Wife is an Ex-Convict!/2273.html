        <h1>Chapter 2271</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the police car arrived at the hospital, Martin Weiss was sent to the emergency room. Kyla was in better condition. The two wounds in her neck were not deep, and the baby she was carrying was not affected much. All she needed was to have her neck wounds tended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was being rescued in the emergency room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not long after, Grace and Lina rushed over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, are you okay? Is the baby alright?" Grace asked in panic as she ran into Kyla's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The baby and I are fine. I just suffered some minor injuries," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's great!" Grace and Lina breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Martin still in the emergency room? I... I want to wait outside," Kyla said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"With your condition, you deserve a good rest. You don't have to worry about Martin Weiss. Jason and Hadwin have gone over. If anything happens, they can deal with it," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip, still wanting to go and take a look at the situation. She would not be at ease if she did not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't we let Kyla go over? I'll ask the nurse to bring a wheelchair. Kyla can go there in the wheelchair so that she won&rsquo;t have to exert any effort,&rdquo; said Grace. Kyla probably would not rest well in the ward if they did not let her go over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could only nod at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After asking for a wheelchair, Grace wheeled Kyla over in the wheelchair while Lina followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three went to a room connected to Martin Weiss's surgery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the room's French window, one could see the surgery in progress. Several specialists were watching from the French window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were also digital screens in the room that gave a more visual view of the surgery's current progress and what the doctor was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason and Hadwin Stephenson were currently there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the digital screen. It was a close-up of Martin Weiss&rsquo;s wounds. She could see the doctor treating him, and it was a bloody scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she hastened to warn Kyla, "Kyla, stop looking. "</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, stop looking. It might cause discomfort instead," said Lina, also trying to block Kyla's view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, get out of the way. I... want to see," Kyla pushed her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Lina hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said again, "I should&rsquo;ve been the one to suffer these injuries, but he suffered them for me. I want to see and know what injuries he&rsquo;s suffering for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina fell silent at that. Moments later, she got out of the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she knew she would insist on watching too if Hadwin ever suffered such injuries for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bloody wounds on the screen instantly came into Kyla's view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked silently at the wounds. The wounds... would probably be branded in her mind for life. It would tell her what price he had paid to save her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She watched the doctor clean and stitch up the wounds...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His wounds were not only on his neck but also where he had hurt himself with the wooden stick. This included his hands, head, and other areas that were covered by his clothes.</p></div>
