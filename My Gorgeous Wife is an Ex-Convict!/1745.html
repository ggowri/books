        <h1>Chapter 1743</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace!" Jason shouted hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's eyes finally closed wearily, and intense fatigue swept her whole body. Even though she fainted, her hands still clung to Jason and did not let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed, you..." Terrence froze. "Are... Are you conscious now? Does your head... not hurt anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No." Jason held Grace and carefully pulled her hands that were holding him off. "I'm very conscious now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Joseph came forward and said, "Mr. Reed, although you're awake and your head no longer hurts, you'd better get sedated and have a good rest. Although your hypnosis failed, next time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I won&rsquo;t continue with the sessions." What Jason said surprised both Dr. Joseph and Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence said in confusion, "Young master Reed, what... What do you mean? Are you not going to get your memory back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes stared intently at the woman in his arms. "Yes, there's no need for that..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Because I already remember everything.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the memory was so painful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Two hours later, Secretary Wang, who was in prison, looked at the small note in his hand with a playful smile on his face. He muttered, "If you were still alive, would you want Young Master and Grace to be together or be forever separated, Old Master? It would be interesting if Young Master recovers his memory..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt as though she had entered a long and deep sleep. In her sleep, someone kept calling out her name. "Grace... Grace... Grace..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Jay calling her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Oh yes. Jay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How is Jay doing? Is he alright? He...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace suddenly opened her eyes and saw a bright yellow light. She heard that familiar voice. "Grace, you&rsquo;re finally awake!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, that familiar face entered her line of sight. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, this is..." Grace tried to sit up, but her bones seemed to hurt and she gasped in pain when she moved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said quickly, "Don't get up. Lie down. We're in the hospital. You&rsquo;re injured. You need to do some tests and rest for a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Injured?' Then, Grace recalled what had happened. "What about you? Are you okay? Does your head still hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It doesn't hurt anymore," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said with a shudder, "Jay, don't resort to such a method again to recover your memory. I was scared to death when I saw you like that. Do you know how scared I was that something would happen to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So you'd rather get yourself hurt?" said Jason as he took Grace's hands. Even though her hands had been applied with ointment, they were red and swollen, looking worse than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How are... my hands?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since you were unconscious, the doctors could only do a preliminary examination and take your X-ray. You didn't hurt the bones, but the nerves in your hands need further examination," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There's no need for further examination. It's only a minor injury," she said nonchalantly. She feared that further examination would lead to him knowing the truth about her hands and make him feel worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't ever do that again. Terrence said you were hugging me so hard that you spat out blood!" said Jason. Fortunately, the test results they got after she was admitted to the hospital were all fine. Otherwise, he would never forgive himself.</p></div>
