        <h1>Chapter 2929</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded her head heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled, a smile of relief. She was willing to forgive him, that was good... that was good...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But as she looked at his smile, her nose felt extremely sour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the hospital, the doctor examined Brian Hart and Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, the remaining drink in Camille Strickland's glass from the bar was brought in for analysis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, it was determined that Camille Strickland's drink contained sedatives, so she was just asleep for now and would naturally wake up when the drug wore off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her friend confirmed to be okay, Valda Theller finally felt a little relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Brian Hart, although the wound was not deep and did not affect any vital organs, he still needed 11 stitches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor administered local anesthesia on the spot in the emergency room and began stitching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, you should go outside first. It might get a little bloody later," Brian Hart said, afraid that she would feel uncomfortable seeing the scene later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Valda Theller shook her head. "I'll stay here. If it hurts later, you can hold my hand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was slightly stunned, his phoenix eyes fixed on her for a while before he slowly said, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So he held her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And she stood by his side, watching as the doctor cut open his clothes and saw the wound still bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor and nurse quickly disinfected his wound and administered anesthesia before stitching it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each stitch felt like it was telling her how reckless she had been. If it weren't for her impulsiveness, he wouldn't have been injured like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Clearly, this wound should have been on her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She watched stiffly, while he comforted her softly, "Don't be afraid, it doesn't really hurt, it just looks a little ugly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He, the injured one, was comforting her, the uninjured one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the doctor finished stitching his wound, she felt completely drained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, it's best to stay in the hospital for observation for a few days. If there is any inflammation, further treatment will be needed," the doctor said, handing over the hospitalization order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart lay on a mobile stretcher, pushed by a nurse to the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller followed along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the ward, Brian Hart lay down on the bed, while his subordinates stood in a row in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um, I'll stay overnight tonight," Valda Theller said proactively. "If you need anything, you can call me to help you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does that include helping me to the bathroom?" Brian Hart asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Valda Theller was stunned, then her face turned red in an instant. The bathroom issue... if she really had to help...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her embarrassed expression, he felt that she was so cute that if it weren't for the inappropriate timing and occasion, he would have wanted to hug her tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart's gaze turned to his row of subordinates. "Leave two people outside tonight, the others don't need to stay in the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," they replied, then filed out.</p></div>
