        <h1>Chapter 4190 He is a good person.</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was stunned. She had only blurted it out without thinking, but she never expected that the person who had saved her from the village was actually the father of her baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> For a moment, she just stared at him, unable to say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Finally, Kit couldn't help but ask, "What's wrong? Are you disappointed because I'm the father of the child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was afraid, afraid of seeing disappointment in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He had once seen disappointment in her eyes, and it had made him feel cold all over, as if a pain was spreading through his body. Even breathing became difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And he was so afraid of experiencing that feeling again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No!" Tina laughed, a sweet and content smile on her thin face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her smile almost mesmerized him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm happy, really happy that you're the father of our child. You're so much better than I imagined. You have no idea, I even thought maybe the father of the child was in prison or no longer in this world. That's why I ended up alone in the water and eventually ended up in the village," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was obvious that she had let out a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But Kit murmured, "But how do you know I'm a good person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You saved me, didn't you?" she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Does saving someone automatically make you a good person?" he countered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This question seemed to stump her, and Tina thought about it seriously before looking at Kit. "Then are you a bad person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was a straightforward question, just like her character.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even though she had lost her memory, she was still the same as before &ndash; direct and unassuming!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "...No," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But in a way, he was. Because just a moment ago, he had told her a huge lie, making her believe that he was the person she loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina breathed a sigh of relief. "That's good, then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Then she looked at him curiously. "So, who are you, and how did we meet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I... I used to be a singer. You were my fan," Kit murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "A singer?" Tina was surprised, not expecting Kit to have such a role. "Did I really like listening to your songs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, you really liked my songs. You bought many of my albums and noticed my efforts, the efforts that no one else had seen. You always encouraged me, supported me! And when I wanted to diversify my career, you even suggested that I try acting in period dramas," Kit explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As he talked about their past, a smile unconsciously appeared on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina listened attentively as Kit recounted their past experiences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Did you later film a period drama?" Tina asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, I did," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Can I see it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I finished filming, but it hasn't been released yet. Once it's aired, you can watch it," he explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Can you sing a song for me?" she suddenly wanted to hear him sing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Sure," Kit responded and started singing a cappella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The beautiful melody, accompanied by Kit's clear voice, captivated Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Is this Kit's singing voice? It sounds really good!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Indeed, his voice, just like he said earlier, could make her a fan!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So, was it because of the kind of feelings fans have for their idols that she gradually developed love for him? And even... had a child with him?!</p></div>
