        <h1>Chapter 2766</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said in advance, fearing he would pay the bill again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, whether it was their previous fake relationship or current real relationship, Brian took care of almost all of their expenses. She knew she could not afford some high-end places, but she also hoped to bear the costs for some of the more affordable ones. She did not want him to be the only one bearing the expenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was already grateful that he was willing to help her get the limited edition necklace for her friend's gift. She did not want him to pay for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter if I buy it for you. After all, I'm willing to pay for it," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But this gift is different. I still wish to buy a gift for Xinmina, and&hellip; uh&hellip; I can afford it. I can't afford the expensive stuff, but I can afford ordinary stuff. I've been saving up over the years from drawing comics," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not help wanting to laugh at her seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Other women wished to spend more of his money when they were dating him, but she was doing the opposite and wished to spend less of his money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boutique was on the fifth floor of the mall. On their way up to the fifth floor, Brian called his secretary and asked for a VIP account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The brand had given them ten accounts when they worked with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they came to the boutique, Brian showed the account, and Valda Theller asked about the limited edition necklace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, each VIP account can purchase one limited edition necklace," the sales assistant said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I want one. Can I have a look at it first?" Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, please wait a moment," the sales assistant said before turning around to the display case to get the necklace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller waited happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice rang out. "Valda Theller?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stiffened as she turned to look. Her face also turned slightly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was her classmate from university... Rhea Oliver. She was also one of the people who criticized her the most when she was attacked by the whole school because of Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver also had feelings for Raymond Bowman back then, so Rhea Oliver kept causing trouble for Valda Theller when Raymond Bowman pretended to show interest in Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Raymond Bowman later expressed in front of everyone that Valda Theller had pestered him, Rhea Oliver pretty much took the lead in attacking her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only would she criticize Valda Theller nastily, but she would also get other girls to beat her up together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was often covered with bruises back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The past was a nightmare for Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So it's really you," Rhea Oliver said with a sneer. Her eyes were full of contempt. "Aren't you an orphan? What are you doing here? Can you afford this brand's jewelry?"</p></div>
