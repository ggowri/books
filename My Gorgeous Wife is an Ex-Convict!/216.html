        <h1>Chapter 215</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she knew that Lina would not urge her to pay back the money, she owed Lina enough already and could not keep on accumulating her debt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over and over, Grace knelt, groveled, and got up... This repeated again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other extras became increasingly agitated as well as they knelt over and over again. Some people even shouted for more money and that they should not trouble people like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director saw the extras' mood getting worse and worse, so he sent the assistant director over to ask Evelyn for her opinion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Evelyn pretended to think before saying, &ldquo;How about this? I think she did a great job. She has a good posture, and her timing is right. Why don't she give a demonstration to the other extras so that the others can watch and learn? Once they&rsquo;ve observed how to do it correctly, they can practice again. It&rsquo;ll save us the effort.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Grace she was referring to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, I don't know whether this extra is willing to demonstrate for everyone. After all, she will be more tired than the others." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn looked like she had her best interest at heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not? There's no problem if we give her more money for it." The assistant director was overjoyed. After all, it was better to trouble one extra than the entire crew of extras.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If so many extras went on strike, not only would it be difficult to find so many replacements at once, but it was also easy to cause a stir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was much easier to get one person to kneel and grovel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the assistant director asked Grace to come forward and asked her to demonstrate for an extra 200 dollars. If she was unwilling to do it, she would be considered as breaching the contract. That would mean that she would have to leave with zero bucks. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Evelyn who was standing only a few steps away. She found the smile on Evelyn&rsquo;s face offensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that Evelyn was doing it on purpose. Whatever demonstration Evelyn requested for was just to embarrass Grace. However, 330 dollars a day was a lot for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, her knees had long been bent and she suffered plenty more humiliations in prison prior to this. To kneel and grovel was better than the torments she had suffered in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked past the assistant director to meet Evelyn's gaze. Then, she slowly smirked and affirmatively responded with four words, "All right, I&rsquo;ll kneel!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ran up to Evelyn with a calm look on her face. She was neither sad nor happy. She calmly asked Evelyn, "Shall I start the demonstration now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah... Yes!" Evelyn answered, stammering a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she react differently than she had expected? Grace should at least be mortified or unwilling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only in this way could she feel proud and show off in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, however, Grace's deadpan demonstration of kneeling and groveling in a perfectly standard pose left no room for error. This also left Evelyn entirely without any sense of triumph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This situation made it seem like Evelyn was the embarrassed one! &lsquo;Well, since Grace is going to be a robot, I'll let her kneel till kingdom come!&rsquo; Evelyn loathingly whispered in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sitting in the air-conditioned room, Lily listened as her assistant described the situation of the shooting. Her assistant even filmed Grace kneeling with her mobile phone and handed it to Lily to look at.</p></div>
