        <h1>Chapter 3849</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the morning, Mason came directly to the Barlow family's doorstep, looking as calm as ever, without the fierce appearance they had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? You both don't look too good," Mason spoke up. "Do you dislike my sudden visit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-no, Mason, we welcome you here. Besides, this is your second home!" Rosalind quickly spoke up. "I still remember how you used to live with the Barlow family. We've been family for so many years. You're just visiting your own home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind was trying hard to bring them closer with her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Archer also quickly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason casually pulled up a chair and sat down. "You and I are not family. For me, my family is only the Reed family, and Veronica."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you say that? Since you admit that Veronica is your family, then we are her parents, and naturally, we are your family too," Archer said somewhat displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you won't be her family anymore," Mason suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Archer and Rosalind didn't react for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, she will have nothing to do with you. Your life and death have nothing to do with her. So if you still plan to use her to satisfy your own greed, then you will bear the consequences," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does that mean? We are her parents. Is she planning to cut ties with us?" Archer shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, cut ties," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it! Our Veronica wouldn't do that," Archer yelled. For him, his eldest daughter was the bridge connecting him to the Reed family. How could he let her cut ties with them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Believe it or not, I came here today just to make things clear to you," Mason said calmly. "In a few days, the Reed family will hold a press conference, publicly announcing that you and Veronica have cut ties. They will also declare to everyone that you have no relationship with the Reed family. In the future, I'm sure no one will lend you money again. As for the money you owe now, if you sell the house you're living in, it should be enough to pay it off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible, and the law does not allow for cutting ties!" Archer exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems you also understand the law. Then why don't you understand that the law doesn't require a daughter to pay for her father's debts?," Mason said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer suddenly realized the true reason why the Reed family held a press conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cutting ties cannot be legally enforced, but it can be done for show. It can make everyone understand that Veronica and the Barlow family have no relationship anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since everyone understands, what does it matter if the legal ties are not cut?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any case, the Barlow family can no longer expect to benefit from their eldest daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Archer's face became extremely ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind tried to please, "Mason, we...didn't expect those thugs to really go to </span><span>Veronica for money. We just casually mentioned that Veronica had some relationship with the Reed family. Who knew it would turn out like this? We are Veronica's parents, we wouldn't harm her. Mason, if you want to be with Veronica again, she will have to cut ties with her family. If this matter is made public, Veronica will lose face, won't she?"</span></p></div>
