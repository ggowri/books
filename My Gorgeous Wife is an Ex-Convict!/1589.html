        <h1>Chapter 1587</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Speaking of which, when are you leaving? Didn't you say you&rsquo;ve taken on a new project?&rdquo; Patrick asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I won&rsquo;t be leaving for now," muttered Brian. Even after five years, Grace still had no feelings for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he could not bear to leave. He wanted to stay in Emerald City. It would be good even if he could only look at her from afar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick sighed. Needless to say, his best friend's decision to stay probably had something to do with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But if things go on like this, when will Brian truly get over Grace? If he can never get over her, won't...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick suddenly shuddered at the thought of this! He only hoped it would not happen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After having something to eat with Jason, Grace went to the patio to get some fresh air. She saw Hadwin Stephenson standing alone on the patio, gazing at the moon in the sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a full moon tonight, and it hung upside down in the sky like a disk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, as if aware that someone else was here, Hadwin Stephenson turned his head to look in Grace's direction. She was slightly startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why are you alone?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I came to get some air after having something to eat. Jay and the others have some things to talk about," said Grace. After all, such banquets were where businessmen talked business and socialized. "What about you? Why aren't you with Katherine Jackson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"She went home first because she has something to do," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace took a few steps forward and walked up to Hadwin Stephenson. "Lina loved you. Even though you've split up, she keeps saying both of you don&rsquo;t share the same ideas, not that you don't love each other. It's just that between love and career, you chose the latter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face turned grim when he heard that. He could not help but clench the hands hanging by his sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, Lina remained on friendly terms even after breaking up with you. She never hated you or complained about you. Since you&rsquo;ve made your choice and are going to marry Katherine Jackson, why did you appear in her life again and mess it up?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew how hard it was for Lina to get over the man in front of her. She was scared that Hadwin Stephenson would set off waves in Lina&rsquo;s heart but could not give her anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Would this not hurt Lina a second time? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"She... told you about me?" Hadwin Stephenson's voice trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "She only told me that you appeared in front of her. Lina wants to start a new life. She doesn't want to be stuck in the past. If you ever loved Lina, don't disturb her peace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was silent as he clenched the hands by his sides. His nails sank deep into his palms, but he did not seem to feel any pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The worst pain to him was probably the pain of not being able to be with Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Jason walked over and saw what was going on. He said to Grace, "Are you done talking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, I&rsquo;m done. Let's go. I want to go home. The children should be asleep by now," said Grace.</p></div>
