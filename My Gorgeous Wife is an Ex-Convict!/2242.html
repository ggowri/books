        <h1>Chapter 2240</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was pretty much an invitation to leave. Kyla's attitude toward Jacqueline Bowman at this moment was indifferent and distant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It upset Jacqueline Bowman. However, with her purpose in mind, she endured it and said, "Kyla, I helped you out a lot back in prison. You can't forget me now that you're married to Martin Weiss and are close to the Reed family! You know how I'm doing. Why don't you put in a good word with Martin Weiss for my man? Doesn&rsquo;t the Weiss family have a real estate development project in Emerald City recently? Neal happens to have connections. Why don't you ask Martin Weiss to give him the project?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They could gain a lot of profit if they could get the project.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla only replied coldly, "I&rsquo;ve never gotten involved in his business. If Neal Reid wants this project, just have him bid for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman said, "I just think it's easier to get the project through you. If Neal Reid can get it, he&rsquo;ll be willing to marry me. Kyla, you can't ignore my happiness just because you have a good life now! Just consider it as repaying me for helping you out in prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A good life.' Kyla smiled bitterly. Her life now was indeed so much better than when she had just gotten out of prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want me to repay you, I can do that in other ways. But there's nothing I can do about your request." Kyla looked at Jacqueline Bowman as she rejected her. "Besides, if a man is only willing to marry you because of a mere business deal, just how much do you think he loves you? Also, doesn't he have to divorce his wife if he marries you? I recall him saying he&rsquo;s married."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's expression changed. "I just want you to put in a good word for me. Won't you even do me such a small favor? How much he loves me and whether he's getting a divorce are between him and me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I can't help you with this." Kylarejected her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Jacqueline Bowman clenched her teeth in hatred. "I didn't expect you to be so heartless. Now that you&rsquo;ve married Martin Weiss and become the wife of a rich man, you don&rsquo;t want others to be happy too? Kyla, so what if you're Mrs. Weiss? Aren't you cooped up in this store anyway? If Martin Weiss cared about you, he would&rsquo;ve taken you to Weiss Residence. Why would he still let you sell all this crap here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only looked at Jacqueline Bowman quietly as if whatever she said right now did not bother her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the calmer she was, the stronger Jacqueline Bowman&rsquo;s resentment grew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss will abandon you someday! How long can you be Mrs. Weiss?" Jacqueline Bowman left the store after saying that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled faintly and looked down at her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would only be Mrs. Weiss until the baby was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the time came, she would divorce Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, their marriage was only to fend off rumors and give their children a legal identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, for some reason, she was faintly upset at the thought that she would divorce Martin Weiss someday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I upset about?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled bitterly. 'Martin Weiss and I have never been suitable for each other! It was that way then, and it&rsquo;s still the same now, isn't it?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The day of her pregnancy check-up soon arrived. Kyla took a taxi to the hospital alone. She arrived and had her routine check-up. Then, she went to the washroom while waiting for the report. </p></div>
