        <h1>Chapter 807</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three days later, Grace received a call from the law firm telling her she had passed the interview and that Lawyer Carter chose her to fill in the paralegal position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it was just a paralegal job, it meant that she was back in the legal world!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace called Lina to tell her the good news, Lina was sincerely happy for her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great! Work hard! I'm expecting you to treat me to dinner when you become a barrister!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help laughing. "I don't have to be a barrister to treat you. I'll treat you to a feast when I get my first paycheck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's a deal! I'll be waiting for your feast," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Grace. It was as if her depression for several days had lifted now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Life goes on,' she thought, and she could get over it little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll let go of all my feelings for Jason and think of it as an absurd dream!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she finished the call, Grace looked at her phone and opened her contacts list, which contained two phone numbers labeled &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One was the phone she had bought him which he got a calling card for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other one was his usual phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath, tapped the screen, and erased the two phone numbers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like cutting off the last connection between him and her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I'll get over you." Her voice drifted away softly into the air...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After work, Hadwin came to pick up Lina. Many people in the design firm knew that Lina had a stroke of luck to be able to date the chairman of Stephenson Group. Therefore, every time Hadwin came to pick her up, he became a unique sight in the design firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were even a lot of women with ulterior motives who would deliberately dress up and find the opportunity to appear in front of Hadwin, fantasizing that he would take a fancy to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Lina was not a beauty. She was just comely at best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In many people's opinion, Hadwin only made Lina his girlfriend because he wanted to experience something new. He would dump Lina before long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina met her colleagues and saw the mixture of ridicule as well as sympathy in their eyes, she really wanted to say that her relationship with Hadwin was not what they thought at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she did not need to explain herself to these irrelevant people. She could just get a new job in another company when she broke up with Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting into Hadwin's car, Lina said, "There are five today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" For a moment, he did not understand what she meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you notice that five female colleagues from our firm appeared within 50 meters of you?" she asked, and these five female colleagues had even deliberately dressed up. There was even a female colleague who had changed into new clothes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin rolled his eyes at Lina. "Why should I notice?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're interested in you," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his thin lips, staring at her with a half-smile. "Do I have to notice people who are interested in me? Or do you want your boyfriend to court other women?"</p></div>
