        <h1>Chapter 842</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks, it's just a minor pain. I don't need to go to the hospital for it," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Start the car," Jason said coldly to the driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver started the car and drove toward the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that once Jason decided to do something, he would see it to the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she kept quiet. Since there was no way for her to escape, she could only roll with the punches and accept whatever came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, over the years, what she had learned most was patience and acceptance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was slightly surprised by her sudden quietness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just sat quietly in the car with her slightly pale face and furrowed eyebrows. Her bright almond-shaped eyes were half-closed while her hands covered her knees. The blue veins on the back of her hand were popping out faintly as if she was suppressing the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt?" He could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. It's not that painful," she said lightly. After all, compared to the pain she felt from standing too long a few days ago, today's pain was nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his thin lips. "You haven't been to Mingde for your check-ups?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That hospital isn&rsquo;t for me," she said. Private hospitals like that were usually only affordable for the rich people in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she was a mere paralegal with a salary of only 7,000 dollars a month. How could she afford to go to a hospital like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the problem in her joints was not something that could be cured overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's nonsense. I'll have someone arrange a weekly appointment for you to see the doctor," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was in a trance for a while. His words made her feel as if they had not broken up and he still cared about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, we&rsquo;re already broken up, so you don't need to arrange for me to see a doctor," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her, his thin lips opening slowly. "So what? I may have broken up with you, but that doesn't mean I can't arrange for you to see a doctor. Even if we&rsquo;re broken up, I can still get you anything you want or need. Even if you want a law firm, I'll get you one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a wry smile. 'What's this? A parting gift?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her almond-shaped eyes and looked at those beautiful peach blossom eyes. "I don't need these things." If she really accepted his offers, she would feel as if she was willing to become his game object for money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice continued, "We broke up, so we have nothing to do with each other anymore. There&rsquo;s no reason for me to accept any gifts from you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you being my &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; again? Didn't you want to be my &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;?" he asked suddenly. Her words earlier, &lsquo;nothing to do with each other&rsquo;, were like an invisible needle that made him feel nothing but a pang in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sis?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was immediately stunned. How long had it been since she had heard him call her by that name?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... not your 'Sis'," she croaked out in a hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smirked a little, and his large hand rested on the back of her hand which was on her knees. "If I say you are, you are."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a split second, she felt as if her heart was hit by something. &lsquo;It hurts!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
