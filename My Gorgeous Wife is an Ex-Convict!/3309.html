        <h1>Chapter 3307</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After completing their prenatal check-up at the hospital, Valda and Brian went to a nearby restaurant to have breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, Valda is the main one eating at the moment, while Brian is sitting beside her, occasionally using a tissue to wipe the corners of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing breakfast, Valda turned to Brian and said, "I want to go for a walk to the nearby mall and buy some baby items."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hasn't everything been prepared already?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Those were bought by my parents and godmother, I want to pick something myself," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially her in-laws, even though the child hasn't been born yet, they have already bought a lot of baby supplies and toys and placed them in the nursery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, she thought the nursery was too big, but now that all those things are stuffed in, she doesn't think it's big anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even suspected that after the child was born, her father-in-law and mother-in-law would directly move the mother and baby store into their villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them left the restaurant and went directly to the nearby shopping mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's already past 10 o'clock now, but since it's not a day off, there aren't many people in the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda arrived at the floor for the mother and baby section and began to look around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Children's things are always especially cute, and when faced with a pile of adorable items, they often want everything and start thinking about buying them all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Valda can understand why her in-laws bought so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda picked out some baby clothes and shoes. Of course, since she didn't know whether the baby was a boy or a girl, she tried to choose neutral colors like yellow that could work for either gender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she passed by a counter, her eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a counter selling some mother and baby items, and there was a booklet displayed in the window. It was a baby journal that could record the baby's first year of life, from birth to one year old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each page of the booklet had cute designs and came with some stickers that could be used for DIY customization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you like this booklet?" Brian asked beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, it's quite interesting. It can record the baby's milestones and you can also stick photos and customize it yourself. I feel like it will be very meaningful once it's completed," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally, Brian bought the journal for his beloved wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back at the villa, Valda began to carefully flip through the journal, studying the stickers and searching online for similar journals. She looked completely engrossed in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Brian saw Valda starting to write something in the journal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't this supposed to be recorded after the baby is born?" Brian asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"These are some initial thoughts and wishes for the baby. I can write down my expectations for the baby. After I finish, you can also write something for the baby," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian smiled slightly and asked, "Are these words for the baby? If their children grow up in the future and see these words written for their unborn child, what will they think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that unconsciously, he has become more and more excited about the birth of this child.</p></div>
