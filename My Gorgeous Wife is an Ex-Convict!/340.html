        <h1>Chapter 339</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she not study law in the hope that justice would be served? However, now she could not even serve her own justice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're clever," the man snorted before saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's hands were tightly clenched into fists. Being trampled on was just that easy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She trembled more and more as the dagger came closer to her face. Suddenly, she lowered herself and rushed toward the door of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she opened the door, she was suddenly held down by the two bodyguards who were guarding the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man went up to Grace and sneered. "I thought you were brave, but it turns out you were just finding the opportunity to run away. However, just like you said, there's no escape."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, there was no escape, but at least she wanted to give herself the option of resisting even if she was a prey that was at the mercy of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was once again brought into the room. Just as she saw that the dagger was about to cut her face this time, the door of the room was suddenly kicked open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A figure came in and went straight over to Grace. In a fraction of a second, someone else took the dagger. The secretary was kicked out of the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you a little too impatient, Grandpa?" Jason played with the dagger as he looked at Old Master Reed who was still half-lying in bed. "Didn't I tell you? Don't touch her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed's face was unmoved as if the incident was no surprise to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's not for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's up to me to decide whether she's for me, not you," Jason said and turned to glance at Grace. "Are you hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. He came just in time, so she was not hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary who had just wanted to hurt Grace was getting up awkwardly. Jason walked right up to him. "You should be glad you didn't hurt her today, or I promise you'll end up regretting it for the rest of your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he finished, he kicked him in the chest and trampled over him. "However, you must learn your lesson," he said and tossed the dagger. Then, he raised his fist and punched the man in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was a tough guy, he was now about to be beaten to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wouldn't just be punching you if it wasn&rsquo;t because she'll be uncomfortable with all the blood," said Jason while he took Grace by the hand and headed for the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Cough..." Old Master Reed coughed. "Are you going to follow in your father's footsteps?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason paused before striding off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Cough, cough, cough..." Old Master Reed coughed repeatedly. Today was just a test. A test to see how big of a place this woman held in his grandson's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the woman was not important enough, then it did not matter whether her face was ruined. If his grandson came, it meant that the woman... was extremely important in Jason's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, tonight was the birthday of the woman who gave birth to Jason.</p></div>
