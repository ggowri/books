        <h1>Chapter 1181</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded while Hadwin Stephenson looked at the slightly pale Grace with a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, Hadwin Stephenson said to Lina, "Tell me, is there any possibility that Grace is pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina almost spat out her drink when she heard this. "No way!" she replied without hesitating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her affirmation made Hadwin Stephenson a little confused. "Why are you so sure? It hasn't even been three months since Grace broke up with Jason. You won't be able to tell even if she is pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina bit her lip. How could she put it? After all, it was Grace's privacy. The possibility of Grace getting pregnant was too low. She had gotten injured so badly in prison, and though she had undergone treatment after getting together with Jason, they broke up shortly after that. Grace did not want to go through that kind of treatment anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Facing Hadwin Stephenson's gaze, Lina said, "In short, there's no way Grace can be pregnant now, and Hadwin... I promised Grace that my child will be her child, and she'll be the mother of our child too. You won't blame me for making this decision on my own, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at the person in front of him and smiled gently. "I won't." It was because he knew what kind of friend Grace was to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was probably the kind of friend she could give her life to!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a blessing to have found such a friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hugged Hadwin Stephenson's waist. "Hadwin, it's great to have you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gently caressed her hair. "I'm going back to the Stephenson family&rsquo;s house to deal with those matters in two days. Wait for me in Emerald City. This time, I'll have bodyguards protect you in the dark. I won't let you encounter that kind of danger again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are we... going to be separated again for a short time? But I don't want to part with him.' "Why don't... I take a few days off and go with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't be childish. I can't solve them in a few days. Even if I'm fast, it'll take two months!" Only in two months could he close the net and make sure everything was surefire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh," she replied dully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait for me. I'll marry you once I get back," Hadwin Stephenson said and gently kissed Lina on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the person he loved the most, and he wanted to give her a bright future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went to the hospital the next day, she met Chase Harper again in front of the inpatient department of the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper said, "What a coincidence. Are you here to visit your friend who's hospitalized?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yes, I'm going to visit Nelson in pediatrics after visiting my friend. How about you? Are you here to see Nelson today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper nodded. "I told him about Transformers yesterday. I have a few Transformer toys from when I was little but had never thrown them away, so I wanted to bring them to Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes lit up. 'Transformers?' She remembered she had been interested in Transformers for a while when she was a child. However, such toys were a little too expensive back then. When her grandmother finally bought one for her, she ended up breaking it. Since then, she had never bought another Transformers toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I've played with a Transformers toy before, but it broke afterward."</p></div>
