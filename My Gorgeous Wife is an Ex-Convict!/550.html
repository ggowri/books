        <h1>Chapter 549</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace left, Kyla looked down at her son who was still sound asleep and raised her hand to touch his young face with a bitter expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought of when the child asked where his father was in sign language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only tell the worst lie&mdash;in heaven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know how long she could keep the lie. However, she could not tell Nelson the truth about where his real father was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was she to say? Tell him that his father had purposely approached her with malice from the beginning? Tell him that she shouted at him, "What if I have your baby?" However, the man just coldly said, "Get an abortion. Who are you to bear my child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did Nelson know that from the beginning, his father did not expect to have such a small being as Nelson?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That man had never loved her. It was just her wishful thinking from the start. She was foolish. She was stupid. After understanding his true intentions of approaching her, she just ended up with a more tragic ending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She might not have survived her time in prison without this little being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson had finally met his father today. She had been trying to prevent the father and son from meeting and even moved away from the city they originally lived in. She did not expect them to meet in such a situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Martin Weiss did not recognize Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson rolled over in his sleep and smacked his lips. He must be having sweet dreams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla lovingly helped her son to pull the quilt over his body and took out her phone to search for keywords regarding Martin Weiss on the internet. Soon, the pages were full of news about Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart sank. Sure enough, Martin Weiss had come to Emerald City. According to the news, Martin Weiss was in Emerald City for investment projects, so he would probably be here for some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This could be long or short, maybe a week or two. If longer, maybe a few months. If he had a major project in Emerald City, Martin Weiss might come back and forth frequently in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The probability of bumping into each other in the same city was always higher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps in the future, she had to avoid the possibility of running into Martin Weiss. She could only feel at ease when Martin Weiss left Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes fell on a photo below the news. In the photo, Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels were standing together with Dane affectionately holding Martin Weiss's arm. She looked like a blissful woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them did look good together. They were as beautiful as a golden couple in the eyes of others. No one would care that underneath all that beauty, there was a woman in despair who had even thought of suicide countless times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For three years, she had deliberately avoided all news about Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels, thinking that the sight of their intimacy would bring resentment and hatred in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now that she saw such a photo, she found that all she was feeling was a sense of peace.</p></div>
