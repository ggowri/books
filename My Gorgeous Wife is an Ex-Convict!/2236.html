        <h1>Chapter 2234</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Tina Stephenson, who was still asleep in her cradle, Chandler Hunter's little face beamed with satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The triplets and Nelson were meeting Chandler Hunter for the first time. Jasper asked Chandler Hunter curiously, "What's a betrothal?" After all, the word &lsquo;betrothal&rsquo; was a word she had never heard before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chandler Hunter pressed his lips together and ignored them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn answered Jasper Reed, "It's a tradition where a man brings gifts to the bride's house and expresses his will to marry her. If the bride's family accepts the gifts, it means they&rsquo;re willing to let him marry their daughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn was only in the third grade, but he knew many things because he enjoyed reading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper listened with a hazy notion. She understood the idea of marriage. It meant two people getting married&mdash;just like her daddy and mommy. Then, they could have babies and be with each other forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Tina Stephenson woke up and started wailing. She was obviously signaling that it was time to feed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chandler Hunter reached out and carried Tina Stephenson out of the cradle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strangely enough, the baby, who was wailing, stopped and stared at Chandler Hunter with her dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chandler Hunter held the baby skillfully. He was clearly no stranger. Later, he took the milk from the nanny and fed the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a somewhat rare sight to see a seven to eight-year-old child feed a one-month-old baby, especially when the child looked familiar with what he was doing. It was as if he had fed her that way many times, and he fed her... so frankly and matter-of-factly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chandler Hunter did not care about the eyes on him. All his attention was on Tina Stephenson. After Tina Stephenson finished drinking, he began to burp her, which surprised the guests again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the guests now understood that the child from the Hunter family was probably going to the Stephenson family's future son-in-law. After all, the Stephenson family trusted him enough to let him carry their baby for such a long time. They even seemed unfazed by it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was obvious that the little boy from the Hunter family had carried the baby many times before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once the party was over, Kyla bade goodbye to Lina. Grace was just about to say that she would arrange a driver to send them home but Martin Weiss spoke first, "I'll have my driver send them home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw that Kyla had no intention of rejecting, so she said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss walked out of the hotel with Kyla, Mrs. Corbyn, and Nelson, a figure suddenly rushed out from the side. They apologized repeatedly when they saw Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, I didn't know what was good for me that day and got carried away. Please spare the Lambert family, Mr. Weiss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked over. It was Mr. Lambert who was in the private room that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Mr. Lambert looked different from the glamorous man that day. He looked like someone else entirely. His chin was full of stubble, his hair was a little messy, and he looked unkempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only pushed Mr. Lambert away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Weiss family doesn't have any business dealings with the Yu family. Why did you come looking for me?&rdquo;</p></div>
