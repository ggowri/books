        <h1>Chapter 3698</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why bother picking up the clothes?" he asked again. "If they're dirty, just throw them away. Why bother washing them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The clothes are just dirty. They can be washed clean," she said. "It would be a shame to just throw them away like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A shame?" He sneered. "It's just a piece of clothing. What's there to be ashamed of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused. Yes, how could she forget that he was Mason from the Reed family? Even if this piece of clothing was expensive, it was just an ordinary piece of clothing to him. He could easily have as many new ones as he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still picked up the clothes and even squeezed out several hundred dollars from her meager living expenses to dry clean it, just because... it was his clothes, and he had protected her while wearing it, so it got dirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he know how he looked when he shielded her from the pasta that was thrown at her? It made her feel like she was back in the past, when they were still together and he always protected her like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So... this piece of clothing..." she asked hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just throw it away, but it's not just garbage," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that the clothes in her hand became particularly heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garbage... was it just garbage to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after receiving this piece of clothing, she gently stroked it over and over again, as if she was reminiscing about the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry," she said, putting the clothes back in her bag and turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not throw it away?" His voice suddenly sounded in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip. How could she bear to throw away his clothes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But facing him, she couldn't say those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head, unconsciously gripping the handle of her bag tightly, standing there silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her, and suddenly a wordless anger filled his chest. He thought of the day he saw her backstage, standing silently as another woman scolded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few years, it seemed to have worn away all the edges and corners on her, making her so quiet and silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, are you only capable of silence? Veronica, when did you become like this?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed even more at a loss... Yes, when did she become increasingly quiet and </span><span>reserved?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if since he left her and she moved out of the Barlow family, living alone in the house her biological mother left her, she had fewer and fewer words to say to the empty house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because words are meant for communication with others, but in that empty house, she didn't even have anyone to talk to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Veronica looked up at Mason and said, "I'm sorry for appearing in front of you again. Originally, I was going to give this dress to the servants in the mansion to pass on to you. Since you think it can be thrown away, then I will throw it away later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pausing for a moment, she continued, "If my presence makes you unhappy, then I'm sorry. I will try my best to avoid appearing in front of you in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, she turned around and planned to leave again.</span></p></div>
