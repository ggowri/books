        <h1>Chapter 4228 Getting to Know Him Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I never regain my memory, if I can't remember anything about Chandler and me?" Tina whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she spoke those words, an indescribable sadness welled up inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then fall in love with Chandler again," Eugenia suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback, "Fall in love again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!" Eugenia shrugged, "A man like Chandler, it shouldn't be difficult to fall in love with him. You have no idea how many girls at our school have a crush on him. If it weren't for Chandler being devoted to you, everyone knows they wouldn't stand a chance. He would have been surrounded by a bunch of women!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't help but fall into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after Eugenia left, she couldn't stop thinking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Eugenia talk about Chandler like that, made her truly believe that Chandler is a good man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had some resistance towards Chandler while at the hospital, not wanting to accept that he was the man she once loved and the father of her child, that resistance seemed to fade away unconsciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During dinner, Tina suddenly said, "Do we have any old photos or videos of me and Chandler at home? I want to take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadwin and Lina were very surprised. After realizing this, Lina quickly said, "Yes, after we finish dinner, I'll get them for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Lina indeed brought several photo albums and a memory card to Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are just some of the photos of you and Chandler from childhood to now. If you finish looking at them and want to see more, I'll give you the others," Lina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked somewhat dazed at the pile of photo albums in front of her. When she inserted the memory card into the computer, she saw that it had a capacity of 1000G.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memories she had with Chandler, were they really so many...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina opened the album and began to look through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first ones she flipped to were from when she was just born. At that time, Chandler was already a 7-year-old boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler held her as a baby, his face expressionless. Looking into his eyes, it seemed to carry a sense of curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in the following photos, she grew day by day, and Chandler's expression seemed to gradually become more varied, his gaze towards her becoming increasingly gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would feed her with a bottle, hold her hand, and occasionally pick her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though carrying her was a bit of a burden for him at that age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at these photos, Tina's lips unconsciously curved into a smile, but her eyes began to well up with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the tears began to fall that she suddenly realized she was crying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she was deeply missing those moments captured in the photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next few days, Tina continued to look at those photos, as well as the old family videos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the third day, Tina called Chandler, "I want to meet you in person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." The voice on the other end of the phone seemed to carry a slight tremor but quickly responded with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the afternoon, at the agreed time, Tina met Chandler at the Stephenson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at Chandler standing in front of her. He appeared much thinner than she remembered from the photos before her disappearance. His tall figure was wrapped in a suit, giving off a somewhat empty feeling.</span></p></div>
