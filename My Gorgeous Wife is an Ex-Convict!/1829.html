        <h1>Chapter 1827</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yulai, why don't you go outside first? There's something I want to make clear to him too," Lina said as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman then started to walk toward the door. However, before leaving, he could not help but say to Hadwin Stephenson, "Mr. Stephenson, Lina is suffering from injuries. Please talk to her nicely. Don't start a fight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson ignored Anthony Sherman. He just stared at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman sighed and left the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina and Hadwin Stephenson were the only ones left in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you so desperate to cut ties with me that you won't even keep the baby?" His cold voice suddenly rang in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," she said after taking a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is it because of what happened back then? Is it because I broke up with you when you were seriously injured, so you won't give me a chance now?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Since we&rsquo;ve broken up, there's no need for us to get back together. The baby will only be a burden," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Pain flickered in his eyes. What about all his hopes and expectations&hellip;? Did she know how ecstatic he was after learning about her pregnancy? He thought it was a gift from God. God did not shatter his hopes and made them entangled with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she now said that what he considered to be a blessing was a burden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How pathetic and ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But you have feelings for me. You still love me. Why won't you be with me? I swear I'll spend the rest of my life protecting you and loving you. I&rsquo;ll never abandon you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Protect me? Love me? Never abandon me?" Lina suddenly laughed out loud. Every time she laughed, the bruises on her body from the car accident this morning seemed to hurt again. She recalled how Katherine Jackson had come out of the mansion this morning. That moment when Katherine Jackson made eye contact with her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps she would never forget how she had waited outside the mansion the entire night!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, what you said is simply the funniest joke I've ever heard. How dare you say that? You were the one who hurt me the most. If this is your love for me, then I would rather that you had never loved me. I will never have the slightest affection for you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her words seemed to trigger him. He suddenly bent over and unexpectedly kissed her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if to prove that she loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His kiss was hot and eager. It was so intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When his warm lips touched hers, she instantly fell into a trance. It was as if she had gone back to the past. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They had been so in love. She always loved it when he kissed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His kisses were always gentle and lingering but with a hint of longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He made her feel like she was important to him every time he kissed her.</p></div>
