        <h1>Chapter 2060</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, to her disappointment, Martin Weiss did not feel angry after hearing what she said. The only thing that changed was that the disgust in his eyes had become more obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Since you want to serve people, I'll arrange for you to serve people," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Paisley Daniels's expression changed, and she had a bad feeling. "Martin Weiss, what do you mean by that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It means... Paisley Daniels, do you think that just because you were in prison for five years, you can wipe the slate clean?" Martin Weiss walked forward, raised his hand, and slapped Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was instantly knocked to one side. Blood spilled out of her mouth, while her cheek was red and swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Paisley Daniels, the rest of your life will only be worse than your imprisonment," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Paisley Daniels angrily wanted to rush forward but was stopped by Martin Weiss's men. She was forced to kneel on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Also, I warn you not to give Kyla trouble. If you dare harm her again, you and even your parents will lead miserable lives. You&rsquo;ll surely live in hell for the rest of your life!" the cold voice warned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why... do you think I would give her trouble?" Paisley Daniels asked stubbornly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you don't want to give her trouble, what are you doing in Emerald City? Also, do you think I don't know you're stalking her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Martin Weiss turned around and said to his men, "Whatever she did to Kyla previously, let her suffer twice as much. I want her to pay for what she has done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, Mr. Weiss, we understand," his men answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she saw that Martin Weiss was about to leave, Paisley Daniels suddenly shouted, "Martin Weiss, you want me to pay for what I've done to Kyla. What about yourself? Shouldn't you pay too? I wasn't the one who treated Kyla the worst. It was you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stopped in his tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Paisley Daniels's words were like a merciless thorn, stabbing Martin Weiss's deepest fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Yes, he did not know that he treated Kyla the worst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was even scared to ask Kyla whether she hated him or Paisley Daniels more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though Kyla said she had forgiven him, he knew it was only because... he donated her his liver. He used a part of his body to atone for his sins. It was also his identity as Nelson's father that made her forgive him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... had she really forgiven him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe she just wanted to get over him, so she chose to forgive him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she had not forgiven him and still hated him, he would always have a place in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now, he did not even have that place anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After kindergarten ended, Grace brought Mick Reed, Jasper Reed, and William to Kyla's store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After hearing that Nelson was injured, Jasper insisted on coming to see Brother Nelson. Mick Reed had no comment. All he cared about were his parents and two other siblings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William came here because Jasper wanted to come.</p></div>
