        <h1>Chapter 2199</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers looked at her son mockingly and said, "If I go to prison, I won't be the only one humiliated but the Stephenson family and Stephenson Group will be too. Stephenson Group's stocks will plummet, and the shareholders will suffer heavy losses. Do you think you can stay as president?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers had thought of a way out for herself in such a short period of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can only let this go. From now on, I&rsquo;ll live my days here, while you can live yours back in Stephenson Residence!" said Emily Flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson smiled faintly. "Yes, you'll live your life here, but you can never leave this place!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers froze. "What do you mean? Are you going to lock me up in here? Are you going to lock up your own mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can call it 'locking up'. You&rsquo;ll spend the rest of your life in this old castle. Someone will take care of you, but you can forget about the life of luxury you want," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers immediately said furiously, "What right do you have to lock me up? I can leave whenever I want, and I'm not letting you lock me up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then details of the crime you committed will be sent to the police as soon as you set foot outside this old castle. Even though you're in a foreign country, we can resort to extradition. In that case, you'll have to spend the rest of your life in prison. You can choose between these two options," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers's face was full of disbelief. "No... No, you won't do that. It&rsquo;ll do you and the company no good. It&rsquo;ll even make the company suffer huge losses. You and the Stephenson family will be humiliated!&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said firmly, "I will do so! I'm not only the patriarch of the Stephenson family but also Lina's husband and the father of my daughter. I should get justice for them! If you don't believe me, you can try stepping out of the old castle and see whether I keep my word!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was no hesitation in his cold voice, and there was no emotion in his eyes as he looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if his affection for her had been exhausted after the many incidents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers felt a chill rising on her back. It was fear. She was afraid of her own son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was giving her the impression that he would... keep his word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No... You won&rsquo;t..." she muttered, not knowing whom she was trying to persuade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson just stared at Emily Flowers coldly. "You're staying here for the rest of your life. I'll come and collect your dead body in the future, but if you ever step out of her, I&rsquo;ll have to collect your corpse from prison.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Hadwin Stephenson left without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers shouted, "I'm your mother! I'm your mother! Are you going to do this to your mother... How could you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson did not stop no matter how she shouted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In his opinion, his mother had died long ago when she would rather destroy his happiness for money and power. She was dead to him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For some reason, Lina's heart beat violently all of a sudden. She had a nagging feeling in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After thinking about it, she texted Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina: [How are things over there? When are you coming home?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her phone soon rang. It was a call from Hadwin Stephenson.</p></div>
