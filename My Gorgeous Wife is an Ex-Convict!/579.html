        <h1>Chapter 578</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those penalties were no small amount.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I do love you, Brian. Didn't... Didn't you say my lips look like 'her' lips? Even if you only think of me as a substitute, I'm content as long as I can stay by your side. Please, don't break up with me!" She begged. She could not afford to break up with him no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He let go of his fingers carelessly and sat down on the sofa once more. "It's a pity, but you're not even qualified to be a substitute now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could someone like her be a substitute?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had looked for someone to substitute that person again and again but was disappointed each time. The women he chose always had a part that made him feel like they were "her". However, whenever he spent time with them, he was unable to find the feeling he had felt when he was with that little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the more he tried to grasp it, the less of it he could obtain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn wanted to leap forward and detain him, but the two mansion guards stopped her from going anywhere near Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian..." Evelyn shouted desperately, but Brian did not even bother to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Evelyn was brought out of the living room, the place fell silent once again. Brian glanced at the electronic screen in front of him, and his eyes only fell on Grace's figure on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were her, she would not let him feel such a sense of hopelessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that a woman like her did not care about being a substitute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only he knew in his heart that Evelyn had plotted against him too. The fact of it had made him unhappy for sure, but what made him angry was that Evelyn had plotted against Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the trending online news. In just a few hours, it had changed completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That evening, the internet had directed their curses at her. However, it was now all directed at Evelyn. The tables had turned so quickly it was if it were a series of slaps in one&rsquo;s face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you hire the expert?" Grace asked Jason who was next to her. She did not think that such an authority figure would have had the time to read about her gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Why didn't you tell me about it this afternoon?" Jason asked bluntly. He would not have known about the incident if Terrence had not told him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just don't think it's that big of a deal," said Grace. After all, this sort of thing was nothing compared to what she had experienced in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing is a big deal to you," said Jason. Everything about her was a big deal to him. "I don't like watching my girlfriend bullied."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Therefore, those spammers online are all your doing?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Some of them," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Some?" Grace had a flash of doubt in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled and answered her doubts, "Do you think Evelyn doesn't offend people regularly? A vile person like her suddenly became Brian's girlfriend. How could she be content? She probably doesn't know how many people she has offended."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it. It seemed to be true.</p></div>
