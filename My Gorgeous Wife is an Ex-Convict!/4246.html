        <h1>Chapter 4244 Injured</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two turned around and saw a tall and handsome man standing behind them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's someone in that alley who seems to have been beaten up. And just now, a woman heard it and rushed into the alley," one of them said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other suddenly remembered something, "Right, the person who got beaten up looks a bit like Kit! That retired celebrity..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler didn't bother to listen to what the two were still saying. He immediately ran towards the alley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the person who got beaten up is Kit, then the woman who rushed over is most likely Tina!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina absolutely cannot get into any more trouble!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about when he saw her unconscious in the hospital bed, his heart felt like it was being tightly squeezed, making it hard for him to breathe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he was so afraid that she wouldn't wake up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Chandler arrived in the alley, he only saw Kit lying weakly on the ground while a man was grabbing Tina's collar, mocking and laughing, "Who do you think you are? The daughter of the Stephenson family? The Stephenson family's daughter just came back from being injured not too long ago. Do you think you can run out here all lively to save someone? Do you think I'm an idiot?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's face turned bright red, and because of being grabbed by the collar, speaking became somewhat difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really am the daughter of the Stephenson family. If you touch me, can you really bear the consequences? But if you let go of me and Kit, then we can easily resolve this misunderstanding. It's just a misunderstanding," Tina said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Misunderstanding?" the other person suddenly laughed, "This man actually wants to seduce my mom, and you're still saying it's a misunderstanding. Does the daughter of the Stephenson family really have a relationship with this Kit, as the rumors say? If you really are the daughter of the Stephenson family, then how would your husband Chandler feel when he finds out? Why don't I go tell Mr. Hunter about it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Chandler's face flashed through Tina's mind, and her heart felt like it had been pricked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go find Chandler, this is my own business!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other person sneered, "Haha, you're really putting on a show, but let me tell you today, don't be overly brave, and don't pretend to be the daughter of the Stephenson family to come here and play the hero!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, they swung their fist and were about to hit Tina.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina instinctively closed her eyes, while Kit struggled to try and stand up to intervene!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a hand suddenly intercepted the person's fist in mid-air. Immediately after, those long fingers gripped the person's wrist that was grabbing Tina's collar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person exclaimed in surprise and let go of their hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt her neck loosen, and when she opened her eyes, she saw Chandler's face before her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stared at him in astonishment, "How did you come here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you hurt?" Chandler asked with concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina shook her head, then suddenly thought of something and took a step forward, crouching down and struggling to help Kit, who was lying on the ground and struggling to get up, "I'll take you to the hospital right away!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as she finished speaking, several people emerged from the shadows of the alley.</span></p></div>
