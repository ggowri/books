        <h1>Chapter 2188</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow's eyes glimmered. The power in his house went out twice today while the security system was breached and had not been restored until now. Then, there was such a big scene in the house. When he walked out of his room, he saw several servants on the floor that was scattered with mung beans and bills. It was eye-opening to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Few people would believe him if he told them the culprits of the chaos in the Barlow family this time were two children. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, come here," Philip Barlow said to his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William hesitated but did not move because Jasper's hand was currently gripping his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Daddy, why didn't you tell me that Jasper and her family came today because they found out that I didn't push Nelson Corbyn down the stairs and that they were here to apologize to me?" asked William as he looked at Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow only smiled nonchalantly. "I forgot to tell you, but didn't you find out anyway?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if it was not a big deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William bit his lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow said grimly, "But William, they misunderstood you so badly at the time. Do you think an apology can make up for it? Nobody seemed to believe you when you were there, right? And this Jasper beside you kept saying you pushed Nelson Corbyn down the stairs, didn't she? When the children of the Reed family's servants criticized you and beat you up, what did Jasper, who wants to apologize to you now, do? She just looked on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow spoke slowly, and his smile seemed very kind. However, what he said made Jasper turn pale. Her hand that was holding William&rsquo;s hand was also trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Charlie Barlow said, "That's enough. You're a man. Don't criticize a little girl like that. She's only a few years old!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow smiled faintly. Even a child who was only a few years old could have a tremendous impact on his son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jasper didn't mean to misunderstand me," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, she didn't mean it. But she cares more about Nelson than you. She would have believed you if she cared more about you. She would have believed that you didn&rsquo;t push Nelson Corbyn," Philip Barlow continued saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He spoke like a considerate adult, but every word of his shot straight to the children&rsquo;s hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper listened vaguely, not understanding what he was saying. 'What does he mean by me caring more about Nelson? I treat William and Nelson equally. I love them both!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, William understood. His experience had made him more precocious than ordinary children. He kept silent because he understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William?" Jasper shook William's hand somewhat nervously. Although she did not quite understand what Uncle Barlow said, she did understand one thing. It seemed Uncle Barlow did not want William to forgive her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper suddenly felt scared. Would William... refuse to forgive her and accept her apology? Then... they would not be good friends anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her imagination began to run wild in her head. She instantly hugged William with a cry and burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her crying stunned the grown-ups in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was crying so loudly that others might think it was child abuse! </p></div>
