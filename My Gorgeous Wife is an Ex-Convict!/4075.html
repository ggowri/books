        <h1>Chapter 4073</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But Zabulon, can I bring Eugenia with me that day?" Tina asked. Eugenia was a crazy fan of Kit!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Then let her go in as your assistant. I'll give you two passes," Zabulon said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Thank you, Zabulon!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She felt much better now than before, when Chandler had refused to let her go to the main house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When Eugenia found out that Tina was going to take photos with Kit again, she widened her eyes in shock. "My goodness, what did you do in your past life to have such luck?" she exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you want to be my assistant that day and go in with me?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, of course!" Eugenia replied. She would be crazy not to!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia flattered Tina and massaged her shoulders. "Tina, I'm your loyal assistant. If you tell me to go east, I won't go west!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was amused by her friend's antics!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But what was the theme of the shoot that day? What kind of look will you be doing?" Eugenia asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I don't know. Zabulon said it was confidential, but the photographer for the shoot is Weldon Patel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia suddenly shook, "Is that the Weldon who has won so many awards internationally?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, that's him!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You're really lucky, it's not just as simple as stepping on dog poop!" Eugenia exclaimed. "He's a top photographer, and even with money, it's not easy to hire him! Not only can you shoot with Kit, but you can also collaborate with such a top photographer. You might become very famous!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why do I need to be famous?" Tina laughed. Whether it's a COS shoot or shooting with Kit, it's just something she finds interesting and wants to experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she never thought about whether or not she wanted to be famous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia thought about it and agreed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina, born with a silver spoon in her mouth, can have anything she wants. If she really wants to be famous, the Stephenson family could just buy her a film and television company and promote her directly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Besides, she has an incredibly powerful fianc&eacute;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And her fianc&eacute;'s looks and physique are no worse than those of the top male stars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But speaking of which, did you tell your brother Chandler that you're shooting with Kit?" Eugenia asked casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I just told him I have a shoot this weekend," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why didn't you say it was with Kit?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "There's no need to specifically mention it. He's not a fan of Kit, so even if I told him, he wouldn't come to watch Kit shoot!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Eugenia sometimes felt that her friend was incredibly laid-back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is that what she meant?! Her point was that if they said it was a shoot with Kit, Chandler might get jealous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just thinking about Chandler's calm and composed face, it's really curious to imagine what he would be like if he got jealous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then again, if Chandler really did get jealous and didn't let Tina and Kit shoot together, then it seems like she would be the one losing out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wouldn't be able to see Kit anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So...it's better not to say anything! Eugenia thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, it was time for the shoot, and Eugenia and Tina went to the set together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Eugenia saw Kit, she was very excited and even brought a signed board, "Kit, hello, I'm Eugenia, your fan. Last time I asked Tina to get your autograph for me. Um, if it's not too much trouble, could you sign another one for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she took out the board she had prepared.</p></div>
