  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? She's the God of Star? I can't believe it! The God of Star is a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gasp rippled through the members of the Augustine family as realization dawned upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star had been a savior to the Augustine family on multiple occasions. During the brutal assaults by Everett and Rumen from the League of Divine Descent, and when the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> descended upon them, she had intervened, providing crucial assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But back then, she had no Divine Body, only a fragmented soul hiding deep within the dungeons of the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice had been ancient and commanding, leading them to believe she was an old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, standing before them was a young and strikingly beautiful woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of her took their breath away, filling them with a mix of awe and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star had come to save them once more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, the four green Divine Flames flickering above her head signified her status as a Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Star?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face paled, shock washing over him. He hadn't anticipated that the Augustine family had a Transcendent Deity on their side. This was a serious problem; if things went south, all five of them could end up dead right here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Augustine family has a Transcendent Deity warrior backing them, then we're out of here!" Joseph </span><span>declared,</span><span> his voice laced with urgency as he prepared to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sebastian wasn't about to let that happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation etched on his face, he turned to the God of Star and bowed respectfully. "You can't let them leave! God of Star, please, we need your help to keep them here. If they escape, the Augustine family will face dire consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he finished speaking, Joseph's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph sneered. "Not letting us leave, huh? Afraid we'll go back and spill the beans about your little secrets?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too late for that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've already contacted the Deschanel Clan and filled them in on everything happening here. Soon, more warriors will be on their way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face fell, and the weight of dread settled over the Augustine family like a thick fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer in a hurry to flee, Joseph turned to the God of Star with a calm demeanor. "So, God of Star, I suggest you think twice before sticking around. Once the Deschanel Clan's warriors arrive, even you, as a Transcendent Deity, won't be able to escape. The Augustine family is as good as finished; no one can stop us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arrogance was palpable, echoing through the tension-filled air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star frowned, her voice cold and resolute. "I've already said, the Osborne of the Augustine family has done me a great favor. If you wish to harm them, you'll have to go through me first! Since you're unwilling to leave, then you can stay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she unleashed her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding light erupted from her, enveloping Joseph and his companions in an instant. Their faces turned ashen as they realized the gravity of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time to react; they could only brace themselves for the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, the five of them were sent flying, their bodies crashing into the ground, injuries blooming across their Divine Bodies. Blood spilled from their mouths as they struggled to maintain their forms, the very essence of their beings beginning to unravel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chasm between a Superior Deity and a Transcendent Deity was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star was a Transcendent Deity warrior, far beyond what Joseph and his companions could contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if there were ten of them, they would still be no match!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that the battle has begun, I won't let you leave. You can all perish here," God of Star declared, her voice as frigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she prepared to strike once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face turned pale, and he bellowed, "Stop right there! God of Star, we are from the Deschanel Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Transcendent Deity warrior is on their way here, and you'd better believe they won't let you off the hook if you harm us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, our Deity Overlord clan leader is still alive! If you dare lay a finger on us, he'll personally come after you, and trust me, you won't stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, cease and desist immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star snorted dismissively, "Trying to intimidate me with the Deschanel Clan? Frightening me with your Deity Overlord clan leader? Pathetic! I already told </span><span>you,</span><span> these are not the days of the Age of Gods! The rules of this new world are incomplete; even if your clan leader was once a Deity Overlord, in this new world, they can at most revert to the Transcendent Deity realm, never stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I exterminate you, what can your Deity Overlord clan leader do to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further ado, the God of Star unleashed another devastating attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The formidable assault erupted instantaneously, hurtling towards Joseph and his comrades. Their Ethereal Glow proved utterly insufficient, and innumerable dreadful rays pierced through their Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Divine Bodies were dissolving!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Dissolving Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in the hands of the current God of Star, it was infinitely more powerful than when Osborne had wielded it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph and his companions were utterly overwhelmed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they felt their bodies disintegrating and collapsing, terror and despair filled their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Joseph roared in defiance, yet to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, it was the Augustine family who faced despair under their onslaught. Now, it </span><span>was their turn to experience it under the God of Star's fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family felt an immense sense of vindication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kill us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face was contorted with fear as he begged the God of Star for mercy, hoping she would relent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the God of Star remained expressionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, her countenance hardened as she looked towards the southern sky.</span></p><div class="pagination">
