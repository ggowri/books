  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ten minutes earlier, Osborne activated Satan&rsquo;s Eye, observing the situation inside Clarissa&rsquo;s car at the center of the convoy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he saw that Donna hadn&rsquo;t eaten the candy Paul had prepared, he breathed a sigh of relief. Noticing Paul pressing a button discreetly, a cold smile spread across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Smith, prepare for battle. And remind Ms. Foster up front to be on alert.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet hesitated for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn&rsquo;t understand why Osborne was so certain a battle was imminent, but she didn&rsquo;t question or doubt him. She nodded and began making arrangements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Using the internal communication channel of Skyefall Security Services, she quickly relayed the instructions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne also sent a message on his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the convoy reached the outskirts of the city, Osborne looked at the tall grass by the roadside and said to Violet, &ldquo;Deploy the drone and let it fly high.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet nodded, launching her Draco DF single-soldier reconnaissance drone. She controlled it to fly to a height of a thousand meters before handing the controller to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne maneuvered the drone ahead of the convoy, keeping a close eye on the footage it transmitted back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, Osborne&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here. Hiding there, huh?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet asked, puzzled. She looked at the drone footage but saw only dense weeds, unable to discern anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smirked and pointed to a spot on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The enemies are ambushed here.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet leaned in closer but still saw nothing, her face full of confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t bother explaining.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without Satan&rsquo;s Eye, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to spot the enemies concealed in the grass either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Have everyone prepare for battle.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne ordered directly, &ldquo;Ms. Smith, send some members to this location. Once the fight starts, they should attack from behind.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet nodded and quickly set the plan in motion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A vehicle carrying five bodyguards pulled over swiftly, and the five heavily armed guards moved into the grass, heading towards the spot Osborne indicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, Osborne noticed a large truck following them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sneered and ignored it, turning his focus back to Clarissa&rsquo;s direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ensuring Clarissa&rsquo;s safety was paramount. If anything happened to her, his test as a successor would fail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although he had done everything possible to prepare, the outcome of the battle was uncertain, and unexpected situations could arise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment&rsquo;s thought, Osborne suddenly unleashed ocular energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, his left eye twitched, a sign of imminent danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The battle has begun. Everyone, get out of the vehicles and take cover. Prepare to engage. First, deal with the enemies on the rear truck.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne issued his commands quickly. The convoy had just come to a halt, blocked by trucks at both ends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet led the fourth Bodyguard Unit into swift action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne also got out of the car and quickly made his way towards Clarissa&rsquo;s vehicle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With his enhanced vision, he spotted a rocket launching from the distance, hurtling towards Clarissa&rsquo;s car at high speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Armor-piercing rocket&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne narrowed his eyes. Although Clarissa&rsquo;s car was a specially designed bulletproof vehicle, even resistant to high-caliber sniper rifles, a direct hit from an armor-piercing rocket would penetrate it. The resulting metal jet would incinerate Clarissa and Donna inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let this rocket hit the car directly.&rdquo; Osborne thought, his hands already in motion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His sharpshooting skills, honed through tens of thousands of dollars worth of ammunition, came into play. Despite the rocket&rsquo;s speed, he raised his gun and fired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, bullets struck the rocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before it could reach Clarissa&rsquo;s car, the rocket exploded mid-air. The massive blast wave flipped the car over, but because there was no direct hit, the bulletproof luxury car was not seriously damaged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Glancing over, Osborne noticed Clarissa in the car, being cradled by Donna, unharmed, and he immediately felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, more rockets were fired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smirked and raised his gun again. With Satan&rsquo;s Eye aiding him, the rockets seemed to move in slow motion, becoming easy targets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One by one, the rockets were shot down by Osborne in midair, none managing to come near Clarissa&rsquo;s car to harm her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bodyguards, who had just exited their vehicles, were stunned by the sight, frozen in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna, inside the car, witnessed the scene as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had managed to protect Clarissa, but seeing dozens of rockets streaking towards them, she panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even in their armored car, they couldn&rsquo;t withstand such an assault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But just as she was losing hope, Osborne suddenly appeared, calmly raising his gun and shooting down the rockets one by one in midair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna was dumbfounded, her expression a mix of astonishment and complexity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Osborne reached the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Donna, keep Ms. Clarissa safe and stay inside. Leave the outside to me,&rdquo; Osborne said calmly, his gaze shifting to the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hundreds of fully armed masked individuals were seen swiftly leaving their cover, firing wildly at them.</p><div class="pagination">
