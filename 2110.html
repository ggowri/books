  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's secluded training didn't halt just because his dark elemental essence had reached Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief test of the Eclipse War Armor's power, he wasted no time and dove headfirst into enhancing his final primary elemental power&mdash;lightning elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, after completely absorbing twenty-six Lightning Gold Crystals, his lightning elemental essence finally broke through to Level Ten, just as he had hoped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his entire body was enveloped in a swirling mass of lightning, thousands of electric serpents dancing around him as if they were alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even the ever-rumbling storms of Umbra Earth seemed drawn to him, flashing ominously above his head like a harbinger of doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, these terrifying bolts of lightning merely flickered in the air and didn't strike down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, with Osborne's current strength, even with a Level Ten lightning elemental essence, he might not survive a hit from those Umbra Earth lightning strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, everything has reached Level Ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes, excitement radiating from him. Even his gaze sparkled with faint lightning, casting a unique purplish-red glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he fully processed the flood of information in his mind that the vibrant light in his eyes faded, returning to a calm state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder-based Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Tempestuous Celestial Bolt Descent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, feeling the power of his lightning elemental essence hitting Level Ten, granting him the formidable Tempestuous Celestial Bolt Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This new technique was a significant enhancement over the Multi-thunder Chainstorm he had received upon reaching Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once unleashed, the Tempestuous Celestial Bolt Descent would blanket a vast area with countless purplish-red bolts of lightning. Any living being within that zone would find themselves unable to escape the storm's wrath; every movement would trigger more lightning strikes, and if they couldn't withstand it, they'd be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A wide-area destruction technique!" Osborne thought, satisfaction washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his space, dark, and lightning elemental essences all at Level Ten, Osborne had reached a new level of mastery over these three primary elemental powers. The improvement was nothing short of monumental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, each new Divine Ascendance Technique was incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dimensional Maw had ultimate pinpoint explosion capability!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eclipse War Armor had unmatched defensive strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tempestuous Celestial Bolt Descent had terrifying area attack potential!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to these three techniques, Osborne's combat power had increased at least tenfold compared to before his retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prior to this seclusion, he could easily defeat an average Ascension Five Supernal Deity King without using his absolute forbidden zone. However, he wouldn't have been so confident against a prodigy like Alfreda at Ascension Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was absolutely sure he could take down Alfreda with ease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Alfreda managed to break through to Ascension Six, Osborne felt he could still hold his own in a fight against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "At this point, I might even stand a chance against the top warrior among those entering Umbra Earth&mdash;Uriel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Uriel is an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, but with my absolute forbidden zone, I can suppress his cultivation level to Ascension Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ascension Six Uriel shouldn't be much stronger than an Ascension Six Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my current strength, I can definitely go toe-to-toe with Uriel and maybe even defeat him! But that's assuming he hasn't improved his cultivation level during this time. If he's broken through to Ascension Eight, then I'd be out of my league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the absolute forbidden zone is only effective against those whose cultivation levels are within five ranks higher than mine! If Uriel reaches the Ascension Eight, his cultivation level will be six ranks higher than mine. Then I won't be able to use the zone to suppress his cultivation level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we clash head-on, I'd be doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, the excitement and exhilaration that had filled Osborne moments ago vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to ponder, "My strength still isn't enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can't even handle Uriel, how can I possibly face Lord Malevolence? Lord Malevolence is undoubtedly much stronger than Uriel! Even if Uriel breaks through to Ascension Eight, he wouldn't stand a chance against Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to keep getting stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze hardened with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But how can I grow stronger now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My three primary elemental essences have all reached Level Ten. Even if I could enhance them further, it would be tough to achieve a qualitative breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Level Ten is already at the threshold of Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To push beyond that would require a complete breakthrough to become Sacredness Level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elemental essences at the Sacredness Level aren't easy to come by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how many Element Gold Crystals I have, I can only push my elemental essence to the peak of Level Ten. Breaking into Sacredness Level isn't something I can achieve just with Element Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, continuing to enhance my elemental essences clearly isn't the answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for my physical body, it has already become the Infinite Sacred Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's nearly impossible to improve further; it can only reveal more of its power as my cultivation level rises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So that route is also a dead end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I guess the only option left is to focus on raising my cultivation level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cultivation level was, without a doubt, Osborne's biggest weakness and the hardest to improve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, advancing his cultivation level was a daunting task that required a significant amount of time. But ironically, time was the one thing he lacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "</span><span>There aren</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t </span><span>any quick fixes</span><span> to i</span><span>mproving my cultivation level. Even with more Sacred Crystals, I can't speed up the process! Just eight days ago, I broke through from Ascension One to Ascension Two, and I'm already nearing Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, it's impressive enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wanting to go faster is nearly impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So what can I do to continue boosting my strength? Should I focus on Undead Cataclysm? Or work on Spatial Clone? But they've both already reached Level Eight, and breaking through would take a significant amount of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye is at the peak of Level Ten, so I can't improve it further!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death's Stare is also at Level Ten peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My soul power far exceeds others at the same level; now I can only rely on Primordial to help me gradually improve..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne rapidly assessed his situation, he realized that his overall strength seemed to have hit a bottleneck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To continue advancing, Osborne would either need more precious treasures or a considerable amount of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from that, he could only wait patiently for his cultivation level to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization left Osborne feeling frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! I absolutely can't just sit around waiting for my cultivation level to break through. I can't let my strength stagnate! I need to find a way to keep improving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was unwilling to accept this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, he was already incredibly formidable. With a cultivation level of only Ascension Two, even against Ascension Six opponents, he had a significant chance of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people would be satisfied with that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he had to do was wait patiently for his cultivation level to rise, and his strength would continue to grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was not satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slow pace of his cultivation level increase frustrated him; he wanted to enhance his power in other ways as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "There's no quick way to improve elemental essences, my physical body, and Divine Ascendance Techniques without special treasures. At least, I can't achieve a qualitative change to rapidly boost my strength. So, I'll have to look for alternatives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right! The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity grants me five super abilities, and there's one I've yet to master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is absolute fusion!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
